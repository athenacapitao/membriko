# EPDM Gaskets and Seals for Curtain Wall Facades

## Curtain Wall in Contemporary Portuguese Architecture

Stand in the business districts of Lisbon's Parque das Nações, Porto's Boavista corridor, or any of the major coastal resort developments of the Algarve, and you are surrounded by curtain wall. The continuous glazed facades of office towers, five-star hotels, mixed-use developments and public institutions that define the contemporary Portuguese urban landscape are, almost without exception, curtain wall systems: non-structural aluminium framing assemblies that carry their own weight and wind load while forming the complete external envelope of the building.

What these facades look like from the outside — seamless expanses of glass and anodised aluminium, gleaming in Portugal's exceptional light — tells you almost nothing about what determines whether they perform correctly over the life of the building. That is determined by components that are invisible from the exterior and rarely discussed outside specialist facade engineering circles: the EPDM gaskets and seals that weatherproof every joint, every glazing pocket, every movement interface and every transition to adjacent construction.

Membriko, based in Pombal and operating across Portugal, has built specialist expertise in the supply and specification of EPDM gaskets and profiles for curtain wall systems because this is a field where material quality and technical precision directly determine whether a facade system performs as declared or whether, within a few years of handover, it begins to present water ingress, thermal performance shortfalls, and maintenance costs that no owner or designer anticipated.

This document covers the full scope of EPDM sealing in curtain wall: the system types and their specific demands, the gasket profiles used in each position, thermal break integration, the installation process, material comparisons, weathertightness and acoustic performance, applicable regulations, and answers to the questions that Membriko receives most frequently from architects, facade engineers and main contractors.

## Why EPDM Is the Professional Standard for Curtain Wall Gaskets

The industry's consolidation around EPDM as the gasket material of choice for curtain wall facades is not convention — it is the conclusion of decades of field evidence demonstrating EPDM's superiority over alternatives under real exposure conditions. Membriko grounds this preference in five technical properties that are decisive for curtain wall gasket performance.

### Intrinsic UV Stability — No Degradation on Exposed Facades

The EPDM polymer — Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer — has a fully saturated main chain. The primary polymer backbone contains no carbon-carbon double bonds susceptible to attack by ultraviolet radiation. UV degradation of elastomers proceeds primarily through attack on unsaturated C=C linkages: the more unsaturated the backbone, the more vulnerable the material. EPDM, unlike neoprene (polychloroprene) and natural rubber, has no such sites in its main chain. Its UV resistance is intrinsic to its chemistry, not dependent on UV stabiliser additives that deplete over time.

In Portugal, where annual global horizontal irradiance (GHI) ranges from 1,600 kWh/m² in the north to 2,000 kWh/m² in the Algarve — among the highest values in continental Europe — this matters considerably. The EPDM gaskets in Portuguese curtain wall facades are exposed to some of the most intense UV conditions on the continent. Membriko supplies gaskets with integrated carbon black loading that further reinforces the UV barrier through the depth of the material, not just at the surface.

### Ozone Resistance — Critical in Urban and Coastal Environments

Tropospheric ozone is generated by photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds under solar irradiance — a condition prevalent in the high-traffic urban environments of Lisbon and Porto. Ozone attacks elastomers through electrophilic addition to double bonds in the polymer chain, causing characteristic surface micro-cracking that progresses to visible macroscopic cracking under tension. In coastal environments, where ozone exposure combines with salt spray, the degradation of susceptible elastomers is further accelerated.

EPDM demonstrates the highest ozone resistance of any common elastomer. Standardised testing according to EN ISO 1431 — ozone concentration at 200 parts per billion, specimen under elongation — confirms absence of cracking in EPDM gaskets under conditions that cause visible failure in equivalent neoprene within months. Membriko selects EPDM formulations verified at ozone concentrations representative of peak urban conditions in Portuguese cities.

### Low Compression Set — Sustained Sealing Force Across Decades

A glazing gasket is not a passive gap-filler. It is an elastic system held under continuous compression, whose function is to exert constant contact force against the glass and aluminium frame. The critical property is not the initial compression force at installation — it is the material's ability to maintain that force over decades of service: compression set resistance.

An elastomer with high compression set permanently deforms under sustained compressive load and temperature. The gasket relaxes away from the surfaces it is meant to press against, creating gaps through which water and air infiltrate. Vulcanised EPDM has substantially lower compression set than neoprene or natural rubber under equivalent service conditions. Membriko specifies gaskets with compression set verified to EN ISO 815 (23°C, 22 hours, 25% deflection), requiring values below 25% — the threshold below which long-term sealing effectiveness is maintained.

### Temperature Range from -45°C to +130°C — For All Facade Orientations in Portugal

Portuguese curtain wall facades experience thermal extremes that would surprise anyone unfamiliar with the temperature behaviour of glazed facades. A south-facing facade with dark anodised aluminium framing and low-emissivity coated glass can reach surface temperatures above 70°C on a summer afternoon in Lisbon. The same facade on a building at altitude in the interior highlands can be at -5°C on a January night. The gasket must maintain its elastic properties — and therefore its sealing function — across this entire range without the stiffening that causes loss of contact at low temperature or the softening that causes permanent deformation at high temperature.

EPDM's service range of -45°C to +130°C provides substantial safety margins relative to any climatic condition encountered across mainland Portugal and the islands. Membriko verifies low-temperature flexibility of supplied gaskets to EN ISO 812 and high-temperature compression behaviour under test conditions relevant to the project exposure, providing documentation of temperature performance for inclusion in the facade technical dossier.

### Chemical Inertness — Compatibility with Silicones, Cleaning Agents and Aluminium

A curtain wall system brings multiple materials into close contact: structural silicones bonding glass to carrier frames, weatherseal silicones at movement joints, alkaline or mildly acidic cleaning agents applied by facade maintenance contractors, anodised and powder-coated aluminium components. EPDM is chemically inert to all of these. There is no reaction between EPDM and the silicone sealants in common curtain wall use. Curtain wall cleaning agents do not affect EPDM's physical properties. Contact with anodised aluminium creates neither galvanic corrosion nor gasket degradation.

Membriko verifies chemical compatibility between supplied EPDM gaskets and the specific structural and weatherseal silicones used in each project, confirming the absence of plasticiser migration from the silicone into the adjacent EPDM — a phenomenon that, with incompatible formulations, can compromise the compression set of the gasket over time and undermine the long-term sealing performance of the system.

## Curtain Wall System Types and Their EPDM Requirements

The curtain wall family encompasses several distinct system configurations, each with specific EPDM gasket requirements that Membriko understands in detail.

### Stick Curtain Wall

The dominant system type in Portuguese commercial construction for buildings up to approximately twenty storeys. Vertical mullions and horizontal transoms are assembled on site, piece by piece, anchored to the primary structure at each floor level. After the aluminium framing is complete, glazing units are installed — typically from outside on lower buildings, or from inside where exterior access is restricted — and EPDM gaskets are fitted during the glazing operation.

In stick systems, gaskets are subject to the variability inherent in site installation: weather conditions during fitting, the skill and experience of individual glaziers, and the accessibility of each gasket position. Membriko supplies gaskets with tight dimensional tolerances that partially compensate for this variability, and provides technical guidance to installation teams to ensure that profiles are correctly fitted without forcing, cutting or over-compressing — all of which compromise long-term sealing performance.

### Unitised Curtain Wall

Unitised systems — factory-assembled panels, typically one floor in height and one module in width, delivered to site complete with glass and all components including gaskets — have been gaining market share in Portugal's premium commercial and hospitality sectors, particularly in Grade A+ office developments and five-star hotel projects.

In unitised systems, EPDM gaskets are installed in factory conditions, with quality control standards far more rigorous than site installation allows. Membriko supplies EPDM profiles for unitised panel manufacturers with dimensional tolerances of ±0.2 mm on critical dimensions and 100% visual inspection of profile surfaces, ensuring that every panel leaves the factory with gaskets that fully meet the specification.

The interlocking seals between adjacent unitised panels — where protruding EPDM lips from neighbouring panels compress against each other to form the weatherseal at the panel interfaces — are particularly critical. Membriko dimensions these inter-panel profiles in function of the nominal joint gap between panels, the permitted installation tolerance, and the inter-storey drift under wind and seismic loading.

### Structural Silicone Glazing (SSG)

In structural glazing systems, glass is bonded directly to the aluminium carrier frame with structural silicone adhesive, with no visible mechanical front restraint. The exterior face presents as a continuous glass surface uninterrupted by cap profiles or cover plates. SSG is specified in prestige buildings in Portugal where the architectural intent demands visual continuity of the glazed surface.

In SSG systems, EPDM is present in less visible but equally critical positions: the setting blocks that support each glass unit at the base of the glazing pocket, the EPDM back-bedding material behind the structural silicone bond that defines the silicone bite depth, and weatherseal gaskets in hybrid structural/drained systems where the external seal is complemented by a mechanical element. Membriko specifies SSG setting blocks in EPDM with Shore A hardness appropriate to the glazing unit weight and pocket dimensions, ensuring correct support without excessive indentation that would alter the glass position relative to the structural silicone line.

### Pressure-Equalised Rainscreen Design

Modern curtain wall engineering is founded on the pressure-equalisation principle. The outer gasket is not a watertight seal — it is a drainage barrier that allows water penetrating the joint to drain away harmlessly. The primary water barrier is the inner airtight seal. The air pressure in the cavity between inner and outer seals is equalised with external atmospheric pressure, removing the pressure differential that would otherwise drive water inward past any penetration of the outer barrier.

In this arrangement, the inner EPDM airtight seal is the performance-critical component. It is the gasket that determines whether the system functions as a pressure-equalised rainscreen or simply as a conventional single-seal system. Membriko understands this distinction and applies more stringent compression set, dimensional and installation quality requirements to the inner airtight gasket than to the outer drainage gasket, reflecting the difference in their functional criticality.

## EPDM Gasket Profiles for Curtain Wall — Functions and Geometries

The variety of EPDM profiles required in a curtain wall system is greater than most designers outside specialist facade engineering appreciate. Membriko supplies and specifies the following principal categories.

### Structural Glazing Gaskets (Heel, Wedge and Pressure Gaskets)

Structural glazing gaskets form the bedding and sealing interface between the glazing unit and the aluminium glazing pocket. They are manufactured in multiple cross-sectional geometries: the heel gasket, positioned at the base of the pocket before the glass is inserted; the wedge gasket, driven laterally against the glass after positioning to create sealing contact force; and the pressure gasket, used in systems with an exposed screw-fixed pressure plate.

Each profile cross-section is calculated for the specific combination of pocket dimensions, glass unit thickness, and permitted tolerance gap. Membriko works from the curtain wall system technical data to verify that supplied profiles generate the contact forces specified by the system manufacturer — neither too low (insufficient sealing) nor too high (excessive installation force that damages the gasket or distorts the glass edge).

### Weather Seals and Cap Gaskets

External-face gaskets that cover the joint between adjacent glazing units or between glazing and the aluminium cap profile are in full exposure: direct UV, ozone, rain, sea spray on coastal facades, and the peak surface temperatures of a south-facing facade in direct summer sun.

This is the position where the difference between EPDM and neoprene is most clearly demonstrable in the field. Membriko has conducted inspections of Portuguese curtain wall facades from the 1990s and early 2000s generation, where neoprene external gaskets show characteristic ozone cracking (fine surface cracking in a reticulate pattern oriented perpendicular to the direction of tension), Shore A hardness increases of 15 to 25 points above the original specification, and measurable loss of contact force. EPDM gaskets in equivalent exposure and age show negligible degradation. The evidence is unambiguous.

### Setting Blocks

Setting blocks are short pieces of solid or semi-solid EPDM placed at the base of each glazing pocket to carry the weight of the glass unit and maintain its correct position. They perform a structural function: transferring the self-weight of the glass into the aluminium framing without permanent indentation of the frame, without excessive deformation of the block that would allow the glass to drop in its pocket, and without creating concentrated stress at the lower glass edge.

Correct setting block specification requires knowledge of the weight of each glazing unit (calculated from the glass area and composition — increasingly triple glazed with solar control and acoustic interlayers in Portuguese commercial and hotel projects), the Shore A hardness of the block, and the contact area. Membriko dimensions setting blocks in EPDM Shore A 60 to 80, selected in function of the panel weight, ensuring correct support without creep over the facade service life.

### Movement Gaskets and Expansion Joints

At the interfaces between the curtain wall and adjacent construction elements — concrete floor slabs, masonry returns, window wall transitions, other facade systems — and at expansion joints within the curtain wall system itself, larger-section EPDM profiles are required to accommodate movements beyond the range of standard glazing gaskets.

Movements to be accommodated include: inter-storey drift under wind and seismic loading (typically 20 to 50 mm in tall buildings in Portugal's seismic zones); differential thermal expansion between the facade assembly (aluminium and glass) and the primary structure (concrete or steel); and primary structure settlement. Membriko specifies movement gaskets in function of the movements calculated by the structural engineer, ensuring that the EPDM profile accommodates the full design movement range without loss of watertightness.

### Unitised Panel Inter-Panel Seals

Unitised systems require specific EPDM interlocking seal profiles for the joints between adjacent panels — vertical (between horizontally adjacent panels) and horizontal (between vertically stacked panels). These profiles typically feature multiple sealing lips and pressure-equalisation chambers in their cross-section, designed to interlock precisely when two panels are installed against each other on the structure.

Membriko supplies these profiles in precisely cut roll lengths, with cross-sectional profile verification by laser camera at the extrusion line, ensuring that every linear metre of profile will fulfil its interlocking sealing function as specified.

## Thermal Break Integration and Energy Performance

The thermal performance of a curtain wall system — expressed as the overall system thermal transmittance Uw, calculated to EN ISO 12631 — incorporates contributions from every component: the glazing unit (Ug value), the thermally broken aluminium profile (Uf value), and the linear glazing gasket (Ψg value). EPDM gasket quality affects the in-service thermal performance through two distinct mechanisms.

### Air Infiltration — The Invisible Thermal Penalty

A curtain wall system with degraded gaskets — that have lost contact force through permanent compression set or that have cracked under ozone attack — permits air infiltration not accounted for in the declared Uw value. Air infiltration increases heat flow through the facade non-linearly: even modest infiltration rates, expressed in m³/h per metre of facade, contribute significantly to the heating and cooling energy consumption of a building with large glazed facade area.

In buildings subject to RECS (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Comércio e Serviços — the Portuguese commercial building energy performance regulation), infiltration from degraded gaskets can push the in-service energy consumption above the thresholds for the declared energy performance class, even if the nominally declared Uw of the facade system remains compliant. Membriko systematically includes analysis of the gasket impact on in-service thermal performance in its specification recommendations.

### The Gasket in the Linear Thermal Transmittance Calculation Ψg

The linear glazing gasket enters directly into the calculation of the Ψg factor, which quantifies the additional thermal transmittance at the glass perimeter relative to the centre of the panel. A correctly dimensioned and hardness-specified EPDM gasket that supports the glass in the intended position and fills the glazing pocket without gaps minimises the Ψg value. An incorrectly sized gasket — too small, leaving gaps; or too large, forcing the glass out of the designed position — increases Ψg and degrades the calculated system thermal performance.

Membriko coordinates with facade engineers on gasket dimensioning to ensure that the profile supplied is geometrically consistent with the profiles used in the system's Ψg calculation, guaranteeing that the in-service performance matches the calculated performance declared in the system's technical documentation.

---

## Installation Process — The EPDM Gasket Sequence

Curtain wall installation is a rigidly sequenced process where each stage conditions the next. Membriko documents here the role of EPDM gaskets at each relevant phase.

### Pre-Installation Verification

Before glazing commences, Membriko recommends sample verification of gaskets: measurement of critical cross-sectional dimensions (nominal width and height), manual insertion force test in the aluminium profile, and visual surface inspection. Gaskets with surface defects — tears, bubbles, cross-sectional variations — are identified and replaced before incorporation in the system. This pre-installation check is particularly important for projects where gasket profiles have been stored on site for extended periods before use.

### Heel Gasket Installation

The heel gasket is the first element installed in the glazing pocket — before the glass. It is pressed to the base of the pocket ensuring continuous coverage without overlaps or gaps. At corners, the gasket is cut and cut ends are treated with a compatible EPDM contact adhesive to ensure continuity. Membriko supplies heel gaskets in precisely cut lengths for each module perimeter, eliminating the need for site cutting and the associated risk of dimensional error.

### Setting Block Placement

Setting blocks are positioned at one-quarter and three-quarters of the width of each glass panel, centred on the glass thickness. The exact position is determined by the design engineer based on the weight and dimensions of each glass unit. Membriko supplies setting blocks with reference marking (hardness grade and dimension code) to prevent site confusion between blocks of different specifications on projects where multiple glass weights are used in the same facade.

### Glass Positioning and Wedge Gasket Installation

After glass position is confirmed and checked, the wedge gasket is driven laterally into position — typically using a profile-specific insertion tool — to create contact force between the glass, the gasket and the inner leg of the aluminium profile. The wedge gasket insertion force is the parameter that controls sealing pressure: too low, and the seal is insufficient; too high, and the gasket suffers permanent deformation that compromises its long-term compression set performance.

Membriko specifies wedge gasket geometry so that manual installation force by a glazier using a standard insertion tool produces the correct compression — eliminating dependence on individual installer technique for achieving the specified sealing contact force.

### External Gasket and Cap Profile Installation

External gaskets and cap profiles are installed at the end of the glazing sequence, after correct positioning of all glass units has been confirmed. They are pressed into position using tools that guarantee uniform insertion depth across the full length of each profile. At corners, compatible silicone sealant is injected where EPDM profile continuity is geometrically impossible. Membriko specifies corner sealant compatibility with both the EPDM gasket and the aluminium surface finish for each project.

## EPDM vs Silicone vs Neoprene — The Professional Comparison

The gasket material decision in curtain wall projects is too often reduced to unit cost. Membriko presents the complete technical analysis that demonstrates why this reduction is an error with consequences visible twenty years later.

| Property | EPDM (Membriko) | Silicone | Neoprene |
|---|---|---|---|
| UV resistance | Excellent (saturated backbone) | Excellent | Poor to moderate |
| Ozone resistance | Excellent | Excellent | Poor |
| Compression set (EN ISO 815, 23°C, 22h, 25% deflection) | < 25% | 20-35% | 30-50% |
| Service temperature range | -45°C to +130°C | -60°C to +200°C | -35°C to +100°C |
| Abrasion resistance | Good | Poor | Good |
| Relative material cost | Low to moderate | High | Low |
| Compatibility with structural silicone | Excellent | Excellent | Verify per case |
| Expected service life on Portuguese facade | 40-50 years | 30-40 years | 15-25 years |
| EN 13830 compliance | Yes | Yes | Yes (with durability limitations) |

### The Case for and Against Silicone Gaskets

Silicone gaskets have genuine technical advantages — their temperature range is broader than EPDM and their compression set performance is competitive with EPDM in high-quality formulations. However, silicone's significantly higher material cost relative to EPDM is rarely justified in conventional curtain wall applications where extreme temperature exposure is not the limiting factor. Silicone also has lower abrasion resistance, which matters in positions where the gasket is subjected to friction during glass installation. Membriko specifies silicone gaskets only in applications with specific temperature requirements or where compatibility with aggressive cleaning agents is the design driver.

### The Case Against Neoprene

Neoprene was widely used in curtain wall applications until the late 1990s, when field evidence of its accelerated degradation under UV and ozone exposure made EPDM the professional specification standard. Membriko has inspected Portuguese curtain wall facades with neoprene gaskets of fifteen to twenty years' age and documents consistently: reticulate surface cracking characteristic of ozone attack, Shore A hardness increases of 15 to 25 points above original specification values, loss of contact force measurable against the original installation records, and the beginning of water ingress at joints that had adequate sealing when first installed.

The replacement of neoprene gaskets with EPDM is, for these facades, a maintenance investment that restores the original designed weathertightness performance of the system and extends the service life by a further forty to fifty years without further gasket intervention.

---

## Weathertightness Performance

EN 13830 establishes a classification structure for curtain wall system performance across four primary protection functions. EPDM gaskets are a determining component in each classification.

### Air Permeability — EN 12152 and EN 12153

Air permeability classification runs from Class A1 (maximum permitted infiltration) to Class A4 (minimum infiltration — ≤ 0.2 m³/h·m² at 100 Pa). For Grade A+ office buildings and five-star hotels in Portugal, project specifications typically require Class A3 or A4.

The EPDM gaskets at the inner airtight seal line are the components that determine the air permeability test result. Membriko verifies that the geometry and hardness of supplied gaskets are consistent with the air permeability performance declared by the curtain wall system manufacturer, ensuring that the gasket is not the weakest link in the performance chain.

### Water Tightness — EN 12154 and EN 12155

Water tightness classification runs from E0 (unclassified) to E1500 (watertight at 1500 Pa differential pressure). For exposed facades on tall buildings, Class E750 or E1000 is the common specification. On facades in severely exposed zones — the Atlantic coast north of Lisbon, the Madeira and Azores islands — Class E1200 or higher may be required.

In pressure-equalised rainscreen systems, water tightness depends primarily on the integrity of the inner airtight EPDM seal. Membriko dimensions and specifies this gasket with particular rigour, as its failure compromises the PER principle entirely and transforms what should be a drainage barrier system into a conventional single-seal system without the redundancy that justifies the PER classification.

### Wind Resistance — EN 12179

The wind resistance test verifies structural element deflection under positive and negative design wind pressures — typically 2,400 to 3,200 Pa for tall buildings in Portuguese exposed locations. EPDM setting blocks and perimeter gaskets must accommodate frame deflection under these loads while maintaining contact with the glass. A gasket with excessive compression set or a setting block that has permanently deformed under sustained load may lose glass contact under the deflection that occurs at peak wind pressure — precisely the moment when maintaining the seal is most critical.

### Acoustic Performance — EN ISO 10140-2

EPDM gaskets contribute to curtain wall sound reduction index (Rw) through two mechanisms: sealing air gaps that are the primary transmission paths for sound by permeability, and viscoelastically decoupling the glass from the rigid aluminium frame, reducing the structural flanking transmission of vibration through the glazing perimeter. This second mechanism is frequently underestimated in facade acoustic analyses, but is measurable in systems where a larger-section or softer EPDM gasket replaces a smaller or stiffer one.

In hotel facade design in Portugal — where national noise regulations and the requirements of tourism establishment licensing require facade sound reduction sufficient to protect guest room acoustic comfort — Membriko coordinates with acoustic consultants to specify gaskets that maximise the acoustic contribution within the constraints of the glazing system geometry.

## Maintenance and Gasket Replacement

EPDM curtain wall gaskets that have been correctly specified and installed have an expected service life of forty to fifty years in Portuguese climatic conditions. This is not a theoretical claim: it is supported by the field performance data of EPDM in European curtain wall installations from the 1970s and 1980s, which have reached decades of service without gasket replacement.

However, Portugal's existing building stock includes a significant number of curtain wall facades with neoprene gaskets installed in the 1990s that have reached or exceeded their service life, and facades with EPDM gaskets of lower quality or incorrectly installed that are presenting premature failure. Membriko's maintenance and replacement services address both categories.

### Recommended Inspection Protocol

Membriko recommends curtain wall gasket inspection at minimum five-year intervals, including:

**Visual inspection**: Survey of accessible and facade-maintenance-access-point areas for surface cracking indicative of ozone or UV degradation, visible gasket displacement from position, localised hardening or softening, and soiling patterns at joints that indicate water is tracking through the gasket line.

**Manual compression test**: Assessment of residual elasticity in accessible gaskets — compression by finger and observation of immediate recovery. Gaskets that do not recover full shape within 2 to 3 seconds have excessive compression set and should be subject to formal testing.

**Air permeability spot test**: Measurement of infiltration rate at accessible zones, compared against the system's original performance classification.

### Replacement Strategy

External gasket replacement — weather seals, cap gaskets, exposed cover strip seals — can typically be carried out without glass removal, using extraction and insertion tools designed for the profile geometry. This is the most common maintenance replacement scenario and can be executed by trained glazing contractors using Membriko-supplied replacement profiles matched to the original gasket specification.

Inner glazing gasket replacement (heel and wedge gaskets within the glazing pocket) generally requires temporary glass removal. Membriko provides technical support for planning these operations, including the removal and re-glazing sequence and the safety requirements for glass handling at height on multi-storey facades.

The cost of proactive gasket replacement — typically between 15% and 25% of the cost of a complete re-glazing — compares very favourably with the accumulated cost of water ingress remediation in occupied commercial buildings, where each infiltration incident involves inspection, diagnosis, interior damage repair, and potential disruption to building occupants and operations.

## Portuguese High-Rise Construction and Facade Compliance

### Seismic Exposure and Curtain Wall Design

Portugal is one of Europe's most seismically active countries. EN 1998-1 (Eurocode 8: Seismic design of structures) and Portuguese national seismic design regulations define requirements for tall buildings in the country's seismic zones. Curtain wall systems, as non-structural elements, must accommodate the inter-storey drift imposed during a seismic event without glass breakage or panel ejection.

EPDM gaskets play an active role in this accommodation: the elasticity of the material allows the glass to move within the glazing pocket during a seismic event, absorbing energy and reducing the stresses transmitted to the glass edges. Membriko dimensions clearances and gasket hardnesses in coordination with facade engineers to ensure that the glass has sufficient mobility within the panel without risk of ejection or impact with the frame at the drift limits defined by the structural engineer.

### Atlantic Wind Exposure

Portugal's Atlantic coast north of Lisbon and the island territories of Madeira and the Azores are exposed to Atlantic wind systems of high intensity, with peak gust speeds that frequently exceed the design values applicable to sheltered inland locations. Office buildings and hotels in these exposed zones require curtain wall systems with wind resistance and water tightness classifications above those of standard inland applications.

For these applications, Membriko specifies external gaskets with larger cross-sectional area that maintain higher contact force under the increased frame deflection caused by elevated wind pressures, and that resist the extraction forces that tend to pull external gaskets out of their retention positions at peak negative pressure.

### Salt Spray Exposure

Buildings on seafronts and in coastal zones exposed to salt-laden airborne moisture place specific demands on facade materials. EPDM is intrinsically inert to sodium chloride and other marine salts: unlike the aluminium, steel fixings and silicone sealants in the curtain wall assembly — all of which require specific corrosion protection for marine exposure — EPDM gaskets are unaffected by marine environments. Membriko confirms formulation compatibility with sustained salt spray exposure for gaskets supplied to coastal projects, providing the documentation of chemical inertness required by some project specifications.

## Regulations and Standards

The specification of curtain wall EPDM gaskets in Portugal is governed by a framework of European standards and national regulations that Membriko applies systematically.

**EN 13830:2003+A1:2020** — Curtain Walling. Product Standard. The primary compliance standard defining classification, testing and CE marking requirements for curtain wall systems. EPDM gaskets are part of the system assessed to this standard.

## Acoustic and Fire Performance

### Acoustic Contribution of EPDM Gaskets

Acoustic performance of the building facade is a critical compliance requirement in Portuguese hotel and residential projects. The national noise framework (Decreto-Lei 9/2007, Regulamento Geral do Ruído) and the specific requirements for tourism establishment licensing define maximum indoor noise levels and minimum facade sound reduction values. For buildings in noise-sensitive or mixed-use classification zones, facade sound reduction requirements can reach D2m,nT,w of 35 to 45 dB.

EPDM gaskets contribute to these values in two ways. The sealing function eliminates air gaps at glazing perimeters and panel joints — gaps that, even when small, provide direct acoustic transmission paths that degrade the system Rw. The viscoelastic decoupling function reduces the transmission of structural vibration energy from the glass panel into the aluminium frame, attenuating one of the flanking paths that limit the system's acoustic performance.

Membriko coordinates with the acoustic consultants on projects where curtain wall Rw is a critical design parameter, specifying gasket hardness and cross-sectional area to maximise the acoustic contribution while remaining within the glazing system's geometric constraints.

### Fire Behaviour of EPDM Gaskets

EPDM is a combustible material — as are all organic polymers. Its fire reaction classification to EN 13501-1 is typically Euroclass E (passes no flame spread test, does not produce flaming droplets) in standard formulations, or Euroclass D in formulations containing flame retardant additives.

For curtain wall applications in Portugal subject to Portaria 1532/2008, the contribution of EPDM gaskets to the facade fire load must be within the limits permitted for the building use-type and occupancy classification. Membriko supplies fire reaction classification documentation for all gasket products and can specify flame-retardant formulations where regulatory requirements demand a higher classification.

EPDM weatherseal gaskets do not provide fire resistance performance — that function is provided by specific intumescent seals and fire-rated glazing systems that are separate components of the curtain wall assembly. Membriko can advise on the interface between standard EPDM weatherseals and the fire-rated elements of the curtain wall where both are required in the same facade system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between an EPDM gasket and a neoprene gasket in a curtain wall?**

A: The fundamental difference is long-term durability in outdoor exposure. Both are vulcanised elastomers with equivalent sealing functions when new. But neoprene (polychloroprene) contains unsaturations in its polymer backbone that make it susceptible to ozone and UV attack — the dominant environmental degradation mechanisms on exposed facades. The result, documented in inspections of Portuguese facades from the 1990s, is ozone cracking and hardening of neoprene within fifteen to twenty years of installation. EPDM, with its saturated backbone, maintains its properties for forty to fifty years in the same exposure conditions. Membriko specifies exclusively EPDM for new installations and for gasket replacement programmes in existing curtain wall facades.

**Q: How often should EPDM gaskets in a curtain wall be inspected?**

A: Membriko recommends visual inspection of accessible facade zones annually, and a full technical inspection with specialist access equipment every five years. The technical inspection should include compression set assessment, air infiltration spot testing, and joint inspection with moisture detection where infiltration is suspected. Buildings in severely exposed locations — Atlantic coast, altitude, high-traffic urban environments — benefit from more frequent inspection intervals of three years. The inspection cost is a small fraction of the cost of reactive water ingress remediation.

**Q: Is EPDM compatible with the structural silicone used in curtain wall systems?**

A: Yes. EPDM does not react chemically with the one-component and two-component structural silicones in common curtain wall use. Membriko verifies the specific compatibility of supplied EPDM gaskets with the structural silicone specified for each project, confirming that there is no plasticiser migration from silicone to adjacent EPDM that could affect the gasket's long-term compression set performance or the silicone's adhesion to adjacent substrates.

**Q: Can curtain wall gaskets be replaced without removing the glass?**

A: It depends on the gasket position. External gaskets — weather seals, cap gaskets, exposed cover strip seals — can typically be replaced without glass removal, using extraction and re-insertion tools designed for the profile geometry. Inner glazing pocket gaskets (heel and wedge) generally require temporary glass removal. Membriko assesses the most appropriate replacement strategy for each situation based on the curtain wall system type, gasket position and available site access equipment.

**Q: What Shore A hardness is recommended for curtain wall gaskets in Portugal?**

A: Specification depends on the curtain wall system, glass unit weight and dimensions, and exposure conditions. As a general reference: glazing gaskets (heel and wedge) are specified between 50 and 65 Shore A; setting blocks between 60 and 80 Shore A depending on glass panel weight; external weather seals and cap gaskets between 45 and 55 Shore A. Membriko dimensions gaskets against the specific technical data of each curtain wall system, ensuring that the contact forces are appropriate to the sealing function required in each position.

**Q: How does EPDM gasket quality affect the declared thermal performance of a curtain wall?**

A: In two ways. Directly: the linear thermal transmittance factor Ψg is calculated using the gasket geometry assumed in the project; if the supplied gasket differs dimensionally, the in-service Ψg diverges from the calculated value, affecting the system Uw. Indirectly: degraded or incorrectly installed gaskets permit air infiltration not accounted for in the declared Uw, increasing the real heat flow through the facade above the declared value. In buildings subject to RECS compliance, gasket degradation can push in-service energy consumption above the declared performance class threshold. Membriko coordinates with facade engineers to specify gaskets that ensure consistency between calculated and in-service thermal performance.

**Q: Does Membriko supply custom EPDM profiles for specific curtain wall systems?**

A: Yes. Membriko works with EPDM profile manufacturers offering custom extrusion capability, enabling the development of project-specific cross-sections for curtain wall systems where standard profiles are not suitable. The custom profile development process includes: survey of the glazing pocket geometry and required contact forces, cross-section design, prototype production, compression testing, dimensional confirmation, and conformity certification. Membriko manages this process on behalf of the specifier or the curtain wall manufacturer.

**Q: What are the regulatory requirements for curtain wall gaskets in Portugal?**

A: Curtain wall gaskets in Portugal are governed primarily by EN 13830 (curtain wall product standard), which defines the system requirements of which gaskets form part. EN 682 defines dimensional tolerance requirements for extruded rubber profiles. Gasket material properties are verified to EN ISO 37 (tensile and elongation), EN ISO 815 (compression set), EN ISO 1431 (ozone resistance) and EN ISO 188 (thermal ageing). Membriko provides complete conformity documentation for all supplied gaskets, compatible with the system performance declaration requirements under EN 13830 and with the quality audit requirements of main contractors and client quality assurance programmes.
