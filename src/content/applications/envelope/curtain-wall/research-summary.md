# Curtain Wall (Fachada Cortina) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Curtain wall systems are non-structural glazing facades attached to the primary building structure,
forming the external envelope of mid-rise and high-rise buildings. The curtain wall carries only
its own weight and wind load — it does not support floor or roof loads. This structural independence
means the facade can be designed as a continuous, highly engineered assembly of glass, metal framing,
and — critically — EPDM gaskets and seals that maintain weathertightness across every joint, every
glazing pocket and every movement accommodation detail.

EPDM is the material of choice for curtain wall gaskets in Europe because no other elastomer
combines the necessary properties: UV stability, ozone resistance, temperature flexibility across
the full service range, long-term compression set resistance, and chemical inertness to glazing
sealants and cleaning agents. The curtain wall industry standardised on EPDM decades ago and the
specification of alternative gasket materials (neoprene, silicone, EPDM/polysulphide hybrids) is
declining across the professional sector.

## Curtain Wall System Types

### Stick Curtain Wall
The dominant system in Portuguese commercial construction. Mullions and transoms are assembled on
site, piece by piece, anchored to the primary structure at floor levels. Glazing units are installed
from inside or outside after the frame is complete. EPDM gaskets — both setting blocks and
perimeter glazing gaskets — are installed during the glazing operation. Stick systems require
continuous EPDM gaskets at every glass edge and at every frame-to-frame joint.

### Unitised Curtain Wall
Factory-assembled panels, typically one floor in height and one bay in width, delivered to site
complete with glass and all components including EPDM gaskets. Panels interlock at site with
EPDM pressure-equalised seals between adjacent units. Unitised systems offer superior quality
control for gaskets (factory installation under controlled conditions) and faster site erection.
The growing market share of unitised systems in Portuguese high-rise projects from 2010 onwards
has increased demand for EPDM gasket profiles.

### Structural Silicone Glazing (SSG)
Glass is bonded directly to the aluminium carrier frame with structural silicone adhesive, with
no mechanical front restraint. The external face of the facade appears as continuous glass.
EPDM is used as back-bedding and setting-block material behind the structural silicone joint,
and for weatherseal gaskets in the pressure plate system if a hybrid structural/drained system
is used. The structural silicone itself is not EPDM, but EPDM components are present in every
SSG system.

### Pressure-Equalised Rainscreen (PER) Design
Modern curtain wall design uses the pressure-equalisation principle: the outer gasket is a
drainage barrier (not a true seal), and an inner airtight seal (EPDM gasket) prevents water
from being driven past any water that penetrates the outer skin. The air pressure between outer
and inner seals is equalised with the external environment, removing the driving force for water
penetration. EPDM is the preferred material for both the outer drainage gasket and the inner
airtight seal in PER systems.

## EPDM Gasket and Seal Types in Curtain Wall

### Structural Glazing Gaskets
Extruded EPDM profiles that hold the glazing unit in the frame pocket. These are precisely
engineered cross-sections — typically 15-40 mm in depth — designed to accommodate glass weight,
wind deflection of the frame, and thermal movement of the glass unit relative to the frame.
Tolerances are tight: glazing gaskets must maintain continuous contact force across the full
perimeter of the glass unit under all service conditions.

### Weather Seals and Cap Gaskets
External-face gaskets that cover the joint between adjacent glazing units or between glazing
and frame elements. These face full UV and weather exposure. EPDM's ozone resistance and UV
stability (intrinsic to its saturated carbon backbone and carbon black loading) make it far
more durable than neoprene in this exposed position.

### Thermal Break Gaskets
Used at the interface between inner and outer aluminium sections of thermally broken curtain
wall frames, preventing conductive heat bridging. Often polyamide strips rather than EPDM,
but some thermal break systems incorporate EPDM compression gaskets as part of the insulating
assembly.

### Setting Blocks
Short blocks of solid or semi-solid EPDM placed at the bottom of each glazing pocket to
support the weight of the glass unit and maintain correct positioning. Setting blocks must
maintain their geometry under sustained load (creep resistance) across the full temperature
range. EPDM's low compression set is the critical property here.

### Joint Fillers and Movement Gaskets
At interfaces between curtain wall panels and adjacent construction elements (concrete structure,
masonry returns, window wall transitions), EPDM extrusions are used as movement-accommodating
seals. These must handle inter-story drift, thermal expansion and the differential movement
between the curtain wall and the primary structure.

## Portuguese High-Rise and Commercial Construction Context

Portugal's commercial construction sector — particularly in Lisbon, Porto, and the Algarve coastal
resort corridor — has seen significant curtain wall specification in office towers, hotels, mixed-use
developments and public buildings since the late 1990s. The economic recovery post-2014 brought
a new wave of commercial construction in the Lisbon waterfront, Porto's eastern expansion corridors,
and the Algarve, all featuring curtain wall facades.

Key Portuguese project types where EPDM curtain wall gaskets are specified:
- Office towers (Torres de Lisboa, Centro Empresarial de Alfragide, Parque das Nações)
- Hotel developments (resort hotels along Algarve coast, Lisbon urban hotels)
- Public buildings (government offices, courts, university buildings post-Bologna process)
- Retail centres (shopping centres with glazed facades and curtain wall anchor stores)
- Residential towers (luxury apartment developments in Cascais, Estoril, Vilamoura)

The Portuguese construction specification pipeline for curtain wall follows European norms
closely, with EN 13830 (Curtain Walling — Product Standard) as the primary compliance framework.

## Performance Requirements

### Air Permeability
EN 12153 test: at 600 Pa test pressure, high-quality curtain wall systems achieve Class 4
(≤ 1.08 m³/h·m²). EPDM gaskets are the primary component controlling air infiltration at
mullion-to-transom joints and at glazing perimeters.

### Water Tightness
EN 12155 test: Class E1200 or higher for exposed high-rise applications. EPDM gaskets at
the inner seal line of a pressure-equalised system must maintain airtightness even when
water has penetrated the outer drainage barrier.

### Wind Resistance
EN 12179 test: deflection limits for structural elements. The EPDM setting blocks and
perimeter gaskets must accommodate frame deflection under design wind load without losing
contact with the glass.

### Thermal Performance
EN ISO 12631: whole-curtain-wall U-value calculation. EPDM has low thermal conductivity
relative to metals but is not a primary thermal insulator. Its role in thermal performance
is to eliminate infiltration (which dominates heat loss at joints) and to support the
glazing unit without creating conductive bridges between glass edge and frame.

### Acoustic Performance
EN ISO 10140-2: sound reduction index. EPDM gaskets contribute to acoustic performance
by sealing air gaps and by decoupling the glass from the rigid aluminium frame, reducing
flanking transmission. This is particularly relevant for hotel facade design in Portugal,
where acoustic comfort standards for guest rooms require Rw ≥ 35 dB for facades in
urban or coastal noise environments.

## Ozone and UV Resistance — Critical for Portuguese Climate

Portugal's Mediterranean and Atlantic climate creates specific demands on curtain wall EPDM:
- UV irradiance is among the highest in continental Europe (annual GHI 1,600-2,000 kWh/m²)
- Ozone levels in urban areas can affect unprotected elastomers
- Temperature cycling is significant: Lisbon facades can range from -2°C (winter night,
  north-facing) to +70°C (summer day, south-facing, black anodised frame)

Neoprene (polychloroprene) gaskets, once standard in curtain wall, are significantly less
UV and ozone resistant than EPDM. Field inspection of Portuguese curtain wall facades from
the 1980s and 1990s — when neoprene was more commonly specified — shows widespread gasket
degradation (hardening, cracking, shrinkage, loss of contact pressure) within 15-20 years.
EPDM gaskets in comparable exposures show negligible degradation over the same period.

## Regulations and Standards

**EN 13830:2003+A1:2020** — Curtain Walling — Product Standard. The primary compliance
standard for curtain wall systems in the EU. Specifies classification, testing and marking
requirements. EPDM gaskets are part of the system tested to this standard.

**EN 12152** — Air permeability classification
**EN 12153** — Air permeability test method
**EN 12154** — Water tightness classification
**EN 12155** — Water tightness test method
**EN 12179** — Wind resistance test method
**EN ISO 12631** — Thermal performance calculation
**EN ISO 10140** — Acoustic performance measurement

**ETAG 034** (European Technical Approval Guideline): Kit for external wall claddings.
Used for CE marking of curtain wall kits prior to the adoption of EN 13830 as a
harmonised standard. Relevant for older product documentation.

**Portuguese Building Energy Regulations**: REH (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos
Edifícios de Habitação) and RECS (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de
Comércio e Serviços) set minimum U-value requirements for facade elements including curtain
wall. EPDM gasket quality directly affects whether a curtain wall system achieves the
declared U-value in service, as infiltration around poorly fitted or degraded gaskets
increases effective U-value.

## Research Notes and Gaps

- Limited Portuguese-language technical literature on curtain wall gasket performance
  in Atlantic/Mediterranean climates; most documentation is Northern European
- Accelerated ageing data for EPDM gasket compression set in Portuguese temperature cycling
  conditions would strengthen the long-term warranty case
- The interaction between structural silicone sealant and adjacent EPDM gasket material
  requires careful specification to avoid plasticiser migration from silicone affecting
  EPDM compression set over time
- Acoustic performance data specifically for EPDM vs neoprene gaskets in curtain wall
  systems is sparse in published literature; most performance claims are system-level
