# Facades — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The facades page occupies a different persuasion territory from the roofing pages. Facades are not the most common single application for EPDM in Portugal, but they represent a high-value, technically sophisticated segment where Membriko's ability to explain the underlying engineering clearly will differentiate us sharply from competitors who do not even acknowledge the role of a behind-cladding water-control layer.

The target audience for this page is broader than for some other applications: it includes architects specifying ventilated facade systems for new-build apartments and commercial buildings; building owners in renovation who have experienced ETICS failure at window junctions and parapets; civil engineers and facade consultants specifying water-control membranes for high-exposure coastal buildings; and construction managers who have been told by a membrane supplier that "EPDM can work on facades" and want to understand how and why before they commit.

The page must accomplish three things:

1. Educate the reader that a behind-cladding membrane is not optional in Portuguese driving rain conditions — it is the difference between a facade that works for 50 years and one that fails within 15.
2. Establish that EPDM is the technically superior choice for this role relative to house wraps, bituminous underlays, and liquid membranes — and explain concisely why.
3. Convert the reader into a Membriko enquiry by demonstrating that Membriko understands every facade type (rainscreen, ETICS, curtain wall backup, rehabilitation) and can deliver a verified, warranted result.

The persuasion arc differs from the roofing pages because the reader is less likely to be experiencing an emergency (active leak through roof) and more likely to be in a specification or design phase. The tone should be authoritative and educational, with clear differentiation between facade systems rather than a single-product pitch.

Section order follows this arc:
1. Establish the problem — Portugal's facades are at risk from driving rain and ETICS failure
2. Explain the role of the behind-cladding membrane — not decoration, not optional
3. EPDM material science — why it outperforms the alternatives intrinsically
4. Four facade system types with EPDM application — rainscreen, ETICS, curtain wall, rehabilitation
5. Air and water barrier functions — dual role and why both matter for energy performance
6. Installation process — step by step for a facade project
7. Detailing — the most failure-prone locations and how Membriko addresses each
8. EPDM vs alternatives — direct, factual comparison
9. Breathability and vapour management — the nuance that separates good specifiers from bad ones
10. Technical specifications table
11. Maintenance — (there is essentially none, which is a selling point)
12. Portuguese ETICS failures — establish the problem in Portuguese-specific terms
13. Regulatory framework (EN 13859-2, REH, CE marking)
14. Energy performance integration — the thermal bridge and airtightness angle
15. FAQ — 8 questions covering the most common specifier and owner doubts
16. CTA

## Section 1: Introduction — Facades as the Building's Immune System

**Purpose:** Establish stakes and anchor the reader in the problem before any product mention.

**Content:**
- Headline: The facade is the building's immune system. When it fails, everything inside is at risk.
- Opening narrative: Driving rain in Portugal is not a minor hazard — Class 3 and Class 4 driving rain intensities on northwest-facing facades in Porto, Viana do Castelo, and the Algarve coast are among the highest in Europe. Every facade joint, every window perimeter, every cladding panel edge is a potential water entry point.
- Frame the role of the behind-cladding membrane: not to replace the cladding but to ensure that any water that penetrates the primary surface is stopped before it reaches the structure, insulation, and interior.
- Membriko introduction: Membriko has delivered EPDM facade membrane installations across Portugal, from ventilated facade systems on new-build apartment blocks to rehabilitation of ETICS systems with active infiltrations at window junctions.
- Three stat blocks: 50+ years proven service life / Class A driving rain resistance (EN 12865) / 400% elongation to bridge structural movement

**Design note:** Consider a dramatic photograph of a Portuguese building facade with visible water damage or biological staining on the render — the visual stakes before the solution is presented.

## Section 2: Why a Behind-Cladding Membrane Is Not Optional

**Purpose:** Establish the argument that a secondary water control layer is an engineering necessity, not an optional upgrade.

**Content:**

Four reasons presented as expandable blocks or as a two-column grid:

1. **No cladding system is watertight at every joint under driving rain.**
   Open-jointed rainscreen systems are designed to admit water and drain it — the membrane is the design assumption, not an afterthought. Even nominally sealed claddings (ceramic tile, stone with pointed joints) develop joint failures within 5-15 years through mortar shrinkage, thermal movement, and carbonation. When they do, water enters directly onto the structural wall if no membrane is present.

2. **Portugal's driving rain exceeds what most cladding joints can resist indefinitely.**
   The LNEC wind rose data for Porto and Lisbon shows sustained driving rain events of 30-60 minutes with intensities equivalent to 150-450 Pa wind-water differential — the range in which even well-maintained sealed joints experience breakthrough.

3. **The cost of remediating water-damaged insulation and structural elements far exceeds the cost of the membrane.**
   A saturated EPS insulation board in an ETICS system has near-zero thermal resistance. Replacing wet insulation behind a cladding system means removing and reinstalling the entire cladding assembly. The EPDM membrane that could have prevented this costs a fraction of the remediation.

4. **Building regulations and standards are moving toward mandatory WRB layers.**
   The evolution of EN 13859-2 and its implementation in CE-marked products reflects European consensus that secondary water-control layers are a design requirement, not a best practice. Membriko specifies to current regulatory standard, not historic minimum.

## Section 3: Why EPDM for Facades

**Purpose:** Technical authority on material selection. This section should answer "why EPDM and not a house wrap or bituminous sheet" with engineering precision.

**Content:**

Four key material advantages over the competing facade membrane options:

1. **UV resistance without time limit**
   House wraps (spunbonded PP/PE) degrade under UV exposure — most are rated for 3 to 6 months of exposed installation before cladding must be applied. EPDM's UV resistance is intrinsic to its saturated polymer backbone: no degradation after 5,000+ hours of UV exposure in EN 1297 testing. This is particularly important for facades with open-jointed cladding where the membrane receives ongoing UV exposure through the joint gaps for the life of the building.

2. **Elongation to bridge structural cracks**
   EPDM elongates 300-400% before failure. A 1 mm crack in a concrete structural wall bridged by a 1.0 mm EPDM membrane imposes a strain of approximately 50% on the membrane over a 2 mm bonded zone on either side. This is well within the elastic range of EPDM. A house wrap would tear. A bituminous sheet would crack at the same location within 5-10 years of thermal cycling.

3. **Cold-weather flexibility**
   Portugal's winter temperatures in the interior reach -5°C to -10°C at wall surface levels. Many bituminous and thermoplastic membranes lose flexibility and crack when bent around window corners or pipe penetrations at these temperatures. EPDM retains full flexibility to -45°C — installation and service performance are identical in winter and summer.

4. **Compatibility with all facade substrate types**
   EPDM adheres to reinforced concrete, lightweight concrete block, brick, existing render (if sound), steel substrate (with appropriate primer), and timber frame (mechanically fastened). It is chemically neutral — no migration of plasticisers or solvents that could affect adjacent materials. The same product serves every substrate type; the installation method adapts.

## Section 4: Four Facade System Types

**Purpose:** Show technical breadth. Not all facades are the same; Membriko understands every configuration.

**Content:** Four cards, each with system name, how EPDM is used, specific requirements, and the key design consideration.

1. **Rainscreen / Ventilated Facade (Fachada Ventilada)**
   - EPDM mechanically fastened to structural wall; ventilated cavity of minimum 20-40 mm; exterior cladding panel suspended on aluminium or steel subframe
   - EPDM functions as: secondary waterproofing + drainage plane + partial air barrier
   - Key requirement: lap direction (shingled — upper over lower); open-bottom drainage at base of cavity; sealed integration with window surrounds
   - Design consideration: the cavity must be vented at top and bottom for convective drying; EPDM airtightness is beneficial for thermal performance but cavity design governs ventilation rate

2. **ETICS / EIFS Backup Membrane**
   - EPDM bonded to structural wall before insulation board adhesion; insulation fixed over EPDM; render applied to insulation
   - EPDM functions as: secondary waterproofing + substrate bridging for crack management
   - Key requirement: compatible adhesive for insulation board over EPDM surface; EPDM must be appropriate thickness for render loading (1.0 mm minimum)
   - Design consideration: vapour control — in most Portuguese climates, the moisture flow is from interior to exterior in winter, making a relatively vapour-open EPDM preferable to fully vapour-closed; discuss with Membriko for site-specific analysis

3. **Curtain Wall / Structural Glazing Backup**
   - EPDM applied to spandrel zone (floor slab edge and structural slab above window) behind curtain wall panels or at window-to-slab interfaces
   - EPDM functions as: secondary waterproofing behind spandrel panels; integration with curtain wall drainage channels
   - Key requirement: integration with curtain wall sill drainage flanges; continuity across structural joints; compatible with curtain wall system sealants
   - Design consideration: high-rise applications require fall arrest provisions during EPDM installation; wind loading at height must be assessed for mechanically fastened systems

4. **Facade Rehabilitation — Over Existing Render**
   - EPDM installed over existing render (if structurally sound and adherent) or over cleaned and repaired structural masonry (if render removed)
   - EPDM functions as: new secondary waterproofing layer eliminating infiltrations through cracked or failed render; substrate for new cladding system
   - Key requirement: existing render pull-off test before installation; treatment of active cracks before membrane installation; edge terminations at existing window frames and sills
   - Design consideration: added thickness of EPDM plus any new cladding must be accommodated at window reveals and sill projections — often requires extended sill nosings or reveal liners

---

## Section 5: Air and Water Barrier Functions

**Purpose:** Technical differentiation — Membriko understands facade science, not just membrane installation.

**Content:**

Explain the two functions and why both matter:

**Water barrier (primary function):**
The EPDM membrane stops liquid water in all forms — driving rain forced through joints, capillary moisture drawn through masonry, and runoff from window sills or horizontal features above — from reaching the structural wall, insulation, and interior. This is a binary performance requirement: either the membrane is watertight, or it is not. EPDM is unconditionally watertight under hydrostatic pressure and driving rain loads within the EN 13859-2 performance envelope.

**Air barrier (secondary function):**
Uncontrolled air movement through the facade assembly wastes heating and cooling energy and can carry moisture (vapour) into the assembly where it condenses. When EPDM laps are sealed with appropriate seam tape and penetrations are detail-sealed at pipe and window surrounds, the membrane assembly functions as a continuous air barrier. This contributes directly to the building's air permeability performance under EN 13829 blower-door testing, which is increasingly required for BREEAM, PassivHaus, and premium residential projects in Portugal.

Quantitative reference: reducing air permeability from 10 m³/h·m² (typical uncontrolled Portuguese residential construction) to 3 m³/h·m² (good practice) reduces space heating demand by approximately 15-25% in a typical mid-rise apartment block.

## Section 6: Installation Process

**Purpose:** Demonstrate systematic competence; reduce buyer anxiety about a complex application.

**Content:** Six steps for a facade membrane project, matching the flat-roofs page format.

1. **Technical Assessment and Survey** — Facade geometry survey, existing surface condition assessment (pull-off test, crack mapping, moisture reading), system definition, window and penetration inventory
2. **System Design and Documentation** — Written specification, product selection (membrane type, fixings, seam tape, detailing accessories), integration design with curtain wall or cladding subcontractor
3. **Substrate Preparation** — Surface cleaning, crack repair with compatible sealant or mortar, primer application for bonded systems, temporary weather protection during works
4. **Membrane Installation** — Roll-out and fixing (mechanical or bonded), lap sealing, progressive quality check as each bay is completed
5. **Detail Sealing** — Window surrounds, pipe penetrations, sill junctions, parapet interfaces — all treated with pre-formed EPDM accessories or formed site details using seam tape
6. **Inspection, Testing, and Warranty** — Water hose test per AAMA 501.2 or equivalent at all window perimeters; visual inspection of all laps; warranty certificate issue

---

## Section 7: Detailing — Window and Door Openings, Corners, Penetrations

**Purpose:** Address the specific failure locations that cause virtually all facade membrane infiltrations.

**Content:** Three critical detail zones presented as an accordion or illustrated guide.

**Window and door openings (the #1 failure location)**
- The junction between the window frame and the surrounding facade must be waterproof in three dimensions: the sill (horizontal, with outward drainage slope), the jambs (vertical, integrated with laps of vertical membrane runs), and the head (horizontal, with lap directing water over frame, not behind it)
- Membriko uses pre-formed EPDM flexible sill trays and jamb tape extensions at all openings; never mastic alone at this junction
- Design rule: the EPDM sill tray must project beyond the face of the cladding by the full overhang dimension so that water draining off the cladding surface cannot re-enter the gap at the sill nose

**Corners (internal and external)**
- External corners of buildings (arrises between two facade planes) subject the membrane to bi-directional tension under thermal movement; house wraps often tear or delaminate at external corners
- Membriko uses EPDM corner flashings — cut from flat stock or supplied as pre-formed pieces — bonded with seam tape to the field membrane; the geometry allows thermal movement in both facade planes without stressing the corner detail
- Internal corners (at reveals, recesses, and return walls) are treated with a continuous tape-sealed folded detail, not a mastic sealant

**Penetrations (pipes, cables, ventilation outlets)**
- All penetrations through the facade membrane are treated with EPDM pipe boots (pre-formed, factory-vulcanised, sized to pipe diameter) sealed to the field membrane with seam tape and primer; no exposed mastic at any penetration through the membrane field
- Ventilation outlets and electrical conduit penetrations use square/rectangular EPDM flashing collars where pre-formed pipe boots are not appropriate
- All penetrations are inspected and water-hose tested individually before cladding is installed

## Section 8: EPDM vs Liquid, Self-Adhered, and Bituminous Alternatives

**Purpose:** Handle the "what about the other options" objection directly.

**Content:** Comparison table plus two paragraphs of honest commentary.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | PP/PE House Wrap | Self-Adhered Bituminous | Liquid PU Membrane |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UV resistance (permanent) | Intrinsic — unlimited | 3-6 months max | 5-10 years | 5-15 years |
| Elongation at break | 300-400% | 15-30% | 50-100% | 200-400% |
| Cold-temperature flexibility | -45°C (full) | -20°C (limited) | -5°C to 0°C | -10°C to -20°C |
| Application in complex geometry | Excellent (tape + pre-forms) | Limited (tears at fixings) | Good (self-adhere) | Excellent (brush/spray) |
| Service life | 50+ years | 15-25 years | 20-25 years | 10-20 years |
| Substrate crack bridging | Excellent (400% elongation) | None | Limited | Good |
| Substrate bonding | Adhesive or mechanical | Mechanical only | Self-adhered | Full bond |
| Recoating required | Never | No | No | Every 10-20 years |
| EN 13859-2 compliance | Yes (sheet product standard) | Yes | Yes | Via ETA |

Honest commentary: PP/PE house wraps are appropriate for timber-frame construction with short exposure windows and straightforward geometry — they are lightweight, cheap, and vapour-open. They are not appropriate where permanent UV exposure through open joints occurs, where complex detailing around concrete or masonry substrates is required, or where high elongation for crack-bridging is needed. Liquid PU membranes have advantages in complex retrofit geometry; their limitation is the recoating requirement and the sensitivity of application quality to surface preparation on vertical substrates.

---

## Section 9: Breathability and Vapour Management

**Purpose:** Address the most common technical misconception about facade membranes — that being watertight and being vapour-permeable are mutually exclusive requirements.

**Content:**

Explain in plain language (accessible to building owners, not just engineers):
- Water in liquid form and water vapour are different physical phenomena requiring different design responses
- A membrane can be watertight (stops liquid water) while allowing vapour to diffuse through it slowly (vapour-permeable) — house wraps are the familiar example
- Standard EPDM is watertight and relatively vapour-tight (Sd 15-30 m for 1.0 mm thickness)

When vapour-tightness of the facade membrane is not a problem:
- Ventilated facade assemblies: cavity air carries away any vapour that diffuses through the wall
- When EPDM is used as a vapour control layer on the warm side (inside face) of wall insulation

When vapour-open performance is preferred:
- ETICS applications on concrete or masonry walls in moderate climates where outward drying is needed
- Solution: specialist vapour-open EPDM formulations with enhanced permeability (Sd 0.5-5 m), or design the assembly so the vapour control layer is positioned on the warm side (interior surface) with a vapour-open facade membrane on the cold side

Membriko's technical advice includes a vapour analysis as part of every facade project specification — not an assumption that standard EPDM is always right.

## Section 10: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Satisfy the specifier audience's need for precise data in a scannable format.

**Content:** Two tables.

**Table 1: Product Performance (per EN 13859-2)**
| Property | 1.0 mm EPDM | 1.5 mm EPDM | Test Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 30 N/mm | ≥ 40 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |

| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | -45°C to +150°C | — |

**Table 2: System Coverage (typical per installation method)**
| Method | Application | Fixing Spacing | Seam Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mechanical — ventilated facade | 1.0 mm EPDM on masonry/concrete wall | 300-600 mm c/c at laps | Taped or untaped lap (min 100 mm) |
| Bonded — ETICS backup | 1.0 mm EPDM on concrete/render | Continuous — full adhesive | Taped lap (min 100 mm) |
| Mechanical — curtain wall backup | 1.5 mm EPDM on slab edge and spandrel | 200-400 mm c/c | Taped lap with primer |
| Bonded — over existing render | 1.0 mm EPDM on cleaned render | Continuous bonded + perimeter mechanical | Taped and sealed lap |

## Section 11: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Reassure buyers that EPDM behind cladding is genuinely maintenance-free, unlike sealant-based systems.

**Content:**

Short section — three points:
1. The EPDM membrane behind a cladding system requires no maintenance for its service life. It has no components that degrade (no plasticisers, no UV-sensitive surface, no oxidising bitumen). Membrane condition checks are needed only if physical damage (construction impact, penetration by subsequent trades) is suspected.
2. The detail components that do require periodic inspection are the sealants at window frame perimeters (if silicone-sealed, not EPDM-detailed), any exposed flashing terminations at copings, and drainage outlets at the base of ventilated cavities.
3. Where Membriko has detailed window perimeters with EPDM sill trays and EPDM jamb flashings rather than silicone sealant, no sealant replacement is required. This is the long-term maintenance cost advantage of comprehensive EPDM detailing over sealant-dependent systems.

## Section 12: Portuguese Facade Failures — The ETICS Problem

**Purpose:** Portugal-specific credibility. Show we know the local market's specific failure history.

**Content:**

Narrative section covering:
- The ETICS boom in Portugal in the 1990s and early 2000s: millions of square metres of capoto applied to residential and commercial buildings, often without adequate detailing at window junctions, parapets, and base of wall
- The 20-30 year ageing now manifesting as infiltrations at window perimeters, delaminating insulation boards, biological growth on render surfaces, and structural damage to the concrete frame from chronic moisture
- The LNEC studies and building pathology records documenting the scale of the problem
- Membriko's rehabilitation EPDM programme: assessment, ETICS removal or overlay, EPDM installation, re-ETICS or new ventilated facade

Specific failure points for Portuguese ETICS:
1. Window perimeter sealant failure (most common)
2. Inadequate mechanical fixings — capoto delamination from substrate
3. Parapet detailing — water entry over coping into top of ETICS
4. Base of wall — wicking from ground splash, inadequate drip detail
5. Balcony soffit junctions — water tracking from above onto ETICS substrate

---

## Section 13: Regulatory Framework (EN 13859-2)

**Purpose:** Compliance confidence for public sector and specified projects.

**Content:**

European Level:
- EN 13859-2: Flexible sheets for waterproofing — underlays for walls. Governs flexible sheet products used as secondary water-shedding layers in facade assemblies. CE marking mandatory under CPR.
- EN 13830: Curtain walling — product standard; references water penetration resistance and drainage design
- EN 15026: Hygrothermal performance of building components — used for vapour analysis

Portuguese / National Level:
- REH (DL 118/2013): Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Habitação — sets U-value maxima for opaque facade elements; air permeability affects energy class
- RCCTE (DL 80/2006, partially replaced by REH): historical reference for thermal performance calculations
- RGEU: No specific facade membrane requirement, but implies weathertightness of all exterior elements
- LNEC Documentos de Aplicação: May be required for specific products or systems in public sector projects

---

## Section 14: Energy Performance Integration

**Purpose:** Show the thermal performance angle — EPDM is not just waterproofing, it contributes to energy efficiency.

**Content:**

Two angles:

**Airtightness contribution:**
When EPDM is installed as a continuous, lap-sealed layer, it contributes to the building's air barrier continuity. For REH energy class A or A+, air permeability (q50) must be below 2-3 m³/h·m². An EPDM facade membrane with sealed laps contributes to achieving this without additional dedicated air barrier products. This eliminates one product layer and the associated installation cost in high-performance facade designs.

**Thermal bridge prevention:**
Mechanical fixings through insulation layers are a source of thermal bridges — each fastener conducts heat from the interior to the exterior. Membriko's specification of thermal break fastener systems (fasteners with insulated sleeves or caps) and the correct positioning of fixings in relation to the insulation layer avoids creating localised cold bridges that reduce effective U-values and create condensation risk points.

## FAQ: 8 Questions

**Purpose:** Long-tail search capture; reduce pre-sale technical queries.

1. **O que é uma membrana pára-chuva e por que preciso de uma na fachada?**
   A rain barrier membrane is a continuous watertight layer installed between the structural wall and the exterior cladding. Its purpose is to stop any water that penetrates the primary cladding — through joints, cracks, or detailing failures — from reaching the structural elements, thermal insulation, or interior. In Portugal's driving rain climate, a cladding system without a behind-cladding membrane provides no safety margin when joints deteriorate or cladding is damaged.

2. **O EPDM pode ser instalado diretamente sobre reboco existente sem o remover?**
   Yes, in most rehabilitation cases. If the existing render has a pull-off strength above 0.08 N/mm² (tested with a portable adhesion tester per EN 1542), is free of delaminating areas, and has no active structural cracks larger than 3 mm, the EPDM can be installed over it. Active cracks are treated with flexible EPDM tape before membrane installation. This avoids the cost and waste of full render removal.

3. **Qual a diferença entre EPDM para fachada e tela betuminosa autocolante?**
   Both are secondary water-control membranes. The critical differences are: EPDM has intrinsic UV resistance (no degradation in open-joint cladding exposure) while self-adhered bituminous sheets become brittle under UV within 5-10 years; EPDM elongates 300-400% to bridge structural cracks while bituminous sheets elongate 50-100%; and EPDM service life exceeds 50 years while bituminous underlays are typically rated at 20-25 years. For complex detailing (window reveals, pipe penetrations), EPDM accessories are more versatile.

4. **Como funciona a membrana EPDM numa fachada ventilada?**
   In a ventilated facade system, EPDM is mechanically fixed to the structural wall with fasteners through the membrane at lap zones. The ventilated air cavity (minimum 20 mm, typically 40-80 mm) sits between the EPDM face and the back of the cladding panel. Rain that penetrates the open or semi-open joints between cladding panels falls onto the EPDM surface and drains downward (by gravity, as the EPDM is vertical) to the base of the cavity, where it exits through open drainage slots above the base flashing. The EPDM never accumulates water — it drains it harmlessly away.

5. **O EPDM em fachada precisa de manutenção?**
   No. The EPDM membrane itself, once installed behind cladding, requires no maintenance for its service life. Unlike silicone sealants at window joints — which must be inspected every 5-10 years and replaced when they crack or lose adhesion — the EPDM membrane does not degrade, crack, or lose adhesion with age. Where Membriko uses EPDM detailing at window perimeters and parapets (rather than sealant), these details are also maintenance-free. The only maintenance activities are cleaning ventilation slots at the base of cavities (to prevent debris blockage) and inspecting any exposed metal flashings for mechanical damage.

6. **Quanto tempo demora a instalar membrana EPDM numa fachada?**
   Installation rate depends on facade complexity. A straightforward rectangular facade with few penetrations: approximately 150-200 m² per day for a two-person crew. Complex facades with multiple window openings, balconies, and pipe penetrations: 60-100 m² per day due to the time required for detailed junction work. Membriko provides a programme timeline with every proposal based on the specific facade geometry.

7. **O EPDM é compatível com estruturas de suporte de alumínio da fachada ventilada?**
   Yes, EPDM is chemically neutral and compatible with aluminium alloy, galvanised steel, stainless steel, and composite facade support systems. Fasteners for mechanical fixing of EPDM to masonry or concrete substrates must be stainless steel or hot-dip galvanised to avoid electrochemical corrosion at the fixing point. Membriko specifies fastener type and material based on the substrate and the support system being installed over the membrane.

8. **A Membriko oferece garantia para impermeabilização de fachada?**
   Membriko issues a 15-year installation warranty for facade membrane systems. This covers workmanship: watertightness of the membrane installation, seam integrity, and detail sealing at penetrations and junctions. The warranty is supported by a post-installation water hose test record. For high-value commercial projects, Membriko can coordinate manufacturer warranty on the membrane product itself — extending material coverage for up to 20 years — in addition to the installation warranty.
