# Facade Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Introduction: The Facade as the Building's Immune System

The facade is the boundary between the exterior world and the inhabited interior. It is the first line of defence against rain, wind, cold, and heat — and it is simultaneously one of the most technically complex and most frequently under-specified elements in Portuguese construction. When a facade fails, the failure is neither immediate nor dramatic: it is silent, progressive, and devastatingly expensive by the time it becomes visible.

Membriko installs EPDM membrane for facade waterproofing because the technical evidence is unequivocal: no other material available in the Portuguese market combines intrinsic UV resistance, 300 to 400% elongation, Class A driving rain resistance, and a proven 50+ year service life in a single solution that can be installed behind any exterior cladding system. This is not a commercial position — it is an engineering conclusion.

Portugal has one of the highest driving rain intensities on the Western European Atlantic seaboard. Northwest-facing facades in Porto, Viana do Castelo, and Braga, and west-facing elevations along the entire Atlantic coast, are subject to driving rain intensities in Class 3 and Class 4 of EN ISO 15927-3 — wind-water pressure differentials of 150 to 600 Pa that force water through any joint or crack that is not sealed in an absolutely robust and durable manner. The Mediterranean climate of the south brings the opposite problem: intense UV radiation that degrades organic sealants within 5 to 10 years, leaving joints open and unprotected.

Membriko is based in Pombal, at the geographical heart of Portugal, with the capacity to work across the entire national territory. We have delivered EPDM facade membrane installations across the full range of facade typologies: ventilated facades on new-build residential and office buildings, external insulation composite system (ETICS) rehabilitation, curtain wall backup on large commercial buildings, and rehabilitation of facades with active water ingress. In all of these contexts, EPDM has demonstrated that it eliminates the problem permanently — without periodic maintenance, without sealant replacement, without repeat interventions.

## Why a Behind-Cladding Membrane Is Not Optional

The most common error made by a specifier or developer regarding facade waterproofing is assuming that the exterior cladding is, in itself, the waterproofing. This assumption is incorrect for every cladding system used in Portugal.

### No Cladding System Remains Watertight at Every Joint Over the Building's Life

A ceramic tile cladding with mortar joints is watertight on the day it is completed. Five years later, carbonation of the mortar, differential shrinkage between the tiles and the substrate, and accumulated thermal cycling have begun to create micro-cracks in the joints. Fifteen years later, cracks are visible to the naked eye and water enters by capillarity. Thirty years later, the damage to the structure and insulation behind may be catastrophic.

Natural stone, face brick, render — every one of these systems follows the same ageing pattern: progressive deterioration of watertightness over decades, with joints and junctions at window and door openings as the preferred water entry routes.

### Portugal's Driving Rain Exceeds What Facade Joints Can Resist Indefinitely

LNEC wind-rose and precipitation intensity data for Porto and Lisbon show driving rain events of 30 to 90 minutes with wind-water pressure equivalents of 150 to 450 Pa — the range in which even well-maintained sealed joints experience water breakthrough. A 3 mm mortar joint with typical shrinkage cracks does not resist pressures of this magnitude indefinitely. The EPDM membrane behind the cladding is the second line of defence that ensures even when the joint fails, water cannot reach the structure.

### The Cost of Remediation Far Exceeds the Cost of the Membrane

A facade ETICS system with active infiltrations at window sill and frame perimeters requires remediation that includes: removal of the cladding panel or reinforced render in the affected zone, removal and replacement of saturated insulation, treatment of the reinforced concrete structure for any signs of reinforcement corrosion, and reinstallation of the entire cladding system. This cost can reach twice the cost of the original installation. The EPDM membrane installed on the structural wall before the ETICS costs a fraction of this and eliminates the risk permanently.

### European Regulation Is Moving Towards Mandatory Water-Control Membrane Layers

The evolution of EN 13859-2 (Flexible sheets for waterproofing — definitions and characteristics of underlays for walls) and its implementation in CE-marked products reflects European consensus that secondary water-control layers in facades are a design requirement, not an optional best practice. Membriko specifies to the current regulatory standard.

## Why EPDM for Facades

Membriko specifies EPDM for facade waterproofing on the basis of four technical advantages that no alternative product combines simultaneously.

### UV Resistance Without Time Limit

Polypropylene or polyethylene spunbonded house wraps — the principal competing products in the facade membrane market for lightweight construction — degrade under UV exposure. Most are rated for a maximum of 3 to 6 months of exposure before the exterior cladding must be installed. In facades with open-jointed cladding — where the membrane receives direct solar radiation through the panel gaps — this limitation makes house wraps technically inappropriate.

EPDM has no UV exposure limit. Its UV resistance is not conferred by a UV stabiliser additive that depletes over time: it is intrinsic to the molecular architecture of the polymer. The main chain of the ethylene-propylene copolymer is chemically saturated — it has no C=C double bonds vulnerable to photochemical attack by ozone or UV-induced photooxidation. After 5,000 hours of accelerated UV exposure in EN 1297 testing, EPDM membranes show no cracking, colour change, or loss of mechanical properties. This is the decisive property for facades with open-jointed cladding, where the membrane will be exposed to UV throughout the life of the building.

### Elongation to Bridge Structural Cracks

Membriko installs EPDM with an elongation at break of 300 to 400%. When a 1 mm crack in a concrete substrate is bridged by a 1.0 mm EPDM membrane bonded to both margins of the crack, the strain imposed on the membrane over a 2 mm bonding zone on each side is approximately 50%. This deformation is well within the elastic range of EPDM — the membrane accommodates the crack without residual stress, without cracking, and without loss of watertightness.

A polypropylene house wrap with 15 to 30% elongation tears at this location. A self-adhered bituminous sheet with 50 to 100% elongation may accommodate the initial crack but, after several years of thermal cycling that opens and closes the crack repeatedly, the bituminous material accumulates permanent deformation and cracks. EPDM does not accumulate permanent deformation — its elastic memory is maintained indefinitely by the vulcanised cross-link network.

### Cold-Weather Flexibility

Facade surface temperatures in the interior of Portugal can reach -5°C to -10°C on winter nights in Trás-os-Montes, the Beira Interior, and the Alentejo plateau. Many bituminous and thermoplastic materials lose flexibility at these temperatures and crack when folded around window corners or pipe penetrations during installation or when subjected to thermal movements of the building in service.

EPDM retains full flexibility to -45°C. The glass transition temperature of EPDM lies between -60°C and -50°C — far below any ambient or surface temperature recorded in Portugal. Installation and in-service performance are identical in summer and winter, on the coast and in the interior, in the cold northern zones and the hot southern zones. This consistency of behaviour is a fundamental differentiator for a contractor working across the entire national territory like Membriko.

### Compatibility with All Facade Substrate Types

EPDM bonds to reinforced concrete, lightweight concrete block, brick, existing render (if structurally sound), and can be mechanically fixed to any substrate. It is chemically neutral — it does not migrate plasticisers or solvents that could affect adjacent materials, whether ETICS insulation, ventilated facade support profiles, or window frames. Membriko uses the same membrane product across all substrate types; the installation method adapts to the specific conditions of each project.

## Four Facade System Types and EPDM Application

Membriko works with four distinct facade configurations. Each places specific demands on the membrane — in terms of installation method, product specification, and detailing at transition zones.

### Ventilated Facade (Rainscreen)

The ventilated facade is the highest-performance facade system available in contemporary construction. The operating principle is based on pressure equalisation between the exterior face of the cladding panel and the air cavity behind it: when the pressure between the exterior and the cavity is equal, there is no pressure differential to drive water through the panel joints, and suction-driven water penetration is eliminated.

The system explicitly assumes that some water will enter the cavity through the open or semi-open joints between panels — and the EPDM membrane on the structural wall behind the cavity is the element that prevents this water from reaching the structure. EPDM performs three simultaneous functions: secondary waterproofing (prevents water from reaching the structural wall), drainage plane (channels water that enters the cavity downward by gravity), and partial air barrier (reduces uncontrolled air movement through the wall, improving thermal performance).

Membriko mechanically fixes the EPDM membrane to the structural wall with stainless steel or hot-dip galvanised fasteners at 300-600 mm centres in the lap zones. The minimum lap between sheets is 100 mm, with the upper sheet lapping over the lower sheet — the shingled lap — ensuring that water in the cavity drains by gravity without entering through the lap. The ventilated air cavity has a minimum dimension of 20 mm (ideally 40-80 mm) and is open at top and bottom for convective ventilation that removes residual moisture.

Integration with window and door openings, sills, and balconies is achieved using pre-formed or site-formed EPDM accessories — detailed in a separate section below.

### ETICS Backup Membrane

The external thermal insulation composite system — known in Portugal as capoto — bonds insulation boards directly to the structural wall with adhesive mortar, covers them with glass fibre mesh embedded in base coat render, and finishes with a mineral or synthetic render. There is no ventilated cavity — the render is the exposed surface, and water management relies on render surface integrity and the performance of sealants at junctions and penetrations.

Membriko installs EPDM membrane as a preliminary water-control layer applied to the structural wall before the insulation boards are bonded. This approach is standard in rehabilitation projects where the existing render is cracked, carbonated, or insufficiently adherent to serve as a clean substrate for the ETICS adhesive, but where full render removal would be disproportionately expensive. The EPDM membrane bridges existing cracks, provides a clean bonding surface for the ETICS adhesive, and ensures that any residual moisture migration from the old render is captured before it can wet the new insulation.

On new-build projects, Membriko specifies EPDM as a precautionary measure on high-exposure facades — typically those with complex geometry, multiple balcony projections, or canopied areas where render continuity is difficult to maintain and point defects are foreseeable.

### Curtain Wall and Structural Glazing Backup

Curtain wall systems — unitised or stick-built aluminium framing with glass or opaque infill panels — are nominally designed to be watertight at the frame joints. In practice, EN 13830 accepts water penetration into internal drainage channels, with the requirement being that this water is channelled to the exterior without reaching the interior. When drainage channels are blocked, incorrectly sloped, or damaged, water migrates to the back of the system and reaches the spandrel zone — the area between vision glass panels that conceals the floor slab edge and the ceiling of the floor below.

Membriko applies EPDM membranes to the spandrel zone (floor slab edge and structural slab above the window opening) behind curtain wall panels, particularly in retrofit situations where the original spandrel waterproofing has degraded, or in new construction on high-risk facades (high-rise buildings, north-facing elevations in high driving-rain zones). The EPDM integrates with the curtain wall drainage channels and with the perimeter seals of the window units.

### Facade Rehabilitation Over Existing Render

The rehabilitation of facades with active water ingress is one of the highest-volume segments in Membriko's project portfolio. In many cases — particularly in the Portuguese residential building stock constructed between the 1970s and early 2000s — the source of infiltrations is the degradation of the exterior render or the sealants at window openings, not a structural wall failure.

Membriko assesses the existing render with pull-off adhesion testing (EN 1542) — the minimum requirement is a pull-off resistance above 0.08 N/mm². If the render passes this test and shows no widespread delamination, EPDM can be installed directly over it after cleaning and treatment of any active cracks. This approach eliminates the cost and waste of full render removal and can reduce the total project cost by 20 to 35%.

After EPDM installation over existing render, the system is completed with a new cladding: a full ETICS system (new insulation boards and reinforced render), a ventilated facade system with new subframe and panels, or, in simpler cases, a reinforced render with glass fibre mesh directly over the EPDM. The additional thickness of the EPDM plus the new cladding must be accommodated at window sills, reveals, and copings — Membriko includes this detail resolution in the design stage of every installation.

## Air and Water Barrier Functions

The facade water-control membrane, when correctly installed, performs two distinct functions that complement each other: water barrier and air barrier.

### Water Barrier (Primary Function)

EPDM stops liquid water in all its forms of aggression: driving rain forced by wind pressure differential through cladding joints, capillary moisture rising through masonry, run-off from sills and upper horizontal elements, and surface condensation from damp cold air contacting the wall surface. This is a binary function: either the membrane is watertight, or it is not. EPDM installed by Membriko is unconditionally watertight under hydrostatic load and driving rain loading within the EN 13859-2 Class A performance envelope.

Membriko verifies watertightness after installation using a water hose spray test (AAMA 501.2 or equivalent) at all window perimeters and critical transition points. No warranty certificate is issued before this test is completed and documented.

### Air Barrier (Secondary Function)

Uncontrolled air movement through the facade assembly has two negative effects: direct energy loss through convection (warm interior air escaping through gaps and joints) and wind-washing of thermal insulation (cold exterior air moving through the insulation layer, dramatically reducing its effective thermal resistance).

When EPDM laps are sealed with compatible seam tape and penetrations are detailed with EPDM accessories, the membrane functions as a continuous air barrier. This contributes directly to the building's air permeability performance, measured by blower-door testing (EN 13829), which is increasingly required for projects targeting energy class A or A+ under the Portuguese REH regulation.

Quantitative reference: reducing air permeability from 10 m³/h·m² (typical Portuguese construction without air control) to 3 m³/h·m² (good practice) reduces space heating energy demand by 15 to 25% in a typical multi-storey residential building.

## Installation Process: Six Stages

Membriko follows the same structured process on every facade membrane project. This process is not a marketing framework — it is the operational sequence that produces a consistently documented, verifiable, and warrantable result.

### Stage 1: Technical Assessment and Survey

The process begins with a free site visit by a Membriko technical representative. This is not a sales visit: it is a structured engineering assessment. Measurement and photographic documentation of the facade geometry, orientations, number and position of openings, penetrations, and horizontal elements (balconies, sills, canopies, copings). Inspection of the existing surface condition including pull-off testing where indicated. Identification of all singular points and of any existing failure modes. Assessment of the existing or proposed cladding system. The output is a written technical report with photographic documentation.

### Stage 2: System Design and Documentation

Membriko produces a written specification for every project: membrane product selected, installation method, fastener type and spacing, lap type (sealed or unsealed), and detail accessories for each type of singular point. This specification accompanies the price proposal and is the reference document during execution and for warranty issuance.

### Stage 3: Substrate Preparation

No membrane performs better than the substrate it is installed on. Membriko's substrate preparation includes: removal of all debris, vegetation, and loose coatings; grinding or levelling of surface protrusions on concrete substrates that would create stress concentrations in the membrane; repair of active cracks with compatible sealant or levelling mortar; application of a bonding primer to concrete surfaces for bonded installations; and moisture content verification before any bonded membrane installation (a damp substrate compromises bond strength).

### Stage 4: Membrane Installation

Depending on the method selected, installation involves: (a) ventilated facade — mechanical fixing of EPDM rolls to the wall with fasteners at calculated centres in the minimum 100 mm lap zones; (b) bonded system (ETICS backup or rehabilitation) — contact adhesive application to both EPDM and substrate, controlled open time, bonding; (c) curtain wall backup — mechanical fixing or bonding in accordance with the specific design detail. Laps between sheets are inspected progressively as each membrane panel is placed.

### Stage 5: Detailing of Singular Points

This is the most technically demanding stage and the most critical for long-term watertightness. Every window and door perimeter, sill, balcony junction, pipe and cable penetration, and coping termination is treated with pre-formed EPDM accessories or site-formed details using seam tape and primer. Membriko does not use silicone sealant as the primary watertightness element for any detail — silicone is used only as a cosmetic finishing element where geometry requires it, and never as a structural sealing element.

### Stage 6: Inspection, Testing, and Warranty

Before any Membriko installation is considered complete, every linear metre of lap, every transition detail, and every penetration is inspected by a senior technician. A water hose spray test is conducted at all window perimeters. Membriko issues a 15-year installation warranty certificate for facades, supported by a photographic record of the post-installation watertightness test.

---

## Detailing: Window and Door Openings, Corners, Penetrations

Singular points are responsible for more than 80% of facade infiltrations — despite representing less than 5% of the total facade area. Membriko treats every singular point with the same attention it gives to the field membrane.

### Window and Door Openings (the Most Frequent Failure Location)

The junction between the window frame and the surrounding facade is the most technically demanding point in any facade membrane installation. It requires watertightness in three dimensions: the sill (horizontal, with outward drainage slope), the jambs (vertical, integrated with the laps of the vertical membrane runs), and the head (horizontal, with the membrane lapping over the top of the frame, never behind or below it).

Membriko uses pre-formed EPDM flexible sill trays and jamb tape extensions at all openings. Silicone sealant is never the sole waterproofing element at this junction. The design rule is that the EPDM sill tray must project beyond the face of the exterior cladding by the full sill overhang dimension, so that water draining off the cladding surface cannot re-enter the gap at the sill nose.

### External and Internal Corners

External building corners — the arrises between two facade planes — subject the membrane to bi-directional tension under thermal movement: expansion and contraction of the two facade planes act simultaneously on the same membrane zone. House wraps frequently tear or delaminate at external corners. Membriko uses EPDM corner flashings — either cut from flat stock or supplied as pre-formed pieces — bonded with seam tape to the field membrane. The geometry accommodates thermal movement in both facade planes without stressing the corner detail.

Internal corners at reveals, recesses, and return walls are treated with a continuous folded and tape-sealed detail, not a sealant bead.

### Pipe and Cable Penetrations

All penetrations through the facade membrane by pipes, cables, or ventilation grilles are treated with pre-formed EPDM pipe boots (factory-vulcanised, sized to the pipe diameter) sealed to the field membrane with seam tape and compatible primer. Ventilation outlet and electrical conduit penetrations use square or rectangular EPDM flashing collars where pre-formed pipe boots are not appropriate. Membriko does not use construction silicone as the primary seal at any penetration through the membrane field — silicone does not tolerate the differential deformation between the membrane and the pipe over decades of service.

---

## EPDM vs Liquid, Self-Adhered, and Bituminous Alternatives

The choice of facade membrane has consequences for the next several decades. Membriko presents the comparison objectively.

### EPDM vs PP/PE House Wraps

Polypropylene or polyethylene house wraps are the dominant product in the facade membrane market for lightweight timber-frame construction in Northern Europe and North America. They offer high vapour permeability (Sd values of 0.02 to 0.5 m), which is advantageous for moisture management in ETICS applications. However, their limitations for the Portuguese context are decisive:

- Tensile strength of 200-400 N/50 mm vs EPDM at 9-12 N/mm² — orders of magnitude difference
- UV degradation limits exposure time before exterior cladding is installed (typically 3 to 6 months maximum); unsuitable for open-jointed cladding with permanent UV exposure
- Cannot bridge structural cracks — elongation of 15 to 30% vs 300 to 400% for EPDM
- Tear at mechanical fixing points; fasteners create potential water penetration holes

For construction in concrete or masonry in Portugal, Membriko does not specify house wraps as the primary facade membrane.

### EPDM vs Self-Adhered Bituminous Membranes

Self-adhered bituminous membranes (SBS-modified, cold-applied) are widely used as sill and window perimeter flashings in quality construction. They are not typically used as full-facade field membranes, but they are the dominant product for sealing window openings.

The decisive limitation relative to EPDM: bituminous membranes at window perimeters receive direct solar radiation in the gap between frame and cladding, where they may receive UV exposure for years. SBS bitumen under UV exposure in Portuguese conditions becomes brittle and cracked within 5 to 10 years. EPDM does not degrade under permanent UV exposure — a critical advantage for head and sill details that are chronically exposed.

### EPDM vs Liquid PU Membranes

Liquid-applied polyurethane or acrylic membranes can form an integral waterproofing layer on vertical surfaces. They are advantageous in highly complex retrofit geometry where sheet membranes are difficult to detail. Limitations relative to EPDM:

- Uniform film thickness is difficult to achieve on vertical surfaces — sagging during application produces thick zones at the bottom and thin zones at the top
- Multiple coats required for full thickness
- Service life of 10 to 20 years before recoating — unsuitable as a primary behind-cladding membrane for a 50-year building life without reintervention
- Entirely dependent on substrate adhesion — any substrate delamination propagates immediately through the liquid membrane

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | PP/PE House Wrap | Self-Adhered Bituminous | Liquid PU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UV resistance (permanent) | Intrinsic — unlimited | 3-6 months maximum | 5-10 years | 5-15 years |
| Elongation at break | 300-400% | 15-30% | 50-100% | 200-400% |
| Flexibility at -10°C | Full | Limited | None | Limited |
| Complex geometry application | Excellent (tape + pre-forms) | Limited | Good | Excellent |
| Service life | 50+ years | 15-25 years | 20-25 years | 10-20 years |
| Recoating required | Never | No | No | Every 10-20 years |
| EN 13859-2 compliance | Yes | Yes | Yes | Via ETA |

## Breathability and Vapour Management

The most frequently misunderstood aspect of facade membranes is the relationship between water resistance and vapour permeability. Membriko includes a vapour analysis as part of every facade project specification — it does not assume that standard EPDM is always correct without this analysis.

### The Distinction Between Liquid Water and Water Vapour

Liquid water and water vapour are distinct physical phenomena requiring different design responses. A membrane can be watertight (stops liquid water) while still allowing vapour to diffuse through it slowly (vapour-permeable) — breathable house wraps are the familiar example. A membrane can also be simultaneously watertight and vapour-tight — as a conventional thick polyethylene sheet is.

Standard EPDM has relatively low vapour permeability (Sd values of 15 to 30 m for 1.0 mm thickness), which makes it appropriate as a vapour control layer on the warm side of insulation (interior face of the wall in winter conditions), but not the default choice for a rainscreen barrier on the cold side of insulation where vapour permeability is needed for outward drying.

### When EPDM Vapour-Tightness Is Not a Problem

**Ventilated facade assemblies**: cavity ventilation provides continuous drying capacity. Any vapour that diffuses through the wall from the interior is diluted and removed by ventilation air in the cavity. Standard low-vapour-permeability EPDM on the structural wall is technically appropriate.

**When EPDM is used as a vapour control layer on the warm side**: if EPDM is positioned on the interior face of the wall insulation, its low vapour permeability is an advantage.

### When Vapour-Open Performance Is Preferred

**ETICS applications on concrete or masonry walls**: the render finish has moderate vapour permeability; insulation boards (EPS or mineral wool) have different permeability values. A vapour-permeable (but still watertight) membrane is preferred on the structural wall behind ETICS to allow outward drying.

Membriko specifies vapour-open EPDM products with enhanced permeability (Sd values of 0.5 to 5 m) for these specific applications. These products, formulated with modified polymer structure or controlled micro-perforation, retain all of the mechanical strength and UV resistance of standard EPDM while allowing the vapour diffusion necessary for wet facade system assemblies.

## Maintenance

One of the most significant practical advantages of EPDM installed behind facade cladding is the complete absence of maintenance requirements over the building's service life.

The EPDM membrane itself requires no maintenance. It has no components that degrade with time — no plasticisers to migrate, no bitumen to oxidise, no UV stabilisers to deplete. The membrane installed by Membriko today will have the same chemical composition and the same mechanical properties in 40 years.

The components that do require periodic inspection are: silicone sealants at exposed window frame perimeters (if silicone-sealed rather than EPDM-detailed), any exposed metal coping flashings, and drainage outlets at the base of ventilated cavities (which can accumulate debris and block drainage).

Where Membriko has detailed window perimeters with EPDM sill trays and EPDM jamb flashings rather than silicone sealant, no sealant replacement is required. This is the long-term maintenance cost advantage of comprehensive EPDM detailing over sealant-dependent systems: the EPDM detail system costs more to install and nothing to maintain; the silicone system costs less to install and requires replacement every 10 to 15 years to remain watertight.

## Portuguese Facade Failures: The ETICS Problem

Portugal is one of the European countries with the highest installed volume of ETICS per capita. The construction boom of the 1990s and early 2000s produced millions of square metres of external insulation composite systems applied to residential and commercial buildings, many of which are now 20 to 30 years old — approaching or exceeding the service life of the renders and sealants applied at junctions and penetrations.

### The Most Frequent Failure Points

**Window perimeter sealant failure** — the single most common failure point. The junction between the ETICS reinforced render and the aluminium window frame requires a compressible sealant that accommodates differential thermal movement between the aluminium and the render substrate, maintains adhesion to both surfaces as the sealant ages, and is replaced when it reaches end of life (typically 10 to 15 years). In practice, original sealants are rarely replaced when they reach end of life, and water entry at the window perimeter wets the insulation boards, which delaminate from the structural wall as freeze-thaw cycling and the weight of wet insulation overstress the adhesive bond.

**Insufficient mechanical fixings** — the ETICS delaminates from the substrate in zones of intense wind exposure when the number or load capacity of mechanical fixings is insufficient. This failure is common on upper floors of buildings in coastal or elevated locations.

**Parapet coping detail** — water entry over the top of the wall through the parapet coping is a frequent infiltration path in multi-storey buildings. Where the coping has no adequate overhanging drip edge and does not direct water outward, water accumulates at the top of the ETICS system and enters laterally or beneath the coping.

**Base of wall** — splash absorption from the pavement surface and capillary rising damp from the ground is a recurring problem in buildings where the base of the ETICS system has no adequate termination with a horizontal membrane and impermeable starter profile.

**Balcony soffit junctions** — water draining from the underside of balconies (soffit) can contact the edge of the ETICS system and wick into the interface between the insulation boards and the structural wall.

### Membriko's Rehabilitation Response

Membriko has extensive experience in rehabilitating buildings with actively failing ETICS systems. The typical process includes: complete assessment by probing and pull-off testing; selective removal of the most severely damaged zones (not necessarily the entire facade); EPDM membrane installation over the exposed structural wall or over the sound ETICS substrate; application of a new ETICS system or ventilated facade over the EPDM.

This process eliminates the risk of infiltration permanently. The renewed ETICS system will have the EPDM behind it as a second barrier — and when the new render reaches end of life in 20 to 30 years, the EPDM membrane will remain intact and performing its function.

## Regulatory Framework: EN 13859-2

European standardisation for facade membranes is distinct from the standardisation for roofing membranes. Membriko specifies to the correct standards for each application.

### European Level

**EN 13859-2** — Flexible sheets for waterproofing — underlays for walls. This is the harmonised product standard governing flexible sheet products used as secondary water-shedding layers in facade assemblies. CE marking under this standard is mandatory for products marketed for facade applications in the EU/EEA including Portugal. Declared performance characteristics include driving rain resistance (EN 12865), tensile strength and elongation (EN 12311), UV resistance (EN 1297), and dimensional stability (EN 1107).

**EN 13830** — Curtain walling — product standard referencing water penetration resistance and drainage design for curtain wall systems.

**EN 15026** — Hygrothermal performance of building components — used for vapour analysis in facade assembly specifications.

### Portuguese and National Level

**REH (Decree-Law 118/2013)** — Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Habitação — sets maximum thermal transmittance values (U-values) for opaque facade elements; air permeability affects the energy class rating.

**RCCTE (Decree-Law 80/2006, partially replaced by REH)** — historical reference for thermal performance calculations still used by many Portuguese designers.

**RGEU** — No specific facade membrane requirement, but implies weathertightness of all exterior building elements.

**LNEC Technical Approval Documents** — May be required for specific products or systems in public sector projects or where CE marking alone is insufficient for the client or licensing authority.

Membriko specifies only CE-marked products conforming to EN 13859-2 and, where the project requires it, consults LNEC for additional system validation.

## Energy Performance Integration

The EPDM facade membrane installed by Membriko contributes to the energy performance of the building through two mechanisms distinct from its primary water-control role.

### Contribution to Airtightness

The energy envelope of a building depends on two barriers: the thermal insulation barrier (which limits heat conduction) and the air barrier (which limits convection). When EPDM is installed with tape-sealed laps and penetrations detailed with EPDM accessories, the membrane functions as a continuous air barrier. This contribution is relevant for projects with air permeability requirements under the REH regulation (energy class A or A+, where the measured infiltration rate in a blower-door test must be below 2 to 3 m³/h·m² at 50 Pa).

Membriko co-ordinates the facade membrane installation with the project's airtightness requirements, sealing all penetrations with EPDM accessories and compatible sealants that maintain air barrier continuity. This approach eliminates a separate dedicated air barrier product — frequently specified independently on high-performance projects — and its associated installation cost.

### Thermal Bridge Prevention at Mechanical Fixings

Mechanical fixings that penetrate the insulation layer — ETICS fixings, ventilated facade support brackets, or membrane fasteners — are point thermal bridges: each fixing conducts heat from the interior to the exterior through the insulation. In high energy-performance projects, the position and type of fixings is part of the thermal performance calculation.

Membriko specifies thermally broken fastener systems (fasteners with insulating sleeves or plastic caps) and the correct positioning of fixings in relation to the insulation layer when the project requires it. This specification is based on the calculation of the point thermal transmittance (chi-value, χ) per fixing in accordance with EN ISO 10211, and is included in the technical project report delivered to the client.

## Why Membriko for Your Facade Waterproofing

Membriko is a Portuguese company, based in Pombal, with the capacity to work across the entire national territory. We are EPDM specialists — not a generalist waterproofing contractor that installs whichever system is cheapest or most available. All of our technical training, all of our investment in tooling and accessories, all of our accumulated experience is focused on the best possible application of this material across all of its facade configurations.

Membriko does not install facade membranes by intuition or by repetition of work habits. We install to written specifications, with CE-certified products, in conformance with applicable standards. Every project has technical documentation — specification, installation record, photographic record of the watertightness test — delivered to the client together with the 15-year warranty certificate.

The 15-year warranty Membriko issues on facade installations is not a promise on paper. It is supported by the demonstrated longevity of the material, the verified quality of the installation, and the ongoing presence of the company to honour that commitment. Membriko maintains contact with its clients, is available for inspection when requested, and responds to any situation covered by the warranty throughout its full term.

If you have a facade with active water ingress, an ETICS system with degraded window sealants, a ventilated facade to specify, or a building under rehabilitation that requires a durable waterproofing solution, Membriko is prepared to help with a free technical assessment — no obligation, and an honest report on what your facade actually needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a rainscreen membrane and why do I need one on my building facade?

A rainscreen membrane is a continuous watertight layer installed between the structural wall and the exterior cladding. Its purpose is to stop any water that penetrates the primary cladding — through joints, cracks, or detailing failures — before that water reaches the structural elements, thermal insulation, or interior. In Portugal's driving rain climate, with Class 3 and Class 4 driving rain intensities on exposed northwest-facing facades along the entire Atlantic coast, a cladding system without a behind-cladding membrane has no safety margin when joints deteriorate — which they inevitably will over the decades.

### Can EPDM be installed directly over existing render without removing it?

Yes, in most rehabilitation cases. If the existing render has a pull-off strength above 0.08 N/mm² (tested with a portable adhesion tester per EN 1542), is free of widespread delamination, and has no active structural cracks wider than 3 mm, EPDM can be installed over it after cleaning and treatment of active cracks. Membriko systematically assesses the existing render during the initial technical visit and recommends installing over it or removing it based on objective technical criteria, not commercial preference. Installation over existing render eliminates the cost and waste of full render removal.

### What is the difference between EPDM for a facade and a self-adhered bituminous underlay?

The differences are material to the long-term decision. EPDM has a service life exceeding 50 years and intrinsic UV resistance with no time limit — it can be exposed through open cladding joints throughout the life of the building without degradation. Self-adhered bituminous underlay becomes brittle under UV exposure in Portuguese conditions within 5 to 10 years. EPDM elongates 300 to 400% to bridge structural cracks; bituminous sheet elongates 50 to 100% and accumulates fatigue under thermal cycling. For high-exposure facades or open-jointed cladding, EPDM is technically superior. For point sill details in protected positions, both solutions may be appropriate — Membriko selects the correct product for each specific application.

### How does the EPDM membrane function in a ventilated facade?

In a ventilated facade, the EPDM membrane is mechanically fixed to the structural wall with stainless steel fasteners in the lap zones between sheets. The ventilated air cavity (minimum 20 mm, typically 40-80 mm) sits between the EPDM face and the back of the cladding panel, suspended on the metal subframe. Rain that penetrates the open or semi-open panel joints falls onto the EPDM surface and drains downward by gravity (the membrane is vertical) to the base of the cavity, where it exits through drainage slots above the base flashing. EPDM never accumulates water — it drains it harmlessly away. The cavity is ventilated at top and bottom, removing residual moisture by convection.

### Does EPDM on a facade require maintenance over time?

No. The EPDM membrane installed behind facade cladding requires no maintenance during its service life. Unlike silicone sealants at window perimeters — which must be inspected every 5 to 10 years and replaced when they crack or lose adhesion — the EPDM membrane does not degrade, crack, or lose adhesion with age. Where Membriko uses EPDM detailing at window perimeters and copings (rather than sealant), those details are also maintenance-free. The only maintenance activities are periodic cleaning of drainage slots at the base of ventilated cavities (to prevent debris blockage) and visual inspection of exposed metal flashings for mechanical damage.

### How long does it take to install EPDM membrane on a facade?

Installation rate depends on facade complexity. A straightforward rectangular facade with few openings: approximately 150 to 200 m² per day for a two-person Membriko crew. Complex facades with multiple windows, balconies, pipe penetrations, and horizontal elements: 60 to 100 m² per day, owing to the time required for detailed junction work. Membriko provides a programme timeline with every proposal, based on the specific facade geometry, so that the client can plan the construction sequence with other contractors (facade subframe installer, glazing contractor, cladding installer).

### Is EPDM compatible with the aluminium support structure of a ventilated facade?

Yes. EPDM is chemically neutral and compatible with aluminium alloy, galvanised steel, stainless steel, and composite facade support systems. Fasteners for mechanical fixing of the EPDM to masonry or concrete substrates must be stainless steel or hot-dip galvanised to prevent electrochemical corrosion at the fixing point. Membriko specifies fastener type and material based on the substrate and the support system to be installed over the membrane, in co-ordination with the facade subframe designer.

### Does Membriko offer a warranty for facade waterproofing? How long?

Yes. Membriko issues a 15-year installation warranty certificate for facade membrane systems. This warranty covers workmanship: the watertightness of the installed membrane system, lap integrity, and detail sealing at penetrations and junctions. The warranty is supported by a photographic record of the post-installation water hose spray test. For large commercial projects, Membriko can co-ordinate the membrane product manufacturer's warranty — extending material coverage for up to 20 years — in addition to the installation warranty. Membriko's installation warranty is separate from and additional to the statutory 5-year defects liability under the Portuguese Civil Code (Article 1225), which is cumulative and not substituted by the contractual warranty.
