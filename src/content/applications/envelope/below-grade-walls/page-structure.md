# Below-Grade Walls — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Below-grade wall waterproofing is a conversion-critical page for Membriko. The audience is
architecture professionals, structural engineers, project developers, and building owners who
have either discovered or anticipated a moisture problem in a buried wall system — and who
are at the decision-making stage. Unlike roofing pages where browsing is more exploratory,
visitors to this page have an active problem or are actively specifying a solution.

The persuasion arc must accomplish three things efficiently:
1. Establish that Membriko understands below-grade moisture at an engineering level — not just
   as a trade
2. Demonstrate that EPDM is the technically correct choice for buried walls, with specific
   evidence that addresses the real-world conditions of Portuguese construction
3. Make the engagement step (contact, consultation) feel like the logical conclusion of reading
   the page, not a sales pressure moment

The section order follows a problem-to-solution arc:
1. Stakes — why below-grade moisture is categorically different from surface moisture
2. Moisture mechanisms — technical depth establishing understanding of the problem
3. Wall types — the reader identifies their specific situation
4. EPDM chemistry — why this material resists what destroys alternatives
5. Installation method — external application and the positive-side principle
6. Protection board and drainage — showing system thinking, not just membrane thinking
7. Comparison — handle the alternative material objection
8. Radon — the secondary benefit many readers will not have considered
9. Tech specs — data for specifiers
10. Maintenance — lifecycle reassurance
11. Portuguese ground conditions — local credibility
12. Regulations — compliance certainty
13. Retrofit — the large segment who need remediation, not new construction
14. FAQ — long-tail intent capture and pre-sales query reduction
15. CTA — conversion

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Establish the severity of the problem before any product mention.

**Content:**
- Headline: "Impermeabilização de Paredes Enterradas: Quando o Erro Não Tem Remédio" /
  "Below-Grade Wall Waterproofing: When Getting It Wrong Has No Second Chance"
- Sub-headline: Once a wall is buried, the membrane is inaccessible. It must perform for the
  life of the structure — 50 to 100 years — without the possibility of replacement.
- Four stat blocks:
  - 50+ anos de vida útil provada / 50+ years proven service life
  - ≥ 300% de elongação / ≥ 300% elongation for crack bridging
  - pH 2-14 de resistência química / pH 2-14 chemical resistance
  - Garantia de 20 anos / 20-year installation warranty
- CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico Gratuito" (primary) + "Ver Especificações Técnicas" anchor link
  (secondary)

**Design note:** Background should suggest depth and soil — dark, textured. Hero stat colours
should maintain contrast.

## Section 2: Why Below-Grade Moisture is Different

**Purpose:** Show we understand the specific engineering problem of buried walls, establishing
technical authority before presenting the solution.

**Content:** Four moisture mechanisms with technical explanation:

1. **Pressão Hidrostática (Hydrostatic Pressure)**
   - Water table depth creates lateral pressure: every metre of head = 9.81 kPa on the
     membrane. At 2 m water head, the pressure at the base is 19.6 kPa. At 5 m: 49 kPa.
   - EN 1928 Method B tests EPDM to 60 kPa minimum — exceeds typical residential basement loads.
   - Portugal-specific: northern coastal alluvial soils maintain water tables at 0.5-2 m depth
     in winter. Tagus estuary urban developments regularly build at 3-4 m below water table.

2. **Sucção Capilar (Capillary Suction)**
   - In fine-grained soils (silt, clay), moisture migrates by capillary action regardless of
     groundwater table depth. Clay soils in the Alentejo can sustain capillary rise of 15 m+.
   - This is why many Portuguese basements are damp even in drought years: the soil moisture
     regime is driven by capillarity, not the table.

3. **Transmissão de Vapor (Vapour Transmission)**
   - Soil air is typically at 95-100% relative humidity. Warm soil air carries water vapour
     through permeable membranes by diffusion — creating condensation on cold interior surfaces
     even when no liquid water penetrates.
   - EPDM's vapour resistance factor μ ≈ 35,000 makes it practically impermeable to vapour.

4. **Química do Solo (Soil Chemistry Attack)**
   - Portuguese soils are chemically aggressive: humic acids in the Pinhal de Leiria podzols,
     alkaline pH from concrete-adjacent soils, sulphates in Alentejo clays, chlorides in
     coastal aquifers. Each is a degradation mechanism for alternative membrane materials.

**Visual:** Cross-section diagram of a buried wall showing the four moisture pathways with
directional arrows. Portugal soil chemistry map as a supplementary element.

## Section 3: Wall Types — Identify Your Application

**Purpose:** Help the reader immediately locate their specific situation, increasing relevance
and conversion.

**Content:** Three wall type cards with: description, key waterproofing requirements,
membrane thickness recommendation, critical details.

1. **Caves e Pisos Enterrados (Basements and Below-Grade Floors)**
   - Reinforced concrete perimeter walls, 1.5-4.0 m buried depth
   - Requirements: hydrostatic resistance, crack bridging, continuous barrier at wall-floor
     junction, grade termination
   - Membrane: 1.0-1.5 mm EPDM external, with drainage composite
   - Critical details: construction joint at wall/slab, pipe penetrations, termination bar

2. **Muros de Suporte (Retaining Walls)**
   - Gravity, cantilever or anchored walls retaining soil above foundation level
   - Requirements: lateral hydrostatic and earth pressure, root resistance, seismic movement
     accommodation (relevant in seismic zones A/B of Portugal)
   - Membrane: 1.5 mm EPDM with geocomposite drainage board
   - Critical details: base-of-wall drainage, anchor penetrations, adjacent footing continuity

3. **Construção Enterrada / Terraço Verde (Earth-Sheltered and Green-Roof Buildings)**
   - Buildings partially or fully buried in hillside or under landscape cover
   - Requirements: root resistance, high overburden load, sustained hydrostatic head from
     saturated growing medium, UV resistance at perimeter
   - Membrane: 1.5-2.0 mm EPDM (FLL root-resistance certified grade)
   - Critical details: drainage layer under growing medium, edge terminations, buried service
     penetrations

**Visual:** Three illustrated cross-section diagrams showing each wall type with membrane
position highlighted.

## Section 4: Why EPDM for Buried Walls

**Purpose:** Technical authority section. The polymer chemistry explanation that makes the
case for EPDM at a level no competitor's marketing page provides.

**Content:**

**Chemistry of resistance:**
- Saturated carbon-carbon backbone: no double bonds for organic acids, alkaline hydroxides,
  or ozone to attack. Not a surface treatment — intrinsic to the molecular structure.
- No plasticisers: EPDM's flexibility is permanent, requiring no additive that depletes over
  50 years of soil contact
- Carbon black loading (30-40 phr): UV absorber (relevant at grade level), mechanical
  reinforcement, thermal conductor

**Properties table:**
| Property | Value | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% (typical 350-450%) | EN 12311-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Watertightness | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 (Method B) |
| Water absorption | < 1% by mass | ASTM D471 |
| Water vapour resistance | μ ≈ 35,000 | EN 1931 |
| Root resistance | Pass FLL / EN 13948 | FLL method |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| CE marking | EN 13967 | — |
| Projected service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ |

**Crack bridging data point:** A 1.5 mm EPDM membrane bridging a 10 mm crack opening under
3 m hydrostatic head sustains approximately 60-80% local elongation — within the material's
elastic range.

**Visual:** Molecular diagram showing saturated backbone vs. bitumen's unsaturated chain.

## Section 5: Installation — The External Application Method

**Purpose:** Demonstrate installation expertise and the logic of positive-side application.

**Content:** Six-stage sequential process with visual timeline.

1. **Diagnóstico e Projeto** — Free technical visit, water table assessment, structural
   crack survey, soil chemistry data review, specification development
2. **Preparação do Suporte** — Surface cleaning, void and crack repair, projection grinding,
   render coat for masonry substrates
3. **Aplicação da Membrana** — Self-adhesive or bonded EPDM, maximised panel width to
   minimise seams, QuickSeam tape at all overlaps (≥ 75 mm), pre-formed accessories at
   critical details
4. **Pontos Singulares** — Wall-to-floor junction continuity, pipe penetrations with EPDM
   sleeves, termination bar and sealant at grade level
5. **Placa de Protecção e Drenagem** — Protection board installation (XPS, drainage composite,
   or rubber-faced mineral board) immediately after membrane completion
6. **Retroescavação Controlada** — Backfilling in controlled lifts with selected fill graded
   to avoid membrane damage; French drain pipe and granular surround installed at base

**Visual:** Exploded wall assembly diagram showing each layer: soil / drainage composite /
EPDM / concrete wall / internal finish. Numbered and labelled.

---

## Section 6: Drainage Layer Integration

**Purpose:** Show system thinking — Membriko specifies a complete drainage-and-waterproofing
system, not just a membrane.

**Content:** Three drainage system configurations with recommendation guidance.

1. **Sistema de Drenagem Periférica** (Peripheral French Drain System)
   - Perforated pipe at footing level, granular surround, geotextile filter
   - Best for: new construction with sufficient perimeter access
   - Reduces design hydrostatic head to near-zero in well-drained soils

2. **Placa de Drenagem Geocomposita** (Geocomposite Drainage Board)
   - Dimpled HDPE drainage core with geotextile filter bonded to outer face
   - Placed against EPDM membrane before backfill
   - Best for: all new construction; provides protection, drainage, and filtration in one product
   - Standard Membriko specification for below-grade walls

3. **Sistema de Bomba e Sumidouro** (Sump and Pump System)
   - For sites where gravity discharge is impossible (low-lying plots, urban basements)
   - Sump chamber collects drainage water, submersible pump discharges above grade
   - Membriko designs and specifies sump sizing based on drainage catchment and groundwater flow

**Key principle to communicate:** Drainage + Waterproofing = System. Neither element is
adequate without the other in high water-table conditions.

## Section 7: EPDM vs Competing Systems

**Purpose:** Address the alternative material objection proactively. Framed as engineering
comparison, not competitive attack.

**Content:** Comparison table with 6 rows and 5 columns.

| Characteristic | EPDM | Betume SBS/APP | Cimentício | HDPE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongação (crack bridging) | 300-450% | 30-250% | 0-2% | 12-18% yield limit |
| Resistência a ácidos orgânicos | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Excellent |
| Ambiente alcalino (pH > 10) | Excellent | Poor — saponificação | Excellent | Excellent |
| Resistência a raízes | Pass FLL/EN 13948 | Not rated / at risk | N/A | Pass |
| Vida útil enterrada | 50+ years | 20-35 years | 15-25 years | 40+ years |
| Execução em obra | Cold application | Torch / hot melt | Trowel / spray | Extrusion weld |

Below table: honest paragraph acknowledging that cementitious crystalline systems are the
correct solution for interior (negative-side) retrofit where excavation is impossible, and
that Membriko advises on this distinction in every consultation.

**Visual:** Colour-coded comparison table with EPDM column highlighted.

## Section 8: Radon and Soil Gas Protection

**Purpose:** Surface a secondary benefit that is important in Portugal and that competitors
do not communicate — establishing Membriko's knowledge depth.

**Content:**

**Portuguese radon context:**
- Portugal has among the highest measured indoor radon concentrations in Europe
- High-risk geology: granitic rocks of Norte, Beiras, Serra da Estrela, Alentejo interior
- Decreto-Lei 108/2018: national reference levels (300 Bq/m³ existing; 200 Bq/m³ new)
- Radon mitigation is mandatory in new buildings in high-risk municipalities

**EPDM as radon barrier:**
- Vulcanised EPDM has radon diffusion coefficient comparable to HDPE geomembranes
- Superior to PVC (depletes as plasticiser migrates) and SBS bitumen (micro-porous)
- Dual function: waterproofing membrane AND radon barrier in one installation

**Visual:** Map of Portuguese radon risk zones. Callout: "Zonas de Risco de Radão — o EPDM
protege contra a água e contra o gás."

## Section 9: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Data for specifiers, engineers and architects. Creates a document reference point
that justifies downloading or saving the page.

**Content:**

**Performance table (full):**
| Property | Value | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness range | 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% (typical 350-450%) | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 10 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |

| Dimensional stability | < 1% at 80°C | EN 1107-2 |
| Reaction to fire | Class E | EN 13501-1 |
| CE marking | EN 13967 | — |

**Thickness selection guidance:**
- 1.0 mm: above water table, low hydrostatic pressure, domestic construction
- 1.5 mm: standard below-grade; water table within buried depth; commercial/residential
- 2.0 mm: high hydrostatic pressure; aggressive soil chemistry; earth-sheltered buildings

## Section 10: Maintenance and Lifecycle

**Purpose:** Reassure the reader that EPDM requires minimal maintenance and that Membriko
provides ongoing support — reducing post-purchase anxiety.

**Content:**

**What below-grade EPDM requires:**
- No routine maintenance once buried: the membrane is inaccessible and performs without
  human intervention
- Annual inspection of visible elements: grade termination sealant, drainage outlet function,
  sump pump operation (where installed)
- Every 5-10 years: review of termination sealant at grade level; reapplication if weathered

**What below-grade EPDM does not require:**
- No recoating (unlike epoxy or polyurethane coatings)
- No joint maintenance (unlike multi-layer bituminous systems)
- No re-welding of seams (unlike HDPE or PVC)
- No replacement at year 15-20 (unlike bituminous systems under Portuguese conditions)

**Membriko maintenance offer:** Annual external inspection of accessible elements (drainage
outlets, grade termination, visible membrane sections at light wells and surface breaks),
with written condition report and any necessary minor sealant remediation.

**Visual:** Simple timeline showing EPDM maintenance cost vs. bituminous system maintenance
cost over 50 years. EPDM = flat low line. Bituminous = increasing with step-change at
replacement at year 15-20.

## Section 11: Portuguese Ground Conditions

**Purpose:** Local credibility and climate-specific authority. Proves Membriko understands
Portugal, not generic European guidance.

**Content:** Four regional profiles, each with: soil type, water table behaviour, specific
membrane challenge, Membriko response.

1. **Norte (Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Douro)**
   - Granitic soils, high rainfall (1,200-2,000 mm/year), shallow impermeable horizons
   - Perched water tables common in winter; humic acids from podzolic forest soils
   - Challenge: chemical aggressiveness + seasonal hydrostatic cycles
   - EPDM response: acid-resistant saturated backbone; elastic recovery from seasonal cycles

2. **Centro (Beira Litoral, Estremadura — including Pombal/Leiria)**
   - Mixed: calcareous limestone, alluvial plains, Pinhal de Leiria podzols
   - Pombal area: Jurassic limestone meets alluvial zones — water table at 1-2.5 m in alluvial
   - Challenge: alkaline groundwater in limestone + organic acids in forest soil adjacent
   - EPDM response: resistant to both extremes simultaneously

3. **Alentejo**
   - Deep clay soils, low rainfall (500-700 mm/year), seasonal water table variation
   - Summer water table: 10-15 m depth. Winter recharge: 1-2 m depth in clay zones
   - Challenge: membrane must handle 8-month dry period followed by full hydrostatic load
   - EPDM response: elastic recovery maintains seal through dry/wet cycling; no plasticiser
     loss in dry conditions

4. **Algarve / Costa**
   - Low rainfall (400-600 mm/year); coastal aquifer exploitation; saline groundwater near coast
   - Challenge: saltwater intrusion in coastal zones; high summer ground temperatures at
     shallow depth
   - EPDM response: fully saline-resistant; service temperature ceiling 130°C far exceeds any
     Portuguese subsoil temperature

**Visual:** Portugal map with four regions highlighted and key data callouts per region.

## Section 12: Regulatory Framework

**Purpose:** Eliminate compliance doubt for architects, engineers and public-sector clients.

**Content:**

**European standards:**
- **EN 13967**: Flexible sheets for waterproofing — below-grade applications. Primary CE
  marking standard for EPDM used in foundation and buried wall waterproofing. Specifies minimum
  performance for thickness, tensile properties, elongation, watertightness, and chemical
  resistance.
- **EN 1928**: Determination of watertightness under water pressure (Method B: pressure test).
  Referenced in EN 13967. EPDM membranes specified by Membriko pass at pressures corresponding
  to the design water head at each project.
- **EN 14909**: Flexible sheets for waterproofing — plastic and rubber wall and floor joints.
  Relevant for junction details between wall membrane and floor membrane.

**Portuguese national requirements:**
- **RGEU Art. 96**: Requires buildings to be protected against humidity and groundwater
  infiltration. Does not prescribe method but establishes the performance obligation.
- **Decreto-Lei 108/2018**: National radon action plan. In new buildings in high-risk
  municipalities, below-grade membranes serving as radon barriers must be adequately specified.
  EPDM meets and exceeds this requirement.
- **LNEC Especificações**: LNEC technical specifications for waterproofing in civil structures;
  Membriko's installation specifications are aligned with relevant LNEC guidance.

**Seismic design:**
- **NP EN 1998-5** (Eurocode 8 — Geotechnical): Relevant for retaining walls and basement
  structures in Portugal's seismic zones (Zone A in Algarve/south Alentejo; Zone B/C in
  central and northern regions). EPDM's elastic elongation accommodates the cyclic strains
  imposed by seismic events without permanent deformation.

**Visual:** Standards badge grid (EN 13967, EN 1928, CE marking, LNEC). Reference to radon
legislation.

## Section 13: Retrofit Waterproofing of Existing Walls

**Purpose:** Capture the large segment of potential clients with existing moisture problems
in buried walls, not just new construction.

**Content:**

**The retrofit challenge:** Most Portuguese buildings constructed before 1990 have inadequate
or failed below-grade waterproofing. Retrofit options depend critically on whether external
excavation is possible.

**Where external excavation is possible (Membriko's primary retrofit service):**
- Strip existing failed membrane (usually bituminous)
- Repair structural cracks with appropriate cementitious mortar
- Install EPDM on the cleaned external face
- Install drainage composite and French drain system
- Backfill with selected material
- Expected performance: identical to new construction

**Where external excavation is not possible (Membriko advises honestly):**
- Internal cavity drainage system (studded HDPE sheet creating a managed drainage cavity
  on the internal face) — Membriko can coordinate or advise
- Cementitious crystalline injection into the concrete wall
- EPDM is not the correct solution in this configuration — and Membriko will say so

**Signs that a retrofit is needed:**
- Damp patches on internal wall finishes, especially at or below grade level
- White efflorescence deposits on internal walls (mineral salts carried by moisture)
- Standing water on basement floor after rainfall or seasonal water table rise
- Biological growth (mould, mildew) on interior wall surfaces at low level
- Rust staining from reinforcement corrosion through the wall face

**Visual:** Before/after photo pair of a retrofit basement waterproofing. Flowchart of
retrofit decision: excavation possible? Yes → EPDM. No → internal solution.

## Section 14: FAQ

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search queries and reduce repetitive pre-sales questions.
Unique questions specific to below-grade walls — no overlap with other application FAQs.

Eight questions:

1. **O EPDM pode ser aplicado em paredes de pedra ou alvenaria existente?**
   Yes, with surface preparation. Old stone or masonry walls require a polymer-modified mortar
   render coat to create a smooth, continuous substrate before EPDM adhesion. The render must
   cure fully before membrane application. Membriko assesses substrate suitability during the
   diagnostic visit.

2. **Qual a diferença entre impermeabilização positiva e negativa em paredes enterradas?**
   Positive-side waterproofing (EPDM) is applied on the exterior face, between the soil and
   the structure — the water-source side. The membrane is pressed against the wall by
   hydrostatic pressure. Negative-side systems are applied on the interior. Positive-side is
   technically superior for new construction and where external excavation is feasible. For
   existing buildings without excavation access, internal solutions may be the only option.

3. **O EPDM resiste às raízes de árvores e arbustos em jardins adjacentes a cave?**
   Yes. EPDM passes the FLL root penetration test (the same standard used for green roof
   membranes, which are in permanent contact with plant roots). This resistance is intrinsic
   to the material, not a separate coating. Bituminous membranes do not reliably pass this test.

4. **Preciso de dreno periférico além da membrana EPDM?**
   In most below-grade conditions, yes. Drainage reduces the hydrostatic head on the membrane
   and is the correct integrated approach. Without drainage, the membrane bears the full
   design hydrostatic load. In well-drained soils with low water tables, drainage may not be
   needed — but Membriko assesses this on a project-by-project basis during the technical
   consultation.

5. **O que acontece se a membrana for perfurada acidentalmente durante a retroescavação?**
   EPDM can be repaired on site using patch pieces, QuickSeam tape and primer. Any perforation
   identified before backfilling is repaired by Membriko's team before the backfilling proceeds.
   After backfilling, any detected leak requires localised excavation to access the membrane.
   This is why the protection board between membrane and backfill is mandatory — it prevents
   the majority of installation-stage damage.

6. **A membrana EPDM serve também como barreira ao radão em zonas de risco em Portugal?**
   Yes. EPDM has radon diffusion resistance comparable to HDPE geomembranes — among the most
   effective available for below-grade applications. In the granitic regions of Norte, Beiras
   and parts of Alentejo (high-risk radon zones under Decreto-Lei 108/2018), EPDM below-grade
   waterproofing provides dual-function protection against groundwater and radon in a single
   membrane layer.

7. **Com que espessura de EPDM devo especificar para uma cave com lençol freático a 3 m?**
   At 3 m water head, hydrostatic pressure at the base is approximately 29.4 kPa. Standard
   1.5 mm EPDM (rated to EN 1928 at 60 kPa) is adequate for this pressure, with appropriate
   safety margin. For water tables higher than 5 m above the base of the wall, or for
   aggressive soil chemistry conditions, 2.0 mm is specified. Membriko provides a written
   thickness specification with each project, based on site-specific hydrostatic and chemical
   data.

8. **A Membriko faz impermeabilização de paredes de cave existentes sem obras de demolição?**
   Retrofit with EPDM requires external access to the wall face — which means excavation.
   Where excavation is structurally or practically impossible (dense urban sites, party walls,
   protected structures), external EPDM application is not feasible. Membriko advises
   honestly on this limitation and can recommend and coordinate alternative solutions
   (internal cavity drainage, crystalline injection) when the circumstances require it. We do
   not propose EPDM for situations where it is not the correct technical answer.
