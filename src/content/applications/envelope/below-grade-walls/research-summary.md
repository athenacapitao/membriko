# Below-Grade Walls — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Buried Wall Waterproofing: Core Chemistry and Relevance

Below-grade wall waterproofing is among the most technically unforgiving applications in
construction. Once a wall is buried under backfill — whether a basement perimeter wall, a
retaining structure, or an earth-sheltered building envelope — there is no practical possibility
of membrane replacement without full excavation. The selected membrane must perform for the
entire service life of the structure: 50 to 100 years of continuous exposure to hydrostatic
pressure, capillary moisture, aggressive soil chemistry, microbiological contact, and differential
structural movement.

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is ideally suited to this environment because all its
critical resistance mechanisms are intrinsic to its polymer chemistry. They do not depend on
surface coatings that abrade, plasticiser packages that migrate, or sacrificial additives that
deplete. The saturated carbon-carbon backbone of the EPDM polymer chain is chemically inert to
the specific agents that degrade alternative membrane materials in buried conditions.

Key physical properties of below-grade-grade EPDM:
- Thickness range: 1.0 mm (low-pressure, above water table) to 2.0 mm (high hydrostatic
  pressure, aggressive chemistry)
- Elongation at break: ≥ 300% (EN 12311-2); typical values 350-450% for premium-grade products
- Tensile strength: ≥ 9 N/mm² (EN 12311-2)
- Water absorption: < 1% by mass (ASTM D471)
- Watertightness: pass at 60 kPa and above (EN 1928 Method B)
- Water vapour diffusion resistance: μ ≈ 35,000 (EN 1931)
- Service temperature: -45°C to +130°C continuous
- CE marking standard for below-grade applications: EN 13967

## Moisture Mechanisms in Below-Grade Wall Environments

Below-grade walls face a qualitatively different moisture challenge from above-grade surfaces.
There are five distinct moisture pathways that a buried wall membrane must resist simultaneously:

**Hydrostatic pressure.** Where the groundwater table rises above the base of the wall, lateral
hydrostatic pressure acts against the exterior membrane face. The pressure increases linearly
with water depth: every additional metre of groundwater head adds approximately 9.81 kPa
(0.098 bar) of lateral pressure. A basement wall with a water table 2 m above its base
experiences approximately 19.6 kPa at the base — a load that must be resisted by the combined
effect of the membrane, any drainage system, and the structural wall itself. EN 1928 (Method B)
tests EPDM membranes at 60 kPa minimum, equivalent to a 6 m water head, which exceeds the
hydrostatic loading of the vast majority of residential and commercial basement constructions.

**Capillary suction.** In fine-grained soils — silts, clays, peat — moisture migrates upward
and laterally by capillary action through the pore structure, regardless of whether a positive
hydrostatic head exists. Capillary moisture maintains permanent wetness against the membrane
surface even during dry weather periods when the groundwater table has dropped below the base
of the wall. This mechanism is responsible for the damp conditions observed in many Portuguese
basements that were waterproofed assuming dry conditions prevailed.

**Water vapour transmission.** Warm, humid soil air carries water vapour that migrates through
permeable membranes by diffusion pressure gradient. EPDM's water vapour diffusion resistance
factor (μ ≈ 35,000) is among the highest of any flexible membrane material, making it
effectively impermeable to vapour transmission under normal below-grade conditions.

**Driving rain and surface runoff.** At grade level and in the zone immediately below it, surface
water from rainfall and paved area runoff exerts temporary but significant hydraulic pressure
against the upper sections of buried walls. This zone — the transition between exposed and
buried conditions — is often the location of the most severe moisture damage in existing
structures, because legacy waterproofing systems were frequently detailed inadequately at the
grade transition.

**Soil contact and chemical attack.** Buried walls are in continuous contact with soil pore
water that may contain organic acids (from decomposing vegetation), sulphates, chlorides,
alkaline calcium hydroxide leaching from adjacent concrete, and microbiological agents. Each of
these represents a potential degradation mechanism for the membrane material.

## EPDM Chemistry Under Below-Grade Conditions

### Saturated Backbone and Chemical Resistance

The primary polymer chain of EPDM is formed by ethylene and propylene units linked by saturated
C-C and C-H bonds. These bonds are chemically stable against the principal aggressive agents
encountered in buried environments:

- **Organic acids** (humic acids, fulvic acids from soil organic matter): no ester or ether
  groups in the EPDM backbone that organic acids can hydrolyse. EPDM is unaffected by soil
  organic acids at any concentration encountered in natural soils.
- **Alkaline hydroxides** (calcium hydroxide leaching from concrete, pH up to 12-14): no
  susceptibility to saponification, which is the mechanism that degrades bituminous membranes
  in alkaline concrete environments. EPDM immersion in 10% NaOH shows no measurable change in
  properties after 168 hours at 70°C.
- **Sulphates** (DS-2 to DS-4 soil classes per EN 206): EPDM is fully sulphate-resistant. The
  membrane also serves as a physical barrier protecting concrete from sulphate ingress.
- **Chlorides** (saline groundwater, deicing salt penetration): fully resistant at all
  concentrations up to and including seawater (35 g/L NaCl).
- **Microbiological attack**: EPDM is not a nutrient substrate for fungi, bacteria or algae.
  Biological colonisation of the membrane surface does not degrade the membrane material.

### Hydrostatic Resistance and Elongation

EPDM's elongation at break (≥ 300%, typically 350-450% for premium-grade products) is the
critical property for hydrostatic resistance. When groundwater pressure acts against a buried
wall, any crack or joint in the structural wall that opens under load becomes a point where the
membrane must bridge the opening under pressure without rupture.

A 1.5 mm EPDM membrane bridging a 10 mm crack opening at a 3 m water head experiences a local
elongation of approximately 50-80% at the bridging zone — far within the elongation capacity of
the material and without approaching failure. The same scenario with an APP bituminous membrane
(elongation 30-100%) or a cementitious coating (elongation 0-2%) results in rupture and active
water ingress.

### Absence of Plasticisers

The flexibility of EPDM is intrinsic to its vulcanised rubber network and requires no plasticiser
additives. This is a fundamental advantage over PVC membranes, which require 20-40% by mass of
phthalate or adipate plasticisers to achieve the flexibility needed for below-grade application.
Below-grade temperatures (typically 12-18°C year-round in Portuguese subsoil) accelerate
plasticiser migration less than surface temperatures, but over a 50-year service life even
the slow migration rate in cool conditions leads to measurable embrittlement.

## Below-Grade Wall Types and Membrane Requirements

### Basement Perimeter Walls (Paredes de Cave)

Full basement construction involves reinforced concrete perimeter walls extending 1.5-4.0 m
below grade. The external face of these walls is waterproofed before backfilling — the positive-
side application, where the membrane is on the water-source side of the structure. This is the
most effective configuration because the membrane is pressed against the structure by hydrostatic
pressure, improving contact and preventing lateral water migration along the membrane face.

The critical details in basement wall waterproofing are:
1. Continuity at the wall-to-base slab junction (the construction joint)
2. Termination at grade level
3. Penetrations for drainage pipes, utility conduits and structural ties

EPDM handles all three with pre-formed accessories: corner details for the wall-to-slab junction,
termination bar fixings at grade, and pipe-boot sleeves for penetrations.

### Retaining Walls (Muros de Suporte)

Retaining walls range from garden terracing walls of 0.5-1.5 m height to highway embankment
walls of 5-10 m height. Their waterproofing requirement depends on what is being retained: soil
moisture and groundwater in all cases, but also the potential for surface runoff and seasonal
infiltration in the retained soil mass.

At the base of a retaining wall, the membrane continues across the base slab or footing, creating
a continuous barrier from the wall face to the base. This continuity is essential: any gap in
the membrane at the wall-to-footing junction provides a pathway for water to enter the protected
zone by travelling along the concrete surface under the membrane.

### Earth-Sheltered Buildings (Construção Enterrada)

Earth-sheltered construction — where a building is partially or fully buried in a hillside or
under a landscaped earth cover — places extreme demands on the envelope membrane. Unlike a
conventional basement, an earth-sheltered roof and wall system may carry 1-3 m of saturated
soil above it, generating both hydrostatic pressure from the water content and significant
physical overburden pressure. The membrane must also resist root penetration from vegetation
growing in the soil cover.

EPDM's root penetration resistance (verified to FLL standard and EN 13948 — the same test
used for green roof applications) makes it uniquely suitable for earth-sheltered buildings where
the soil cover includes planted vegetation or where tree and shrub roots are present in the
surrounding soil.

## Hydrostatic and Capillary Moisture: Quantitative Analysis

### Hydrostatic Pressure Profiles for Portuguese Building Types

**Residential basement in Porto (Minho/Douro soil regime):** Typical winter water table at
0.5-1.5 m below natural ground level; seasonal fluctuation 1-2 m. A basement with 2.5 m of
buried wall depth will see the water table within the wall height for 3-5 months annually.
Peak hydrostatic pressure at base: approximately 10-15 kPa. Moderate-pressure specification:
1.0-1.5 mm EPDM.

**Commercial basement in Lisbon (alluvial plain / Tagus estuary area):** Permanent high water
table at 1-3 m depth in alluvial zones. A basement at 4 m depth will have 1-3 m of permanent
hydrostatic head. Pressure at base: 10-30 kPa. Medium-pressure specification: 1.5 mm EPDM.

**Underground car park in Algarve coastal zone:** Permanent water table at 1-4 m depth in
coastal aquifer zones; saline groundwater common. Hydrostatic pressure up to 30-40 kPa.
High-pressure specification: 1.5-2.0 mm EPDM with protection board.

### Capillary Rise in Portuguese Soils

Capillary rise height (h) in soils is approximately h = 30/d₁₀ (in metres, where d₁₀ is the
grain size in mm below which 10% of particles fall by mass). For typical Portuguese soils:

- Coarse gravel (d₁₀ = 2 mm): h ≈ 0.15 m — negligible
- Fine sand (d₁₀ = 0.1 mm): h ≈ 0.3 m — low
- Silt (d₁₀ = 0.01 mm): h ≈ 3 m — significant
- Clay (d₁₀ = 0.002 mm): h ≈ 15+ m — very high; capillary suction dominates moisture regime

The granitic silts of northern Portugal and the clay soils of the Alentejo create conditions
where capillary moisture acts over the full height of buried walls, regardless of groundwater
table depth. EPDM's resistance to capillary moisture ingress (water vapour μ ≈ 35,000; water
absorption < 1%) addresses this condition directly.

## Radon and Soil Gas Considerations

Radon (²²²Rn) is a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium-238 in
granite and certain other rocks. It migrates upward through soil pore spaces and can enter
buildings through cracks and imperfections in the floor slab and wall junctions.

Portugal is one of the countries with the highest measured indoor radon concentrations in
Europe, concentrated in areas with granitic geology: the Norte region (Minho, Trás-os-Montes),
Beiras (particularly Beira Alta and Beira Interior), the Serra da Estrela, and Alentejo granite
outcrops.

EPDM membranes are effective radon barriers. The gas transmission rate of vulcanised EPDM is
extremely low due to:
- High molecular chain density of the vulcanised network
- Low free volume within the thermoset polymer matrix
- Absence of pores or defects in production-quality membranes

Published data from the UK Health Security Agency and the German Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz
list vulcanised EPDM membranes among the most effective below-grade radon barriers, with radon
diffusion coefficients comparable to HDPE geomembranes. For basement and ground-floor
applications in high-radon zones of Portugal, EPDM's dual function as waterproofing membrane
and radon barrier is a significant specification advantage.

## Installation Methodology: External Application

### Positive-Side vs Negative-Side Application

EPDM is a positive-side waterproofing material — it is applied to the exterior (water-source)
face of the structure before backfilling. This is the technically superior application position
because:
1. Hydrostatic pressure presses the membrane against the structure, improving contact
2. The structural concrete is fully protected from water contact, chemical attack and
   carbonation throughout its service life
3. Cracks that develop in the concrete after construction are bridged by the membrane, which
   spans the crack without water ingress

Negative-side (interior) application of EPDM is technically possible in some configurations
but is not the primary use case. For retrofit waterproofing of existing basements where external
excavation is not possible, internal cavity drainage systems or cementitious crystalline coatings
are typically the appropriate solution, and Membriko advises clients accordingly.

### Surface Preparation for Below-Grade Application

The concrete or masonry substrate must meet specific conditions before EPDM adhesion is
attempted:
- Surface must be structurally sound: no delaminating concrete, no loose aggregate or
  honeycombing
- Surface must be clean: free from form-release oil, curing compound, surface laitance
  (usually removed by light scarification or high-pressure washing)
- Surface moisture: concrete can be damp at the time of application for self-adhesive EPDM
  systems, but must meet the specific moisture content requirement of the adhesive system chosen
- Protrusions and sharp edges must be ground or chamfered to prevent point loads and tearing

For masonry walls (traditional stone or block masonry common in Portuguese retrofit applications),
an initial render coat of polymer-modified mortar is usually required to provide a smooth,
continuous surface that the EPDM can adhere to.

### Membrane Application Sequence

1. Application of self-adhesive EPDM or priming with contact adhesive for bonded systems
2. Application of membrane in panels of maximum width (up to 15.25 m wide rolls available),
   minimising seams
3. Seaming: all overlaps bonded with QuickSeam tape (minimum 75 mm overlap width) and primer,
   rolled under pressure to ensure full contact
4. Critical details: wall-to-footing junction, penetration seals, termination at grade
5. Installation of protection board against the EPDM face before backfilling
6. Backfilling in controlled lifts using selected fill to avoid damaging the membrane

## Protection Board and Drainage Layer Integration

### The Protection Board Function

The EPDM membrane must be protected from mechanical damage during the backfilling process
and from sustained point loads from coarse aggregate in service. A protection board — typically
20-25 mm extruded polystyrene (XPS), a prefabricated composite drainage/protection board,
or a rubber-faced mineral board — is installed against the external EPDM face immediately
after membrane installation and before backfilling commences.

The protection board performs three functions simultaneously:
1. **Mechanical protection**: distributes the point loads from aggregate particles and
   construction equipment over the membrane face, preventing puncture during backfilling
2. **Drainage**: composite drainage boards incorporate a dimpled or cuspated drainage core
   that carries groundwater downward to the perimeter drain, reducing hydrostatic head
3. **Thermal insulation** (where XPS is specified): reduces heat loss through the wall,
   contributing to energy performance under Portuguese regulations (REH)

### Drainage System Integration

Below-grade waterproofing and drainage are co-dependent systems. A drainage layer that
removes groundwater before it accumulates to design hydrostatic head dramatically reduces
membrane loading and the risk of ingress at any minor imperfection. The standard drainage
system for Portuguese below-grade construction:

- **Perimeter French drain** (dreno francês): perforated PVC or PE pipe, 150 mm minimum
  diameter, laid in a granular drainage bed (20-40 mm clean washed aggregate) at the base
  of the wall footing, wrapped in a geotextile filter to prevent soil fines migration
- **Drainage blanket**: 300-600 mm of free-draining gravel or drainage geocomposite against
  the wall face, above the perimeter drain, to intercept and direct surface and subsurface
  water downward to the drain
- **Sump and pump** (where gravity drainage is not possible): underground sump chamber
  collecting drainage water, with submersible pump discharging to a surface drainage system

The transition between the drainage system and the EPDM membrane must be compatible: sharp
aggregate must not be in direct contact with the membrane. Geocomposite drainage boards
(geotextile filter bonded to dimpled drainage core) are the preferred solution as they provide
a smooth, membrane-compatible contact face.

## EPDM vs Competing Systems for Below-Grade Walls

### EPDM vs Bituminous Membranes (SBS and APP Modified Bitumen)

Modified bituminous membranes dominate below-grade waterproofing in Portugal by volume, driven
by installer familiarity and lower initial material cost. The technical comparison, however,
favours EPDM significantly for long-duration below-grade service:

**Crack bridging**: EPDM at 300-450% elongation bridges concrete cracks of 5-20 mm without
rupture. SBS bitumen at 150-250% elongation and APP bitumen at 30-100% elongation have
substantially lower crack bridging capacity. Foundation concrete cracks of 0.5-5 mm are universal
in the first decade of structural life due to thermal movement, shrinkage, and differential
settlement.

**Alkaline environment**: SBS bitumen is susceptible to saponification in strongly alkaline
environments (pH > 10), a condition created by calcium hydroxide leaching from Portland cement
concrete. EPDM is unaffected at any pH.

**Organic acid environment**: SBS and APP bitumen are degraded by humic acids in organic soils.
This is a direct risk in the Leiria/Pombal region, where foundations abut the Pinhal de Leiria
forest with its organic acid-rich podzolic soils. EPDM is fully resistant.

**Root penetration**: Bituminous membranes are recognised as susceptible to penetration by
tree and shrub roots, which follow moisture gradients. EPDM passes the FLL root penetration
test without modification.

**Service life**: Independent assessments project EPDM at 50+ years below-grade. Modified
bitumen membranes are assessed at 20-35 years, with the lower end of this range typical for
aggressive soil chemistry conditions.

### EPDM vs Cementitious Waterproofing

Cementitious waterproofing systems — crystalline admixtures (Xypex, Sika Crystallia, Penetron),
rigid cement-based slurries, and polymer-modified cementitious coatings — are commonly used in
Portugal as primary or secondary barriers on concrete surfaces.

**Crack bridging**: Cementitious systems have zero elongation. Any crack wider than approximately
0.4 mm (crystalline systems) or 0.1 mm (rigid cement coatings) propagates directly through
the waterproofing layer. EPDM bridges cracks to 15-20 mm width in the membrane plane.

**Surface compatibility**: Cementitious systems bond only to concrete or masonry. They cannot
waterproof expansion joints, pipe penetrations, or the transition between different substrate
materials. EPDM, with appropriate primers, adheres to and waterproofs concrete, masonry, steel
pipes, PVC conduits, and mixed-material substrates.

**Positive vs negative side**: Cementitious systems can be applied on the negative (interior)
side, which gives them an advantage in retrofit situations where external excavation is
impractical. Membriko acknowledges this distinction honestly.

**Service life**: Cementitious coatings require re-application of the polymer-modified component
at 15-25 years in the conditions of active groundwater environments. Crystalline systems are
more durable but remain crack-bridging limited.

### EPDM vs HDPE Geomembranes

HDPE geomembranes are used in civil engineering containment applications and occasionally
specified for building foundation waterproofing.

**Flexibility at service strains**: HDPE has high elongation at break (700-800%) but a low
yield strain (12-18%). Beyond yield, HDPE undergoes permanent deformation (stress whitening,
thinning) and does not recover. In practice, HDPE's effective crack-bridging capacity in
building service conditions is limited to strains below 12-18%. EPDM maintains full elastic
recovery throughout its 300-400% elongation range — it returns to its original dimensions
after crack closure.

**Seaming**: HDPE requires thermal extrusion welding, a specialised skill requiring portable
welding equipment and operator certification. Quality depends heavily on ambient conditions.
EPDM seams use QuickSeam tape and primer — simpler, faster, more reliably field-executable.

## Radon Barrier Performance of EPDM

Published gas transmission data for waterproofing membranes relevant to below-grade wall
specification:

| Material | Relative Radon Resistance |
|---|---|
| EPDM 1.0 mm | Very high — comparable to HDPE |
| EPDM 1.5 mm | Excellent — highest category |
| HDPE 1.0 mm | Very high |
| PVC 1.2 mm (plasticised) | Moderate — reduces over time as plasticiser depletes |
| SBS bitumen 4.0 mm (2-layer) | Moderate — effective when intact; reduces at cracks |
| Cementitious coating 2.0 mm | Low — significant radon transmission through micro-porosity |

For buildings in Portugal's granitic geological zones — the Norte, Beiras, and parts of the
Alentejo interior — specification of EPDM as the below-grade wall membrane provides dual
function waterproofing and radon protection in a single material layer.

Reference: Decreto-Lei 108/2018, which establishes the national radon action plan and reference
values for indoor radon concentrations (300 Bq/m³ as national reference level for existing
buildings; 200 Bq/m³ for new construction in high-risk zones).
