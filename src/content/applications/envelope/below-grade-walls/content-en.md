# Below-Grade Wall Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## The Environment Where Getting It Wrong Has No Second Chance

There is a fundamental difference between a wall exposed to the weather and a wall buried in
the ground. The exposed wall can be inspected, treated, repaired and, if necessary, stripped
and replaced. The buried wall cannot. Once the excavation is backfilled and the ground has
consolidated, the waterproofing membrane installed against its external face is inaccessible
for the remainder of the structure's service life — which in residential and civil construction
is typically 50 to 100 years.

This reality places below-grade walls in a category that is qualitatively different from every
other waterproofing application. A failure on a flat roof is costly and disruptive, but it is
remediable. A failure in a buried wall propagates silently for years — rising damp, efflorescence,
reinforcement corrosion, concrete deterioration, insulation contamination — until the problem
becomes structural and the cost of remediation is an order of magnitude greater than correctly
specified waterproofing would have cost from the outset.

Membriko works with EPDM membrane because, following rigorous assessment of every material
available for below-grade waterproofing, EPDM is the correct technical answer for this
environment. It is not the cheapest option. It is the option that performs for the duration
it must perform — without components that degrade, without plasticisers that migrate, without
double bonds in the main polymer chain for soil acids to attack. This page explains why, with
engineering depth and specificity to Portuguese ground conditions, so that any building owner,
architect, or engineer reading it has everything they need to make a fully informed decision.

## Why Below-Grade Moisture is an Entirely Different Problem

The moisture affecting buried walls does not behave like rain striking a façade. It is not
intermittent, not visible at its source, does not respond exclusively to gravity, and does
not stop when the sun appears. There are five distinct mechanisms by which water and vapour
reach a buried wall — and an adequate waterproofing system must resist all five simultaneously
and without interruption.

### Hydrostatic Pressure

When the groundwater table rises above the base of a buried wall, it exerts lateral pressure
against the exterior face. The physics is straightforward: each metre of water head above a
given point adds approximately 9.81 kPa of lateral pressure (0.098 bar). A basement with 2.5 m
of buried wall depth and a groundwater table 2 m above the base is subject to approximately
19.6 kPa of lateral pressure at the base of the wall — a continuous load the waterproofing
system must resist for decades without failure.

The European standard EN 1928 (Method B — watertightness under water pressure) tests EPDM
membranes to a minimum of 60 kPa, equivalent to a 6 m water column. This exceeds the
hydrostatic loading of the overwhelming majority of residential and commercial basements in
Portugal. Membriko specifies membranes tested to pressures corresponding to the design
hydrostatic head at each project — not a generic selection, but one based on the actual site
geometry and groundwater level.

In Portugal, the groundwater table is a determining factor across multiple zones: the alluvial
plains of the Tagus and Mondego (including the Pombal area), the high-rainfall Atlantic coast
of the north with 1,200 to 2,000 mm of annual precipitation, and the Algarve coastal zones
with shallow phreatic aquifers are all contexts where hydrostatic pressure on basement walls
is a permanent condition, not an occasional possibility.

### Capillary Suction

Capillary suction is the least intuitive and most frequently overlooked mechanism in
waterproofing specifications. In fine-grained soils — silts and clays — water migrates
laterally and upward through the pore structure of the soil by capillary forces, independently
of any positive groundwater head.

The height of capillary rise is inversely proportional to pore diameter: in the clay soils of
the Alentejo, it can exceed 15 metres. This means a buried wall in Alentejo clay is permanently
subject to capillary moisture, even in drought years when the groundwater table has dropped
tens of metres below foundation level. Many of the "dry in summer, damp in winter" basements
Membriko inspects are not affected by a rising water table — they are affected by the arrival
of the first autumn rains reactivating capillary suction in the dried soil.

EPDM has a water vapour diffusion resistance factor μ ≈ 35,000 — one of the highest values of
any flexible waterproofing membrane. The practical consequence is that vapour transmission
through a correctly installed EPDM membrane in normal below-grade conditions is essentially
zero. No capillary suction penetrates a Membriko system correctly installed and detailed.

### Water Vapour Transmission

Soil air is typically at 95-100% relative humidity. This warm, humid air exerts vapour pressure
against the exterior face of the wall, and water vapour migrates by diffusion through permeable
materials under the vapour pressure gradient — generating condensation on cold interior
surfaces even when no liquid water has penetrated.

This mechanism explains many situations where basement walls appear dry but interior finishes
suffer condensation, particularly in winter when the temperature difference between the heated
interior and the cool soil is at its maximum. A membrane with inadequate vapour resistance
does not resolve this problem even if it is theoretically watertight to liquid water.

### Soil Chemistry Attack

Soil is not chemically neutral. Depending on local geology, subsoil water and soil pore water
may contain:

- **Organic acids** (humic and fulvic acids from the decomposition of organic matter):
  significant concentrations in podzolic soils of the Pinhal de Leiria, forest soils of the
  north, and organic soils in wetland areas. These acids attack bituminous membranes through
  esterification and saponification of aromatic bitumen compounds.
- **Alkaline hydroxides** (calcium hydroxide leaching from Portland cement concrete, pH 11-12):
  maximum concentration at the concrete-membrane interface. These saponify SBS bituminous
  membranes over time, degrading the polymer modifier.
- **Sulphates** (soil classes DS-2 to DS-4 per EN 206): abundant in the clay soils of the
  Alentejo and in coastal zones with evaporitic deposits. Sulphates attack concrete (sulphate
  attack, gypsum formation, ettringite expansion). The EPDM membrane serves a dual function
  here: waterproofing the structure and acting as a chemical barrier protecting the concrete
  from sulphate ingress.
- **Chlorides** (saline groundwater in coastal zones): present in the coastal aquifers of the
  Algarve, the Alentejo coast, and estuarine zones of the Tagus and Sado rivers.

EPDM resists all of these agents without degradation. The saturated main chain of the polymer
has no ester groups, ether groups, or C=C double bonds for organic acids, alkaline hydroxides,
or sulphates to attack. This resistance is not derived from additives that deplete with time.
It is intrinsic to the molecular architecture of the material.

### Structural Movement and Cracking

Structural concrete is not permanently monolithic. Drying shrinkage after curing, creep under
sustained load, differential foundation settlement, seasonal thermal cycling, and the cyclic
opening of construction joints — all of these generate movement in the wall that the
waterproofing membrane must accommodate without rupture.

Shrinkage cracks in reinforced concrete walls typically have openings of 0.2 to 1.0 mm in new
construction; over the first ten years, they can widen to 1 to 5 mm under accumulated thermal
movement. A membrane with 30% elongation at break (APP-modified bitumen) or zero elongation
(cementitious coating) transmits these cracks directly to the interior. A membrane with 300 to
450% elongation (EPDM, typical values of the products Membriko specifies) bridges a 15-20 mm
crack without rupture, maintaining watertightness under all conditions.

## EPDM: The Chemistry of a Membrane Built for Below-Grade Conditions

The longevity of EPDM in buried environments is not a commercial promise. It is a direct
consequence of its molecular architecture — one that can be understood without advanced knowledge
of polymer chemistry.

### The Saturated Backbone: The Primary Reason

The main polymer chain of EPDM is composed of ethylene and propylene monomer units, linked
by saturated C-C and C-H bonds. These bonds contain no carbon-carbon double bonds. This fact
is decisive because:

- Atmospheric ozone attacks C=C double bonds through a mechanism called ozonolysis, which
  breaks polymer chains and causes characteristic surface cracking. EPDM has no double bonds
  in its main chain — its ozone resistance is absolute.
- Organic acids in soil attack ester and ether groups in polymer chains. The EPDM main chain
  has no such groups — its resistance to organic acids is intrinsic.
- UV photodegradation results from the absorption of high-energy photons by chromophoric groups
  in molecular chains. The saturated ethylene-propylene chain has minimal UV absorption —
  relevant to the membrane sections exposed to light in the transition zone between the buried
  and exposed conditions at the top of a buried wall.

### No Plasticisers: Permanent Flexibility

PVC requires plasticisers — phthalates or adipates at 20 to 40% by mass — to achieve the
flexibility needed for membrane application. These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to
the PVC matrix; they are physically dispersed within it and migrate progressively out over time
under the effects of temperature, pressure, water leaching, and concentration gradient.

EPDM requires no plasticisers. Its flexibility is intrinsic to the three-dimensional vulcanised
rubber network — a permanent structural property. An EPDM membrane installed today by
Membriko will have the same chemical composition and the same mechanical properties fifty
years from now. There is no component that migrates, evaporates, or becomes depleted.

### Vulcanisation and Permanent Elongation

The diene monomer (typically ENB — 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene) is incorporated into the EPDM
chain specifically to provide cross-linking sites during sulphur vulcanisation. Vulcanisation
converts the thermoplastic polymer into a three-dimensional elastomeric network — a thermoset
material with permanent elastic memory.

The practical result: after deformation of 300%, 400%, or even 500% of its original length,
EPDM returns to its original form without loss of mechanical properties. This permanent
elasticity, maintained across decades of service and across the full temperature range of -45°C
to +130°C, is what allows EPDM to bridge cracks in buried concrete walls without tearing —
and what distinguishes it from every alternative available in the Portuguese market.

### Carbon Black Loading: Reinforcement and Protection

Premium-grade EPDM membranes for below-grade applications incorporate carbon black at
30 to 40 parts per hundred rubber (phr). Carbon black serves multiple functions: it is the
primary mechanical reinforcement agent (increasing tensile and tear strength); it is an
effective UV absorber at the membrane surface (relevant at the grade transition zone); and it
contributes to the thermal conductivity of the material, distributing heat uniformly and
avoiding localised thermal hot spots.

## Below-Grade Wall Types: Identifying Your Application

Below-grade wall waterproofing is not a single solution. Membriko specifies systems adapted
to each wall typology and to the specific soil and groundwater conditions of each project.

### Basement Perimeter Walls

Reinforced concrete basement perimeter walls are the most common below-grade wall application
in Portugal. A typical residential basement has walls with 1.5 to 3.0 m of buried depth;
commercial urban basements may reach 4 to 6 m below exterior pavement level.

Membriko's application is made to the external face — positive-side application, on the
water-source side of the structure — before definitive backfilling. This position is technically
superior because:

1. Hydrostatic pressure presses the membrane against the wall, improving contact and preventing
   lateral water migration between the membrane and the substrate
2. The structural concrete is fully protected from water contact, acid attack, and carbonation
   throughout its service life
3. Cracks that develop in the concrete after construction are bridged by the membrane without
   water ingress

The critical details in basement wall waterproofing are: continuity at the wall-to-base slab
construction joint; termination at grade level; and penetrations for pipework and conduits.
Membriko uses pre-formed EPDM accessories for all these details — internal and external corner
pieces, pipe boots, mechanical termination bars — eliminating the complex geometry that
field-formed flashings produce with variable results.

### Retaining Walls

Retaining walls in Portugal span an enormous range of applications: from agricultural terracing
in the Douro and Alentejo (where stone and concrete walls of 0.5 to 2.0 m retain vineyard
and olive grove terraces) to reinforced concrete cantilever walls of 3 to 8 m height used in
road infrastructure and urban construction on sloped plots.

Retaining wall waterproofing has a specific characteristic: the face to be waterproofed is
the buried face (the retained-earth side), but the load is not only hydrostatic — it is the
combination of hydrostatic pressure and earth pressure (at-rest or active pressure, depending
on wall stiffness and permitted deformation).

Membriko's standard specification for retaining walls is 1.5 mm EPDM with a geocomposite
drainage board installed between the membrane and the backfilled soil. The geocomposite
performs three simultaneous functions: mechanical protection of the membrane during backfilling,
drainage of infiltrating water down its cuspated core to the base perimeter drain, and filtration
of fine soil particles through its geotextile facing to prevent drainage system clogging.

In Portugal's seismic zones — particularly the Algarve and southern Alentejo (Zone A under
Eurocode 8, NP EN 1998-5), and Zones B and C in the centre and north — EPDM's elongation of
≥ 300% (typically 400%) gives the system the capacity to absorb the cyclic movements imposed by
seismic events without permanent deformation. A bituminous membrane, more rigid and viscoelastic,
accumulates permanent deformation under repeated dynamic loading cycles.

### Earth-Sheltered Buildings and Buried Landscape Structures

Earth-sheltered construction — buildings partially or fully buried in a hillside or beneath a
landscaped soil cover — is a growing typology in Portugal, particularly in rural tourism and
in high-value private housing in regions such as the Alentejo and the Beira Interior.

In this typology, the demands on the envelope waterproofing membrane are the most severe:

- **High overburden load**: 0.5 to 3.0 m of saturated soil represents 10 to 60 kN/m² of
  vertical pressure on the buried roof element, in addition to lateral pressure on the walls
- **Root resistance**: vegetation growing in the soil cover develops roots that follow moisture
  gradients directly to the membrane surface
- **Sustained hydrostatic head**: saturated soil maintains a permanent water column above and
  against the membrane

EPDM is the only single membrane material that addresses all three requirements simultaneously.
Its root resistance is certified to the FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung
Landschaftsbau) standard and EN 13948 — the same test used for green roof applications, where
Membriko has extensive installation experience. The same membrane that protects a 500 m²
green roof in Lisbon is appropriate for the buried envelope of an earth-sheltered building
in the Alentejo.

## Hydrostatic Pressure and Capillary Suction: Quantitative Analysis

### Hydrostatic Pressure Profiles for Portuguese Construction

Membriko specifies EPDM thickness based on the design hydrostatic load of each project —
not generically. Typical profiles for Portuguese construction:

**Residential basement in Porto (granitic soil regime, north):** Winter water table typically
at 0.5 to 1.5 m below surface; seasonal fluctuation of 1 to 2 metres. A basement with 2.5 m
of buried wall depth may have the water table within the wall height for 3 to 5 months per
year. Peak hydrostatic pressure at base: 10 to 15 kPa. Standard specification: EPDM 1.0-1.5 mm
with peripheral drain.

**Commercial basement in Lisbon (alluvial plain, Tagus zone):** Permanent water table at 1 to
3 m depth in alluvial zones. A basement at 4 m depth will have 1 to 3 m of permanent hydrostatic
head. Pressure at base: 10 to 30 kPa. Specification: EPDM 1.5 mm with peripheral drainage
system and geocomposite board.

**Underground car park in the Algarve (coastal zone, saline aquifer):** Permanent water table
at 1 to 4 m depth; saline groundwater in coastal intrusion zones. Hydrostatic pressure to 30-40 kPa;
additional chemical aggressiveness. Specification: EPDM 1.5-2.0 mm with reinforced protection
and drainage.

### Capillary Rise in Portuguese Soils

Capillary rise height (h) in soils is approximately h = 30/d₁₀ (in metres, where d₁₀ is the
particle size below which 10% of particles fall by mass). For representative Portuguese soils:

- Coarse gravel (d₁₀ = 2 mm): h ≈ 0.15 m — negligible
- Fine sand (d₁₀ = 0.1 mm): h ≈ 0.3 m — low
- Silt (d₁₀ = 0.01 mm): h ≈ 3 m — significant
- Clay (d₁₀ = 0.002 mm): h ≈ 15+ m — dominant; capillary suction governs the moisture regime

In the granitic silts of northern Portugal and the clay soils of the Alentejo — which together
cover vast areas of the national territory — capillary suction acts across the full height of
buried walls, regardless of the groundwater table level. Membriko accounts for this mechanism
in every system specification, ensuring that the EPDM membrane and the complementary drainage
system eliminate capillary moisture as effectively as they eliminate direct hydrostatic pressure.

## The Membriko Method: External Application in Six Stages

Membriko's below-grade wall waterproofing follows a six-stage sequential process. Every stage
has a specific technical function. This is not a marketing framework — it is the operational
sequence that produces a consistently documented, verifiable, and warranted result.

### Stage 1: Technical Assessment and Design

Before any installation begins, Membriko carries out a free technical site visit. This is a
structured engineering assessment, not a sales call. It includes:

- Analysis of local geology and groundwater level, with reference to any available borehole
  logs or, where necessary, simple field tests (infiltration test, groundwater level in
  adjacent wells or drainage channels)
- Visual inspection of the structure: identification of cracks, construction joints,
  penetrations, and any existing waterproofing system
- Assessment of excavation access for external membrane application
- Soil chemistry assessment based on local geology: identification of organic acid risk,
  sulphate class, alkalinity, salinity
- System specification: membrane thickness, adhesive or self-adhesive system, protection
  board, drainage design, treatment for every singular point

The technical report from this visit forms the basis of the proposal presented to the client.
Membriko does not issue proposals without a prior site visit — every proposal is specific to
each wall and each set of site conditions.

### Stage 2: Substrate Preparation

The quality of the waterproofing is limited by the quality of the substrate. For concrete walls,
preparation includes:

- Full cleaning: removal of formwork residue, release oil, surface laitance, and contaminants
- Crack repair: epoxy resin injection for structural cracks; mortar filling for surface
  imperfections
- Treatment of honeycombed zones: filling with repair mortar to produce a monolithic surface
- For masonry walls (common in retrofit applications): application of a polymer-modified
  mortar render coat (minimum 15 mm thickness) to create a continuous, smooth surface before
  membrane adhesion

Membriko systematically checks substrate pull-off strength (EN 12188 test, minimum 0.08 N/mm²
for bonded application) and moisture content before any adhesive is applied.

### Stage 3: EPDM Membrane Application

The membrane is applied in panels of maximum possible width — EPDM rolls are available up to
15.25 metres wide — to minimise seam count. For simply shaped walls, a single roll width can
cover the entire developed wall height without an intermediate seam. For complex geometries,
cutting patterns are developed before installation begins, with each panel cut to dimension and
labelled before laying.

Panel-to-panel joints are made with QuickSeam tape (minimum 75 mm bonded overlap width) and
QuickPrime Plus primer, applied to manufacturer specification, with uniform compression by
silicone roller to ensure full contact without air pockets. All seams are checked with a metal
probe after cure.

Where a bonded installation is specified, Membriko uses neoprene-base contact adhesive or
self-adhesive EPDM systems with factory-applied adhesive protected by a release liner. Self-
adhesive systems eliminate adhesive open-time management and produce more consistent bond
quality, particularly on vertical surfaces where applying liquid adhesive and controlling contact
timing is more demanding.

### Stage 4: Singular Point Treatment

Singular points are the highest-risk locations in below-grade wall waterproofing. Membriko
treats each one with pre-formed EPDM accessories from the same manufacturer as the sheet
membrane, ensuring chemical compatibility and uniform elasticity:

- **Wall-to-slab construction joint**: The internal angle between the wall and the base slab
  is the location of greatest stress concentration and greatest frequency of structural cracking.
  Membriko installs a pre-formed EPDM internal corner piece, overlapping and bonded to both the
  wall membrane and the slab membrane, ensuring continuity without manual corner deformation.
- **Pipe and conduit penetrations**: Each pipe or conduit passing through the buried wall is
  sealed with a pre-formed EPDM pipe boot, dimensioned to the pipe diameter, bonded to the wall
  membrane and mechanically clamped over the pipe with a stainless-steel compression band.
- **Grade-level termination**: The EPDM membrane is terminated above exterior ground level at
  a mechanical termination bar fixed to the concrete with stainless-steel anchors, with the upper
  edge sealed with polyurethane sealant compatible with EPDM. This termination prevents surface
  water from infiltrating behind the membrane at the soil-to-surface transition zone.

### Stage 5: Protection Board and Drainage System Installation

Immediately after membrane and singular point completion — before any backfilling commences —
Membriko installs the protection board and drainage system:

- **Geocomposite drainage board**: a prefabricated panel with an HDPE cuspated drainage core
  and a bonded geotextile filter facing. Installed against the external face of the EPDM
  membrane, from the top of the buried wall to the base perimeter drain. Performs three
  simultaneous functions: mechanical protection of the membrane during backfilling; drainage of
  infiltrating water down the cuspated core to the perimeter drain; filtration of soil fines
  through the geotextile facing.
- **Perimeter French drain**: perforated PVC or PE pipe, minimum 150 mm diameter, laid at the
  base of the wall foundation in a free-draining granular bed (20-40 mm washed aggregate)
  wrapped in a geotextile filter. The drain collects water arriving at the base of the membrane
  and routes it by gravity to an external outlet point or to a sump chamber.

### Stage 6: Controlled Backfilling and Final Quality Control

Backfilling is carried out in controlled lifts using selected fill material — free from angular
elements that could damage the protection board — and compacted in a manner that does not
generate excessive pressures on the membrane before ground consolidation is established.
Membriko remains on site during backfilling and inspects the protection board condition at
each lift.

Final quality control includes:
- Visual inspection of all seams and visible singular points before backfilling commences
- Metal probe check of all accessible seams
- Systematic photographic record of the entire installed membrane before it becomes inaccessible
- For larger or higher-risk projects: Electronic Leak Detection (ELD) survey using low-voltage
  current applied across the membrane surface, identifying any defect location with millimetre
  precision before backfilling makes remediation difficult

---

## Drainage Layer Integration: System Thinking, Not Just Membrane Thinking

Membriko specifies and installs below-grade wall waterproofing as an integrated system —
membrane plus drainage — not as a membrane in isolation. This system perspective is fundamental
because correct drainage reduces the hydrostatic load on the membrane and extends the overall
safety margin of the system even in the face of minor installation imperfections.

### Peripheral Drainage System

The standard peripheral drainage system for Portuguese below-grade construction:
- Perimeter French drain at foundation base level (perforated pipe in granular bed with
  geotextile wrapping)
- Drainage layer along the wall face (free-draining gravel or geocomposite drainage board)
- Drain outlet to surface drainage or to a sump chamber

A correctly dimensioned peripheral drain — sized for peak flow rates based on local rainfall
and soil permeability — can reduce the design hydrostatic column from 2-3 metres to near-zero
in permeable soils. Membriko sizes the peripheral drain based on calculated peak drainage
flow, not standard diameters applied without verification.

### Geocomposite Drainage Board

The geocomposite drainage board is Membriko's standard specification for new below-grade wall
construction. It is a prefabricated panel combining:
- HDPE drainage core: drainage capacity 1.0 to 3.5 l/m·s (product-dependent)
- Bonded geotextile filter facing: filtration opening < 0.1 mm, preventing soil migration
  into the drainage core

Installed across the full height of the buried wall, it provides simultaneously the protection,
drainage, and filtration functions that alternative approaches achieve only with multiple
separate layers and greater installation complexity.

### Sump and Pump System

Where gravity discharge of the peripheral drain is not possible — below-valley basements,
deep urban basements, artesian groundwater zones — Membriko designs and specifies an
underground sump chamber with submersible pump. Pump sizing is based on estimated infiltration
flow rate (derived from soil permeability, buried wall area, and hydrostatic head) with pump
redundancy for service continuity in the event of mechanical failure.

## EPDM vs Competing Systems for Below-Grade Walls

### EPDM vs SBS and APP Modified Bitumen

Modified bituminous membranes (SBS and APP) dominate below-grade waterproofing in Portugal
by volume, driven by installer familiarity and lower initial material cost. The technical
comparison for long-duration below-grade service is unfavourable to bitumen on multiple
dimensions.

**Crack bridging**: EPDM at 300-450% elongation bridges concrete cracks of 5 to 20 mm without
rupture. SBS bitumen at 150-250% elongation and APP bitumen at 30-100% have substantially
lower crack-bridging capacity. Concrete shrinkage cracks in the first decade of a structure's
life typically have openings of 0.5 to 5 mm — within EPDM's capacity, at or beyond the limit
of bituminous capacity.

**Alkaline environment**: SBS bitumen is susceptible to saponification in strongly alkaline
environments (pH > 10), the condition created at the concrete-membrane interface by calcium
hydroxide leaching from Portland cement concrete throughout the structure's life. EPDM is
chemically inert at any pH between 2 and 14.

**Organic acid environment**: SBS and APP bitumen are degraded by humic acids in organic soils.
This is a direct risk in construction adjacent to the Pinhal de Leiria, where foundations are
in contact with organic acid-rich podzolic soils. EPDM is fully resistant.

**Root penetration**: Bituminous membranes are recognised as susceptible to penetration by
tree and shrub roots in buried environments, which follow moisture gradients. EPDM passes the
FLL root penetration test without modification.

**Service life**: Independent assessments project EPDM at 50+ years below-grade. Modified
bituminous membranes are assessed at 20-35 years in equivalent conditions, constrained by
the degradation mechanisms described above.

### EPDM vs Cementitious Waterproofing

Cementitious waterproofing systems — crystalline admixtures (Xypex, Sika Crystallia, Penetron),
two-component cement-based coatings, and polymer-modified cementitious slurries — are widely
used in Portugal, particularly in concrete rehabilitation and in reinforcement of existing
structures.

**Crack bridging**: Cementitious systems have zero to 2% elongation. Any crack wider than
approximately 0.1 mm (rigid coatings) or 0.4-0.5 mm (crystalline systems) propagates directly
through the waterproofing layer. EPDM bridges cracks of 15-20 mm width across the membrane
plane without rupture.

**Surface compatibility**: Cementitious systems bond only to concrete or masonry. They cannot
waterproof expansion joints, pipe penetrations, or transitions between different substrate
materials. EPDM, with appropriate primers, adheres to and waterproofs concrete, masonry, steel
pipes, PVC conduits, and mixed-material substrates.

**Positive versus negative side**: Cementitious systems can be applied on the negative (interior)
side, which makes them the correct solution for existing basement remediation where exterior
access is not achievable. Membriko acknowledges this advantage honestly and recommends
cementitious solutions when circumstances require it — EPDM is not the answer to every situation.

**Service life**: Cementitious coatings require attention to the polymer-modified component at
15-25 years in active groundwater environments. Crystalline systems are more durable but remain
limited by their zero crack-bridging capability. EPDM's 50+ year below-grade service life
compares favourably.

### EPDM vs HDPE Geomembranes

HDPE geomembranes are used in civil engineering containment applications and occasionally
specified for building foundation waterproofing.

**Elasticity versus plastic deformation**: HDPE has high elongation at break (700-800%) but
a low yield strain (12-18%). Beyond yield, HDPE undergoes permanent plastic deformation —
stress whitening, localised thinning — and does not return to its original dimensions. In
practice, HDPE's effective crack-bridging capacity in building service conditions is limited
to strains below its yield point. EPDM maintains full elastic recovery throughout its 300-450%
elongation range: it returns to its original shape after any deformation within this range.

**Seam execution**: HDPE requires extrusion or hot-wedge thermal welding — a specialised
technique requiring portable welding equipment and operator certification. EPDM seams use
QuickSeam tape and primer — simpler, faster, and more reliably executable in a building
contractor context without specialised welding equipment.

## Radon and Soil Gas: The Secondary Benefit That Matters in Portugal

Portugal has one of the highest measured average indoor radon concentrations in Europe, with
particularly elevated values in regions with granitic geology: Norte (Minho, Trás-os-Montes),
Beiras (Beira Alta and Beira Interior), the Serra da Estrela, and granite outcrops in the
interior Alentejo.

Radon (²²²Rn) is a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium-238
in granitic rocks. It migrates upward through soil pore spaces and enters buildings through
cracks and imperfections in floor slabs and in walls at ground contact. Decreto-Lei 108/2018
establishes the Portuguese national radon action plan, setting reference levels of 300 Bq/m³
for existing buildings and 200 Bq/m³ for new construction in high-risk municipalities.

Membriko specifies EPDM in below-grade walls in radon-risk areas with a clear understanding
of the dual function the system provides:

**Waterproofing**: resistance to groundwater infiltration through the full thickness of the
buried wall.

**Radon barrier**: vulcanised EPDM has an extremely low radon diffusion coefficient — comparable
to HDPE geomembranes, which are among the most effective barrier materials available. The dense
three-dimensional network of the vulcanised elastomer has low free volume and high chain density,
limiting the diffusion of heavy gases such as radon.

The comparison with alternative systems is instructive:
- EPDM 1.5 mm: excellent radon barrier — dense polymer network without continuous diffusion
  pathways
- HDPE 1.0 mm: very good — comparable to EPDM
- Plasticised PVC 1.2 mm: moderate — effectiveness reduces as plasticiser migrates and creates
  diffusion pathways
- SBS bitumen 4.0 mm (two-layer): moderate — effective when intact; reduced at any crack
- Cementitious coating 2.0 mm: low — cement microporosity allows significant gas diffusion

For new buildings in high-risk radon municipalities — identified under Decreto-Lei 108/2018
and in LNEC publications — specifying EPDM as the below-grade wall and floor membrane provides
a technically complete response to the radon barrier requirement, without a separate additional
gas barrier layer.

## Portuguese Ground Conditions: Regional Knowledge

Membriko is based in Pombal — at the geographical centre of Portugal — and operates across
the entire national territory. Our knowledge of regional soil and groundwater conditions is
part of the technical service we provide, not background information we outsource to geotechnical
consultants.

### Norte (Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Douro)

Granitic and schistose soils, high rainfall (1,200 to 2,000 mm per year), shallow impermeable
horizons that create perched water tables during wet periods. Significant concentrations of
humic acids in podzolic forest soils (pine and eucalyptus plantations that cover large areas
of the north).

**Primary challenge**: chemical aggressiveness (organic acids, moderately acidic pH) combined
with hydrostatic cycles of large seasonal amplitude.

**EPDM response**: complete resistance to organic acids; elasticity that accommodates seasonal
loading and unloading cycles without fatigue.

### Centro (Beira Litoral, Estremadura — including Pombal and Leiria)

Mixed regime: Jurassic limestone formations, alluvial plains of the Mondego, Lis, and Nabão
rivers, and podzolic soils of the Pinhal de Leiria forest. The Pombal area sits at the
interface of calcareous formations and alluvial zones — foundations at 1.0-2.5 m depth in
alluvial areas frequently encounter the permanent water table. This is Membriko's home
territory, and our team has direct field experience with the specific soil and groundwater
conditions of this region.

**Primary challenge**: the dual aggressiveness of alkaline groundwater (from limestone and
concrete-adjacent soils) and organic acid environments (from the Pinhal de Leiria podzols),
with a permanent water table in alluvial zones.

**EPDM response**: resistant to both pH extremes simultaneously — alkaline and acidic
conditions are equally handled by the saturated polymer backbone.

### Alentejo

Deep clay soils, low rainfall (500-700 mm per year), large seasonal variation in the water
table. In summer the table may drop 10-15 m; winter recharge in clay-heavy areas can raise it
to within 1-2 m of the surface. Expansive Alentejo clays exert lateral pressures on buried
walls that vary with moisture content — adding an expansion pressure component to the membrane
load profile.

**Primary challenge**: large-amplitude hydrostatic cycling (zero to design pressure) combined
with variable earth pressure from clay expansion and shrinkage.

**EPDM response**: elastic recovery maintains the waterproof seal through repeated loading and
unloading cycles; no permanent deformation accumulates even after hundreds of seasonal cycles.

### Algarve and the Coast

Low rainfall (400-600 mm per year) but intensively exploited coastal aquifers, with saltwater
intrusion in coastal zones. The water table in riverside and coastal areas (Guadiana, Arade
estuary zones) may be permanently at or near the surface. Subsoil temperatures are marginally
higher in summer at shallow depth (surface soil temperatures to 35-40°C in the top metre) but
well within EPDM's service limit of +130°C.

**Primary challenge**: chloride salinity of groundwater in coastal intrusion zones.

**EPDM response**: fully resistant to sodium chloride at any concentration, including full
seawater salinity (35 g/L NaCl). No degradation mechanism is activated by chloride exposure.

## Regulatory Framework

Membriko specifies and installs below-grade wall waterproofing systems in compliance with
the applicable European and Portuguese regulatory framework. Understanding this framework is
part of the service we provide to clients — ensuring that the installed system meets all
requirements and that the documentation exists to demonstrate compliance.

### European Standards

**EN 13967 — Flexible sheets for waterproofing — Plastic and rubber damp proof courses
including plastics and rubber damp proof courses**: The primary European harmonised standard
for membranes used in below-grade applications (foundations, buried walls, tunnels). Defines
minimum performance requirements for thickness, tensile strength, elongation, watertightness,
chemical resistance, and tear strength. EPDM membranes specified by Membriko for below-grade
applications carry CE marking under EN 13967 with a Declaration of Performance confirming
declared characteristics.

**EN 1928 — Determination of watertightness — Method B (water under pressure)**: The reference
watertightness test method for below-grade waterproofing membranes. Membriko specifies
membranes tested at pressures corresponding to the design hydrostatic head at each project.

**EN 14909 — Flexible sheets for waterproofing — Plastic and rubber wall and floor joints**:
Relevant for the junction details between wall membrane and floor membrane at the construction
joint.

**EN 1997-1 / NP EN 1997-1 (Eurocode 7 — Geotechnical Design)**: Reference standard for
foundation and retaining structure design in Portugal. Defines earth pressure calculation
methods and drainage requirements.

**NP EN 1998-5 (Eurocode 8 — Geotechnical aspects of seismic design)**: Applicable to retaining
walls and basement structures in Portugal's seismic zones. EPDM's ≥ 300% elongation and full
elastic recovery make it the appropriate choice for structures in seismic zones subject to
cyclic deformation.

### Portuguese National Regulations

**RGEU Article 96**: Requires buildings to be protected against humidity and groundwater
infiltration. Does not prescribe method or material but establishes the performance obligation.
EPDM installed to Membriko's specification meets this obligation with a documented 50+ year
service life.

**Decreto-Lei 108/2018**: National radon action plan. In new buildings in high-risk
municipalities, below-grade construction elements must include adequate barriers to radon
diffusion. EPDM meets this requirement, providing both waterproofing and radon barrier function
in a single membrane layer.

**LNEC technical specifications**: Membriko maintains current knowledge of relevant LNEC
(Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) specifications for waterproofing in civil structures,
ensuring installation procedures are aligned with both European harmonised standards and
national technical requirements.

## Retrofit Waterproofing: Existing Below-Grade Walls with Moisture Problems

The majority of Portuguese buildings constructed before 1990 have inadequate or failed
below-grade wall waterproofing — or systems that have reached the end of their service life.
Retrofit waterproofing of damp basements and moisture-affected buried walls is among the most
frequent applications Membriko addresses.

### The Retrofit Diagnosis

The first step is always diagnosis. Membriko carries out a technical visit to identify:

- The source of the moisture: direct infiltration under hydrostatic pressure? Capillary suction?
  Condensation? Surface water infiltration at the sill junction? Each source has a different
  solution.
- The condition of any existing waterproofing: bonded or loose? Blistered? Delaminating?
  Cracked? The condition of existing waterproofing determines whether it can serve as a
  substrate for a new system or must be removed.
- External excavation access: is it possible to excavate to access the external wall face?

### Where External Excavation is Achievable (EPDM Application)

Where excavation is possible to access the external face of the buried wall, Membriko installs
EPDM in conditions and to a performance standard identical to new construction:

- Removal of any defective existing waterproofing
- Structural crack repair
- EPDM installation on the external face, with all singular points treated with pre-formed
  accessories
- Geocomposite board and peripheral drain installation
- Controlled backfilling

The expected outcome is watertightness equivalent to a new installation, with a 20-year
Membriko installation warranty.

### Where External Excavation is Not Possible (Honest Advice on Alternatives)

In densely constrained urban basements, buildings with shared party walls, listed structures,
or situations where excavation is structurally impractical, external EPDM application is not
feasible. Membriko acknowledges this limitation with complete honesty and does not propose
EPDM where it is not the technically correct answer.

For these situations, there are alternative solutions that Membriko can recommend and, in some
cases, coordinate:

- **Cavity drain membrane system (studded HDPE sheet)**: applied to the internal face of the
  wall, creating a managed drainage cavity between the wall and the interior finish. A water
  management rather than water exclusion approach. Appropriate for basements used as storage
  or car parking where some residual moisture in the structure is acceptable.
- **Crystalline waterproofing injection**: crystalline products injected into the concrete form
  insoluble crystals in the pore structure, reducing permeability. Effective for hairline cracks
  (< 0.4 mm); limited for structural cracks wider than 0.5 mm.
- **Internal polymer-modified cementitious coating**: two-component waterproofing mortar applied
  to the interior face. Negative-side application with lower robustness than external membrane,
  but achievable without excavation.

Signs that a retrofit is needed and that immediate consultation is advisable:
- Damp patches on internal wall finishes, particularly at or below grade level
- White efflorescence deposits on interior wall surfaces (mineral salts carried by migrating
  moisture)
- Standing water on the basement floor after rainfall or seasonal water table rise
- Biological growth (mould, mildew) on interior wall surfaces near the floor
- Rust staining visible through the wall face (indicating reinforcement corrosion in progress)

## Maintenance and Whole-Life Value

One of the most important arguments for specifying EPDM in below-grade walls is what does not
need to be done during the building's service life.

**What a buried EPDM membrane does not require:**
- No routine inspection (it is inaccessible — and it does not need to be inspected)
- No recoating cycles (unlike epoxy or polyurethane coatings)
- No replacement at years 15-20 (unlike bituminous systems under Portuguese ground conditions)
- No seam re-welding (unlike HDPE)

**What a buried EPDM membrane requires:**
- Annual inspection of visible elements: grade-level termination, polyurethane sealant at
  the termination bar, peripheral drain outlet function, sump pump operation (where installed)
- Polyurethane sealant renewal at the grade-level termination every 10-15 years, as assessed
  at annual inspection

The lifecycle cost comparison with alternative systems is compelling. Consider a 200 m² basement
wall waterproofing project with a 50-year analysis horizon:

- **APP bituminous membrane** (lower initial cost): requires complete replacement at years 20-25
  under Portuguese ground chemistry conditions, with significant disruption and excavation cost.
  Total 50-year cost: initial installation plus one or two complete replacements plus
  maintenance — approximately 2 to 3 times the initial installation cost.
- **EPDM membrane** (higher initial cost): requires no replacement within a 50-year horizon.
  Annual inspection and sealant renewal every 10-15 years. Total 50-year cost: initial
  installation plus minimal maintenance — the lowest total cost of any competing system over
  any analysis period exceeding 25 years.

Membriko offers a maintenance programme for all projects it installs: annual technical inspection
of accessible elements, written condition report, and any necessary minor sealant remediation
included in the visit. The cost is fixed and predictable — unlike the unpredictable emergency
costs of an active water ingress event.

## Why Membriko

There is no shortage of contractors who will apply a membrane to a buried wall. The critical
question is not who will apply it — it is who will apply it correctly: with the right material
for the specific soil chemistry and hydrostatic conditions, with the substrate preparation that
the adhesion system requires, with the singular point details treated with pre-formed certified
accessories, and with the drainage system integrated from the design stage.

Membriko was established with a single technical focus: professional EPDM membrane application
across Portugal. We do not install windows, paint walls, or lay floor tiles. We apply EPDM —
and within that specialisation, we work on below-grade walls, basements, retaining walls, and
earth-sheltered buildings with the same rigour we apply to roofing and water containment.

Our base in Pombal places us at the geographical centre of Portugal, within practical operational
reach of every point in the national territory — from the Minho to the Algarve, from the
Atlantic coast to the Spanish border. Membriko has installed EPDM on residential basement walls
in Lisbon, underground car parks in Porto, retaining walls for rural tourism projects in the
Alentejo, and earth-sheltered buildings in the Beira Interior. Every project receives the same
process, the same material standards, and the same warranty.

The materials Membriko specifies carry CE marking under EN 13967 and are supplied with
Declarations of Performance confirming tested characteristics. We do not source membranes on
lowest price. We source on documented performance, because our 20-year warranty is dependent
on membrane performance — and our reputation is staked on both.

When you engage Membriko for a below-grade wall waterproofing project, you receive: a free
technical assessment with no obligation; a detailed written proposal with explicit material and
method specification; transparent pricing without hidden contingencies; installation by trained
technicians using calibrated equipment; quality control documentation; a 20-year written
warranty; and access to Membriko's maintenance programme for the life of the installation.

Contact Membriko to arrange a site assessment. We will evaluate your situation, explain your
options, and give you the information you need to make an informed decision. No pressure, no
commitment — just a professional technical diagnosis from Portugal's EPDM waterproofing
specialists.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can EPDM be applied to existing stone or brick masonry walls?**

Yes, with appropriate substrate preparation. Old stone or masonry walls — common in
basement rehabilitation in buildings constructed before 1970 — require a polymer-modified
mortar render coat to create a smooth, continuous, and structurally sound surface before EPDM
adhesion. Minimum render thickness is 15 mm; the render must cure fully (minimum 28 days)
before any adhesive or membrane is applied. Membriko assesses substrate suitability and the
need for prior rendering during the technical diagnostic visit.

**What is the difference between positive-side and negative-side waterproofing for buried walls?**

Positive-side waterproofing — applying EPDM to the external face of the wall, between the
soil and the structure — is the technically superior approach. Hydrostatic pressure presses
the membrane against the wall, improving contact; the concrete is protected from chemical
attack throughout its service life; and cracks that develop in the concrete after construction
are bridged by the membrane without infiltration. Negative-side application (interior) is the
correct approach when external excavation access is not achievable — but it is a moisture
management solution, not moisture exclusion. Membriko is transparent about this distinction
in every consultation.

**Does EPDM resist tree and shrub roots near basement walls?**

Yes. EPDM passes the FLL root penetration test (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung
Landschaftsbau) — the same standard used for green roof membranes, which are in permanent
contact with plant roots. This resistance is intrinsic to the material, not an additional
protective coating that can be abraded or penetrated. Bituminous membranes do not reliably
pass this test, representing a genuine long-term risk adjacent to landscaped areas with trees
and shrubs. Membriko specifies FLL-certified EPDM on all projects where root presence is a
risk factor.

**Is a peripheral drain necessary in addition to the EPDM membrane?**

In most Portuguese below-grade conditions, yes. A peripheral drainage system reduces the
hydrostatic head on the membrane — potentially from several metres to near-zero in permeable
soils — and represents the correct integrated approach to below-grade waterproofing. A membrane
without drainage bears the full design hydrostatic load. In low-permeability soils where drainage
has limited effectiveness, the EPDM membrane (specified for the design pressure) is the primary
protective element, but drainage is still recommended to reduce seasonal flooding risk. Membriko
assesses drainage need and sizing in every project during the design stage.

**What happens if the membrane is accidentally punctured during backfilling?**

EPDM can be repaired on site using patch pieces, QuickSeam tape, and primer. Any puncture
identified before backfilling commences is repaired by Membriko's team before filling resumes.
After backfilling, any detected leak requires localised excavation to access the membrane —
which is why the protection board between the membrane and the backfill is mandatory on all
Membriko projects. The protection board prevents the vast majority of mechanical damage during
the backfilling stage. On higher-risk projects, Membriko carries out ELD (Electronic Leak
Detection) survey before backfilling, locating any defect with millimetre precision while
the membrane is still accessible.

**Does EPDM act as a radon barrier for basement walls in Portugal's risk zones?**

Yes. Vulcanised EPDM has radon diffusion resistance comparable to HDPE geomembranes — among
the most effective barrier materials available for below-grade applications. The dense three-
dimensional polymer network of the vulcanised elastomer has low free volume, limiting the
diffusion of heavy gases including radon. In the granitic regions of northern Portugal and
the Beiras, and in granitic outcrops of the interior Alentejo — high-risk zones under Decreto-Lei
108/2018 — EPDM below-grade wall waterproofing provides dual protection against groundwater
and radon in a single membrane layer, without the need for a separate gas barrier installation.

**What EPDM thickness should I specify for a basement with the water table at 3 m depth?**

With the groundwater table 3 m above the base of the wall, hydrostatic pressure at the base
is approximately 29.4 kPa. Standard 1.5 mm EPDM — tested to EN 1928 Method B at 60 kPa —
is adequate for this pressure with significant safety margin. For water tables more than 5 m
above the wall base, or where soil chemistry is aggressive (high organic acids, sulphates,
chlorides), Membriko specifies 2.0 mm. Membriko provides a written thickness specification
with every proposal, based on the specific hydrostatic and soil chemistry conditions of each
project — not a standard selection independent of site conditions.

**Can Membriko waterproof existing basement walls without excavation?**

EPDM application to buried walls requires access to the external face — which means excavation.
Where excavation is structurally or practically impossible (tightly constrained urban sites,
shared party walls, listed buildings), external EPDM application is not viable. Membriko is
direct about this limitation and does not propose EPDM for situations where it is not the
technically correct answer. For these situations, we can recommend and coordinate alternative
internal solutions — cavity drain systems, crystalline injection, or internal cementitious
coatings — depending on the specific conditions of each project and the client's performance
requirements.
