# Planter Box and Raised Bed Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane — Complete Membriko Guide

## 1. Introduction: Built-in Planters on Buildings — The Hidden Problem

A built-in planter on a terrace, rooftop or facade looks, at first glance, like a simple element. It is a box with soil and plants. But for any professional with experience in building pathologies, the structural planter is something quite different: it is one of the highest-risk points for water infiltration in the entire building envelope.

The reason is straightforward. A structural planter combines, simultaneously, three of the most aggressive threats to any waterproofing system: actively growing roots that seek moisture and nutrients along any imperfection in the membrane; fertilisers, herbicides and fungicides that chemically degrade materials not designed to resist them; and permanent moisture — not occasional rain, but the continuous presence of damp substrate in direct contact with the waterproofing for decades.

Place these three factors within a geometrically complex structure — with interior corners, exterior corners, base drains and edge upstands — directly above an occupied space or structurally sensitive element, and you will understand why Membriko approaches planter waterproofing with the same technical rigour applied to a flat roof or a swimming pool.

Membriko, based in Pombal and operating across Portugal, specifies exclusively EPDM membrane for built-in planters and planting boxes. Not for commercial convenience, but because EPDM is the only material that adequately addresses all technical requirements of this application: natural FLL-certified root resistance, complete chemical inertness to fertilisers and pesticides, and the flexibility to form complex three-dimensional geometries without compromising watertightness.

This guide explains, with the technical depth that Membriko applies in every project, why planters fail, what prevents failure, and how EPDM has become the reference standard for planter and raised bed waterproofing throughout Portugal and across Europe.

## 2. Why EPDM Is the Right Membrane for Planters

### Natural Root Resistance — FLL Certification Without Biocides

The core technical argument for EPDM in planters is its natural resistance to root penetration. EPDM is a vulcanised synthetic rubber with a densely cross-linked molecular structure. The three-dimensional network of carbon-carbon bonds created by vulcanisation is physically impenetrable to root tips — no chemical treatment, no biocidal additives, no performance that degrades with time.

The certification that validates this property is the FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau), the German landscape research institute that publishes internationally recognised guidelines for waterproofing in contact with vegetation. The FLL root penetration test, standardised as EN 13948, exposes the membrane to direct contact with aggressive root species (Agropyron repens and Quercus robur) for a minimum of 24 months — two complete growing seasons. EPDM passes this test consistently with no evidence of penetration.

Membriko uses exclusively FLL-verified EPDM membrane in all built-in planters and raised beds. This is not a shelf product choice — it is a technically documented guarantee that the installed membrane resists the ornamental species common in Portuguese landscaping projects.

Alternative membranes — flexible PVC, modified bituminous, TPO — require biocidal additives (typically mecoprop or pendimethalin) incorporated into the formulation to resist roots. These biocides degrade over time and may leach into drainage water. In a planter over an occupied space, this is not just an abstract environmental concern — it is a problem that can appear in any building inspection water quality report.

### Complete Chemical Resistance to Fertilisers and Agrochemicals

An active planter receives, over its life, an impressive variety of chemical compounds: NPK fertilisers in granular and liquid formulations, slow-release fertilisers with polymer coatings, chelated micronutrients (iron, manganese, zinc), herbicides for invasive weed control, preventive and curative fungicides, contact and systemic insecticides. EPDM is chemically inert to all of these.

PVC membranes, by contrast, suffer plasticiser extraction from organic solvents present in some herbicide formulations. Bituminous membranes can soften on contact with certain organic compounds and may release hydrocarbons into drainage water. Cementitious coatings, once cracked, allow passage of organic acids from the substrate that progressively undermine adhesion.

Membriko specifies EPDM because, in a structural planter with a 50-year service horizon, the question is not whether the membrane will encounter fertilisers and pesticides — it certainly will. The question is whether the membrane will survive that contact without degradation.

### Flexibility for Complex Three-Dimensional Geometry

Planters are not flat surfaces. They are three-dimensional structures with interior corners, exterior corners, base-to-wall junctions, base drains and edge conditions where the membrane must terminate at a defined level above the substrate. Each of these geometric transitions is a stress point where a rigid or limited-flexibility membrane creates discontinuities that become entry points for water and roots.

EPDM at 1.5 mm has elongation at break of 300-400%. It can be folded, shaped, cut and cold-vulcanised on site without specialist equipment. Reinforcing patches for corners are applied with specific bonding adhesive and become part of the membrane through cold vulcanisation. There are no heat-welded seams as with PVC, no open-flame torching as with bitumen — only an elastic membrane that conforms to the planter geometry and that Membriko connects in a continuous system with drain collars and edge trim accessories.

## 3. Planter Types — Rooftop, Balcony, Integrated Facade, Raised Bed

### Rooftop and Terrace Planters

Built-in planters integrated into flat roofs and terraces above occupied spaces represent the highest-risk typology. A leak in a rooftop planter is a leak into the building below — often appearing in a ceiling far from its origin, difficult to trace and expensive to repair.

What makes these planters particularly complex is the requirement for absolute continuity between the planter waterproofing and the adjacent roof membrane. They are different systems in permanent contact, and the transition between them is frequently the point of failure. Membriko always treats rooftop planters as an integral part of the roof waterproofing system — not a separate element — ensuring the planter EPDM membrane and the roof EPDM membrane form a single, continuous system.

For substrate depths exceeding 400 mm (shrubs and small ornamental trees), Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM to provide additional puncture resistance from planting stakes and maintenance tools.

### Balcony Planters

Linear planters built into balconies — typically along the outer edge — have a narrow, elongated geometry with specific characteristics. The planter base is often at the same level as the balcony waterproofing, requiring both systems to form a continuous membrane, and the planter drainage must not overload the balcony drainage.

Membriko installs balcony planters in continuity with the existing or simultaneous balcony membrane, with anodised aluminium edge trim that terminates the membrane at the correct visual plane and resists mechanical impact from garden tools.

### Integrated Facade Planters

Planters incorporated into facade panels, cantilevered slabs, or deliberate projections from the facade plane represent the most geometrically demanding waterproofing challenge. They are exposed to precipitation from multiple directions including wind-driven rain, to elevated temperatures from direct solar radiation, and are frequently difficult to access after planting.

Drainage in these planters must be specifically directed to carry water away from the facade plane, preventing staining and carbonation streaking on the finishes below. Membriko always evaluates the drainage path in facade planters before specifying the system.

### Raised Bed Planters on Podium Decks

Raised planting beds on podium decks — notably over underground car parks, service basements or pedestrian walkways — combine significant substrate depth (300-800 mm for medium ornamental shrubs and trees) with proximity to pedestrian traffic loading.

Membriko specifies EPDM 1.5-2.0 mm for these applications, with a puncture-resistant protection board (heavy geotextile or rigid polyethylene sheet) between the membrane and the drainage layer when substrate depth exceeds 500 mm or when planting includes deep-rooted species.

## 4. Root Resistance — FLL Certification and EN 13948

The FLL certification is not a simple marketing label. It is the result of a rigorous scientific test that lasts a minimum of two years and involves plant species specifically selected for root aggressiveness.

The FLL test protocol, standardised as EN 13948, works as follows:
- The test membrane is placed in direct contact with Agropyron repens (common couch grass, with highly invasive horizontal rhizomes) and Quercus robur (English oak, with pivoting taproot of enormous penetrating force)
- Growing conditions are standardised — temperature, humidity, lighting — to maximise root growth
- The test is maintained for a minimum of 24 months (two full growing seasons)
- After the test, the membrane is examined for any evidence of root penetration, perforation or physical deformation

EPDM passes this test consistently. The reason is structural: the three-dimensional cross-linked network of carbon-carbon bonds created by vulcanisation is physically impenetrable to root tips. It is not a chemical barrier — it is a physical barrier that does not degrade, deplete or require renewal.

The alternatives Membriko frequently encounters in existing planters — cementitious coatings, modified bitumen, lightweight PVC — do not pass the FLL test without biocidal treatment. And biocides degrade. In a planter with 20 years of life behind it, the protective effect of biocides in an alternative membrane will have ceased long ago. FLL-certified EPDM, installed by Membriko, maintains its root resistance for the full service life of the planter.

Ornamental plant species common in Portuguese urban planters and their root characteristics are worth understanding:
- **Agapanthus africanus**: fleshy rhizomatous roots, moderate depth, very common in Lisbon and Porto planters
- **Bougainvillea spectabilis**: vigorous woody root system, requires deep planter, completely safe with FLL EPDM
- **Hedera helix (ivy)**: adventitious roots that find and exploit membrane joints if present — a reason to eliminate seams
- **Ficus benjamina**: surface roots seeking moisture, creates pressure at corners in shallow planters
- **Lavandula spp.**: woody base, fibrous roots, ideal for Mediterranean planters

All of these species are accommodated by FLL-certified EPDM from Membriko. None require any additional root barrier treatment.

## 5. Installation Process — Membriko's 7-Step Planter Waterproofing Protocol

Membriko follows a structured installation protocol for planters, developed from experience across hundreds of projects in residential, commercial and public buildings throughout Portugal.

### Step 1: Structural Inspection and Preparation

Assessment of the planter structure condition: checking for cracks in concrete or masonry, confirming the existence and position of base drains, evaluating drain condition (clearing any blockages). For renovation projects, complete removal of existing substrate and old waterproofing.

The surface must be clean, dry and free of loose particles. Point irregularities (sharp edges, formwork projections, bolt heads) are corrected with levelling mortar or removed mechanically. Surface dust is removed by brushing or vacuum.

### Step 2: Corner Rounding and Junction Filling

This is a step that less experienced installers frequently skip — and that Membriko never omits. Interior corners and base-to-wall junctions at right angles do not allow the EPDM membrane to position correctly: the membrane sits in tension at the corner, and any subsequent movement can create a stress zone that eventually fails.

Membriko fills all interior corners with triangular filler bead (using filling paste or mortar) that transforms the right angle into a 45-degree chamfered surface, allowing the membrane to sit without tension. This simple step is the foundation of a durable corner detail.

### Step 3: EPDM Membrane Installation

The EPDM membrane is cut and positioned in the planter, rising up the interior walls to a minimum of 100 mm above the intended substrate surface level. This 100 mm upstand is not an optional recommendation — it is the technical minimum required to ensure that irrigation or rainwater cannot rise above the membrane at the upper edge.

In small planters (up to 1 m²), Membriko folds the membrane at corners with pleats, bonds it to the walls with specific adhesive and installs a cold-vulcanised reinforcement patch at each corner. In larger planters, Membriko uses pre-cut corner pieces fabricated specifically for the planter geometry.

### Step 4: Corner Treatment with Vulcanised Patches

Each interior and exterior corner receives a reinforcement patch in equivalent-thickness EPDM, bonded with specific contact adhesive and cold-vulcanised. This patch is not decorative — it is structural. It is the additional layer of membrane covering the zone of highest stress concentration and that, in the event of minimal differential movement of the structure, ensures continuity of waterproofing is not compromised.

Membriko uses solvent-based contact adhesive specifically formulated for EPDM, with a defined open time. The correct application sequence — adhesive on both surfaces, waiting time, uniform pressure — is critical to bond quality.

### Step 5: Drain Collar Installation

The base drain is the most vulnerable point in any planter. It is a penetration through the membrane, and any penetration not executed correctly becomes a bypass for water.

Membriko installs EPDM drain collars manufactured for the purpose: a rubber collar that integrates with the base membrane through bonding with specific adhesive and cold vulcanisation, forming a monolithic connection between the membrane and the drain body. There is no sealant-only interface — the connection is EPDM-to-EPDM.

The drain collar is levelled so that the upper surface of the base membrane is at the same level as or slightly above the mouth of the drain, ensuring water flows naturally to the drain without accumulation.

### Step 6: Drainage Layer and Geotextile

Over the EPDM membrane, Membriko installs in sequence:
1. **Filter geotextile** (non-woven, 150-200 g/m²) — protects the membrane during drainage layer placement and prevents fine substrate particles migrating down
2. **Drainage layer** — washed gravel 8-16 mm calibre (30-50 mm depth) or plastic drainage panels for smaller planters
3. **Second filter geotextile** — over the drainage layer, to prevent substrate migrating downward and blocking drainage over time

This drainage layer serves two purposes: protecting the EPDM membrane from direct contact with substrate and maintenance tools, and ensuring excess water drains to the outlet rather than accumulating at the planter base creating hydrostatic pressure.

### Step 7: Final Inspection and Warranty Issue

Before substrate placement, Membriko conducts a complete visual inspection of the full membrane surface and all singular points (corners, drains, edge trims). For planters over critical occupied spaces, a flood test may be conducted — filling the planter with water and maintaining it for 24-48 hours before substrate placement.

Upon completion, Membriko issues a 15-year guarantee for the waterproofing.

## 6. Drainage Design Within Planters

Waterproofing and drainage are inseparable in a built-in planter. A perfect EPDM membrane does not protect a building if the drainage system is inadequate — the substrate becomes waterlogged, roots rot, plants die, and the plant replacement process damages the membrane. Membriko designs the drainage system as an integral part of every planter waterproofing project.

### The Complete Drainage Assembly

Membriko specifies the following layer sequence in all built-in planters:

| Position | Layer | Specification |
|---|---|---|
| Base | EPDM membrane | 1.5 mm, FLL certified |
| Over EPDM | Protection geotextile | Non-woven, 150-200 g/m² |
| Over geotextile | Drainage layer | 8-16 mm washed gravel, 30-50 mm depth |
| Over drainage | Filter geotextile | Non-woven, 100-150 g/m² |
| Over filter | Substrate | Mineral mix specific to plant species |
| Surface | Plants | Species appropriate to context |

### Drain Sizing

The base drain must be sized for the maximum expected irrigation flow plus a safety factor for intense precipitation. In Portugal, rainfall events of 50 mm/hour are possible across the territory — the drainage capacity of the drainage layer and drain must be calculated against this value.

Membriko calculates drainage capacity based on planter area, irrigation flow rate and the regional rainfall profile. For planters in northern Portugal, where annual rainfall exceeds 1,200 mm with intense storm events, drainage system sizing is more demanding than for equivalent planters in Lisbon or the Algarve.

### Emergency Overflow Provision

For planters without a base drain (some facade planters drain by lateral overflow), Membriko installs an emergency overflow provision — an overflow opening in the planter wall at the maximum admissible water level — that prevents hydrostatic pressure build-up on the base membrane in the event of primary drainage blockage. This is a safety-net detail that costs almost nothing to install and can prevent significant structural damage.

## 7. EPDM vs Fibreglass, Lead, Bitumen and Cementitious Coatings

Membriko frequently encounters, when renovating existing planters, a variety of waterproofing systems installed by previous contractors. The comparative analysis of the most common alternatives clarifies why EPDM is the professional reference solution.

### EPDM vs Fibreglass (GRP/Polyester)

Glass-reinforced polyester (GRP) is used in some premium projects for its aesthetic versatility (it can be pigmented) and structural rigidity. Its technical limitations in planter applications are significant:
- **Point load cracking**: GRP is rigid and brittle relative to elastomeric systems. Saturated substrate load and impact from garden tools create cracks in the gelcoat that propagate through the laminate
- **Geometric constraint**: In-situ GRP is hand-laminated — quality depends critically on applicator skill. Interior corners are stress concentration points where the laminate frequently has insufficient thickness
- **Osmotic blistering**: Water absorption through the gelcoat (osmotic blistering) is the most common maintenance problem in GRP planters after 5-10 years

### EPDM vs Lead Sheet

Lead was for centuries the waterproofing material of choice for planters and stone gutters in historic buildings. It is still specified in the rehabilitation of listed buildings. Its limitations in modern construction:
- **Weight**: Lead weighs approximately 11,340 kg/m³. A 10 m² planter lined with 2 mm lead carries 226 kg of additional structural load — not negligible
- **Availability and cost**: Quality construction-grade lead is increasingly scarce and expensive in Portugal
- **Specialist labour**: Lead installation requires craftspeople with specific training in bossing and lead burning — a skill set in decline
- **Compatibility**: Lead is incompatible with fresh concrete (alkaline attack) without adequate isolation

### EPDM vs Bituminous Membranes

Modified bituminous membranes (APP and SBS) have a long tradition in roofing and are frequently applied in planters by extension. The specific problems in this application:
- **Root resistance**: Bituminous membranes have no natural root resistance — they require a separate root barrier (copper foil or HDPE sheet) that adds cost, complexity and an additional potential failure interface
- **Sensitivity to organic fertilisers**: Certain organic compounds in fertilisers can soften bitumen, particularly under prolonged contact at elevated temperature (south-facing facade planters with direct solar exposure)
- **Seam quality in confined geometry**: Torch-applied waterproofing in confined spaces (interior of small planters) is technically difficult and creates fire risk on concrete structures with reinforcement that conducts heat

### EPDM vs Flexible Cementitious Coatings

Flexible cementitious coatings (polymer-modified cement "liquid membranes") are the most common solution in planter renovations due to their ease of application and low initial cost. Their problems are well documented:
- **Cracking from moisture cycling**: Damp substrate that dries and re-wets repeatedly creates dimensional movement in the planter. Cementitious coatings have elongation of 0-5% — any movement ≥ 1 mm creates cracks
- **Adhesion to damp substrate**: Adhesion of cementitious coatings decreases significantly when applied to damp concrete — the standard condition in renovations
- **No root resistance**: No cementitious coating passes the FLL root resistance test without additional treatment

| Property | EPDM 1.5 mm | Fibreglass GRP | Lead 2 mm | Modified bitumen | Flexible cementitious |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Root resistance | FLL certified | Limited | Moderate | None (separate barrier) | None |
| Fertiliser resistance | Excellent | Good | Good | Moderate | Poor |
| Service life | 50+ years | 15-25 years | 50+ years | 15-25 years | 5-10 years |
| Corner forming | Cold-vulcanised patch | Hand lamination | Bossing | Torch welded | Trowel applied |
| Crack risk | None (400% elongation) | Moderate | Low | Low | High |
| Additional weight (kg/m²) | 1.8 | 3-5 | 22 | 4-6 | 2-4 |

Membriko's conclusion is clear: EPDM is the only material that combines FLL-certified root resistance, complete fertiliser inertness, sufficient elongation for corner forming, and 50+ year service life in a single system.

## 8. Waterproofing-to-Structure Junction Details

The junction between the planter EPDM membrane and the adjacent structure — whether roof deck, balcony, facade or external cladding — is frequently the most technically demanding aspect of the installation, and the point most likely to fail if not properly designed. Membriko treats every transition as a singular detail warranting individual attention.

### Planter-to-Flat-Roof Junction

When a planter is integrated into an existing flat roof with EPDM, the planter membrane and the roof membrane must be joined in a continuous, seam-free connection. Membriko executes this joint with cold-vulcanised EPDM seaming tape, ensuring no interface exists between the two systems.

Where the existing roof carries a different membrane type (bituminous or PVC), Membriko installs the planter EPDM with sufficient overlap onto the existing membrane and seals the transition with compatible flashing material, creating a durable interface regardless of the substrate membrane type.

### Upper Edge Upstand Termination

The termination at the upper edge of the planter is critical. The membrane must rise:
- **Minimum 100 mm** above the intended substrate surface level
- Termination mechanically fixed with anodised aluminium or stainless steel trim bar, with a compressive sealing strip between the trim and the membrane
- Never termination by adhesive alone — mechanical fixing is the only method that resists the upward push of damp, expanding substrate over decades

For planters where the upper edge is the external face of a wall or parapet, the membrane rises up the interior to the top of the wall and is terminated beneath the coping stone or coping cap, creating a concealed waterproofing that no irrigation or rainfall event can exceed.

### Planter-to-External-Wall Junction

When a planter is adjacent to an external wall, the membrane rises up the wall and is terminated at a minimum height of 150 mm above the substrate surface level, fixed beneath an edge trim profile or integrated into an expansion joint. Membriko specifies this greater dimension (150 mm vs 100 mm) for wall-adjacent planters because wind-driven rain can create a water film higher than on protected horizontal surfaces.

### Movement Joint Treatment

Where the planter structure and the adjacent deck or roof slab have differential movement (expansion joints, construction joints), the EPDM membrane must accommodate this movement without tearing. Membriko forms a controlled fold or loop in the EPDM at movement joint positions, providing sufficient slack for the expected movement range without stress concentration in the membrane sheet.

## 10. Maintenance Guide for EPDM Planters

The greatest advantage of EPDM in a planter is that, once correctly installed by Membriko, the waterproofing requires no maintenance throughout its entire service life. There are no coatings to reapply, no joints to re-seal, no progressive cracking to monitor. Planter maintenance focuses on the drainage system and the substrate — not the membrane.

### Annual Maintenance Schedule Recommended by Membriko

**Spring (March-April)**
- Clear base drains and verify free flow
- Visual inspection of substrate level (it should not have settled below the upper geotextile — this indicates substrate compaction or loss)
- Remove any invasive weeds that may have germinated
- Check upper edge trim integrity (confirm mechanical fixing is secure)

**Summer (June-August)**
- Monitor irrigation programme — over-irrigation creates unnecessary hydrostatic pressure on the membrane base
- Check for surface waterlogging after irrigation (indicates drain blockage)
- Visual inspection of upstand areas after periods of intense heat (verify that edge trim has not expanded to the point of compromising the seal)

**Autumn (October-November)**
- Preventive drain clearance before winter rains
- Remove accumulated leaves that may block the drainage layer
- Autumn fertilisation — verify that formulations used are appropriate for container planting

**Winter (December-February)**
- Post-storm inspection (verify that any emergency overflow functioned correctly and that there is no residual water accumulation)
- Inspect any replanting carried out in autumn — confirm that new root balls have not displaced the upper protection geotextile

### What Maintenance Should NOT Include

Membriko specifically cautions against the following practices that damage EPDM planter waterproofing:
- Deep excavation with unprotected metal tools (spades or hoes in direct contact with the EPDM)
- Application of solvents, thinners or aggressive cleaning products within the planter
- Installation of irrigation systems with penetrating anchors through the planter base
- Replanting of root-balled specimens without careful removal from the upper geotextile

## 11. Portuguese Urban Greening Context

Portugal is experiencing a transformation in urban greening policy. The municipalities of Lisbon and Porto, followed progressively by other local authorities, are integrating green infrastructure requirements into their local development plans (PDM) and building regulations. The structural planter — correctly waterproofed — is one of the most practical ways to integrate permanent vegetation into the built envelope.

### Municipal Policy

Lisbon's Plano Verde de Lisboa and successive PDM revisions encourage integration of planted elements in new buildings, with increasing targets for green coverage per unit of building area. Porto follows a similar trajectory in urban regeneration zones. Membriko has been involved in projects where structural planters in terraces and facades are part of municipal green infrastructure compliance documentation.

### BREEAM and LEED Certification

The BREEAM Portugal and LEED sustainability certification systems recognise vegetation integration in buildings — including structural planters in terraces and facades — under Land Use & Ecology and Materials & Resources criteria respectively. Membriko provides developers with complete technical documentation for certification processes, including material data sheets, FLL certification evidence and installation records.

### EU Nature Restoration Law (2024)

The EU Nature Restoration Regulation (EU Regulation 2024/1991) establishes targets for ecosystem restoration and integration of natural elements in the built environment. While direct obligations fall on Member States, transposition into Portuguese building regulation will progressively strengthen incentives for vegetation integration in buildings. Membriko positions itself as a technical enabler for architects and developers seeking to align their projects with this regulatory direction.

### Portuguese Climate Considerations for Planters

Portugal's climate creates specific demands on planter waterproofing that differ markedly from Northern European conditions:

**Southern Portugal (Alentejo, Algarve)**: Planters experience substrate surface temperatures exceeding 60°C in summer. The EPDM membrane must withstand sustained contact temperatures of 40-60°C — well within its -45°C to +130°C service range. PVC alternatives approach their practical service temperature limit (approximately 60°C) in south-facing facade planters under direct solar exposure.

**Northern Portugal (Minho, Trás-os-Montes)**: Annual rainfall exceeding 1,200 mm with intense storm events creates demanding drainage requirements. A planter drainage system adequately specified for Lisbon may be wholly inadequate for Porto. Membriko sizes drainage capacity to the specific regional rainfall profile of each project.

**Coastal Portugal (Estoril, Cascais, Algarve coast)**: Salt-laden air, humidity and wind-driven rain create additional demands on edge trims and mechanical fixings. Membriko specifies marine-grade stainless steel or anodised aluminium for all metallic components in coastal planter installations.

## 12. Plant Species for EPDM Planters

Compatibility between the planting scheme and the EPDM membrane system is not just a question of root resistance — it also requires matching substrate specification, planter depth and irrigation regime to the chosen species. Membriko provides clients with basic technical guidance on appropriate species for each planter typology.

### Species for Shallow Planters (150-300 mm depth)

For shallow planters — common in balconies and terrace edges — suitable species have shallow root systems and drought tolerance:

- **Agapanthus africanus**: the emblematic plant of Portuguese gardens, fleshy rhizomatous roots that are non-penetrating, excellent performance in shallow planters in warm climates
- **Sedum spp.**: the low-maintenance standard for exposed planters; shallow roots, extreme drought tolerance, suitable for south-facing facade planters
- **Lavandula stoechas / angustifolia (lavender)**: aromatic shrub with fibrous root system, excellent for Mediterranean planters, low water demand after establishment
- **Hemerocallis (daylily)**: perennial with fibrous root system, prolific flowering, adapted to Portugal's temperate climate
- **Santolina chamaecyparissus**: drought-resistant mat-forming shrub, yellow flowering, unobtrusive root system

### Species for Medium-Depth Planters (300-500 mm)

- **Pittosporum tobira**: evergreen shrub with persistent foliage, moderate root system, widely used in Portuguese urban gardens
- **Rosmarinus officinalis / Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary)**: aromatic Mediterranean shrub, woody root of moderate growth, excellent for south-facing facade planters
- **Phormium tenax (New Zealand flax)**: ornamental with linear foliage, fibrous vertically growing roots, suited to narrow planters
- **Lavandula x intermedia 'Grosso'**: large-form lavender for premium planting, prolific summer flowering, moderate root system

### Species for Deep Raised Beds (500 mm or more)

- **Bougainvillea spectabilis**: requires minimum 500 mm planter depth and rich substrate; vigorous woody root system, completely safe with FLL-certified EPDM
- **Photinia x fraseri 'Red Robin'**: evergreen shrub of medium growth, excellent for privacy screening on balconies and terraces
- **Olea europaea (ornamental olive)**: in raised beds with minimum 600 mm substrate depth and excellent drainage; the quintessential Mediterranean symbol, increasingly popular in urban planting schemes
- **Citrus limon / aurantium (lemon/bitter orange)**: in sheltered locations, minimum 500 mm depth; appropriate to Portugal's southern and coastal climate zones

### Species to Approach with Caution in Confined Planters

- **Ficus** spp. in substrate shallower than 500 mm: surface roots seeking moisture lift geotextiles and create pressure at corners
- **Bamboo (Phyllostachys spp.)**: horizontal rhizomes of extreme expansive aggressiveness — not appropriate for any confined planter even with FLL EPDM, as rhizomes can exert sufficient force to deform shallow planter walls
- **Wisteria sinensis** in small planters: vigorous root system demands minimum 600 mm depth and strong drainage to prevent waterlogging

## 13. Design Integration: The Planter as an Architectural Element

The structural planter with EPDM waterproofing is not merely a technical element — it is a design element that architects and developers can explore with full technical confidence when waterproofing is correctly specified from the outset.

### Planters as Facade Elements

Planters integrated into the facade plane — cantilevered, recessed, or as extensions of floor slabs — allow vertical rhythms of vegetation that transform the building profile. Membriko works with architectural teams to specify facade waterproofing before the final planter design, ensuring that the technical solution is incorporated into the execution drawings and not treated as a construction afterthought.

The combination of EPDM waterproofing with architectural zinc, Corten steel or powder-coated aluminium planter casings is increasingly common in contemporary Portuguese architecture. Membriko coordinates the waterproofing-to-casing interface details with the facade specialist.

### Planters as Interior-Exterior Transition Zones

In accessible flat roofs and terraces, planters can create transition zones between sitting areas and circulation routes, define paths and create privacy without opaque built elements. The success of these solutions depends entirely on waterproofing quality — a leaking planter is a planter that will be removed, eliminating the intended spatial effect.

Membriko provides the technical confidence that allows architects to design planters as permanent, reliable elements rather than as potential problems to be managed later.

### Continuity with Green Roof Systems

Projects that combine extensive green roofs with deeper planters represent the state of the art in rooftop landscape design. Membriko specifies EPDM in a continuous system across the entire area — green roof zones and planters — ensuring no transition between systems that could become a failure point. The single-membrane approach eliminates the risk of the junction being the weakest point in the system.

When the green roof and the planters are specified simultaneously, Membriko can design the EPDM layout to cover both zones with minimal field seams, maximising the system's robustness and reducing the number of critical junction details to manage.

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions about Planter Box Waterproofing

### Does an existing concrete planter need waterproofing with EPDM?

Yes, if the planter is integrated into the building structure — particularly over terraces, balconies or occupied spaces. Concrete is not waterproof: it is a porous material that progressively absorbs water and allows infiltrations when the inevitable shrinkage cracking opens preferential paths for moisture. Original site-applied coatings (smooth screed, bituminous paint) have a service life of 5-15 years in permanent contact with damp substrate. Membriko evaluates the condition of existing waterproofing and recommends the most appropriate intervention — from localised repair to complete renovation with EPDM.

### What is the difference between waterproofing a planter and a green roof?

Technically, the requirements are very similar — both demand FLL-certified root resistance, permanent moisture tolerance and long-term durability. The practical difference is one of scale and geometry: a green roof has a much larger area and can be specified with a single EPDM sheet without field seams, while planters have complex three-dimensional geometry with many singular points (corners, drains) that each require individual treatment. Membriko applies the same technical standards to both situations.

### Does EPDM resist liquid fertilisers and pesticides?

Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to all common fertilisers (NPK, chelated micronutrients, humic acids, amino acids), ornamental-grade herbicides (glyphosate, pendimethalin), fungicides (chlorothalonil, propiconazole) and contact and systemic insecticides. EPDM's chemical inertness results from its saturated polymer chain structure — it does not depend on coatings or additives that deplete over time.

### How high should the EPDM membrane rise up planter walls?

The technical minimum specified by Membriko is 100 mm above the intended substrate surface level. For planters adjacent to external walls, the minimum upstand is 150 mm. For planters exposed to wind-driven rain or in high-rainfall regions (northern Portugal), Membriko may specify upstands of 200 mm. The membrane termination must always be mechanically fixed — never by adhesive alone — with a specific edge trim profile.

### How is EPDM installed at interior planter corners?

Interior corners are treated in two stages by Membriko: first, filling the sharp angle with a triangular filler bead that creates a 45-degree chamfered surface, eliminating the right angle where the membrane would sit in tension; second, after the continuous membrane is installed, application of a reinforcing EPDM patch over each interior corner, bonded with specific adhesive and cold-vulcanised. The result is a corner with double membrane thickness at the zone of highest stress concentration.

### How long does EPDM waterproofing last in a planter?

EPDM membrane has a documented service life of 50+ years in exterior waterproofing applications. For planters, where the membrane is protected from direct UV exposure by the substrate and drainage layer (the principal agents of exterior degradation), the expected service life is equivalent or greater. Membriko issues a 15-year guarantee, but the technical expectation for a correctly executed installation is a service life that exceeds that of the structure itself.

### Can I plant deep-rooted trees or shrubs with EPDM waterproofing?

Yes, provided the planter depth is appropriate to the species and FLL-certified EPDM is used. Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for raised beds with substrate depth exceeding 400 mm, with a puncture-resistant protection board between the membrane and the drainage layer. Species such as bougainvillea, ornamental olive, and photinia are fully compatible with FLL EPDM in planters of appropriate depth. Membriko advises on minimum depth requirements for each species category.

### What should be done if there are already infiltrations from an existing planter?

The first step is confirming that the planter is indeed the source of the infiltrations — not an adjacent structure. Membriko conducts a technical diagnosis that includes visual assessment of the planter, probing of the substrate, and where necessary, endoscopic inspection of the drains. Once the source is confirmed, the standard intervention involves complete removal of existing substrate and waterproofing, structural repair of the concrete if required, and reinstallation of EPDM with appropriate drainage. In cases where full intervention is not possible (permanently planted with established species), Membriko evaluates partial intervention alternatives — always maintaining the principle that the root cause, not just the symptom, must be resolved.
