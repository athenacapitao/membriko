# Planter Boxes (Floreiras e Canteiros) — Page Structure

## Unique Layout: 14 Sections

This page structure is designed specifically for built-in structural planters and planting boxes.
It positions EPDM as the professional solution for one of the most technically overlooked problems
in building waterproofing, emphasises FLL root resistance as the defining differentiator, and
provides detailed technical content relevant to architects, builders and building owners dealing
with planters in rooftops, terraces, balconies and facades.

### Section 1: Hero — "A Floreira que Protege o Edifício"

- **Content direction**: Reframe the structural planter not as a garden accessory but as a
  critical building waterproofing challenge. The hero should immediately elevate the perceived
  technical complexity — visitors who have had a planter leak into the space below will
  immediately connect with this framing.
- **Visual**: Cutaway diagram of a built-in planter showing the EPDM layer, drainage, substrate
  and plants — making the invisible waterproofing layer visible
- **Stats**: FLL Certificado | 50+ Anos Vida Útil | Resistente a Fertilizantes | 15 Anos Garantia

### Section 2: Introduction — Built-in Planters on Buildings

- **Content direction**: Establish the scope — this is not about garden pots but about structural
  planters integrated into terraces, rooftops, balconies and facades above occupied spaces.
  Position these planters as among the most problematic waterproofing details in building
  construction. Use the scenario of a planter leak causing damage to the space below as the
  emotional and financial hook.
- **Visual**: Photo showing a planter on a terrace with an occupied interior space below
- **Key message**: A structural planter is a waterproofing problem. Treat it as one.

### Section 3: Why EPDM Is the Right Membrane for Planters

- **Content direction**: Three-pillar argument — FLL-certified root resistance without biocides,
  complete chemical resistance to fertilisers and agrochemicals, and flexibility for complex
  three-dimensional geometry. Explain why the alternatives fail on at least one of these three
  criteria. Be technically specific — name the chemicals that degrade PVC and bituminous membranes.
- **Visual**: Diagram showing the three stress factors (roots, chemicals, geometry) acting
  simultaneously on the membrane
- **Key differentiator**: Natural root resistance + fertiliser inertness + cold-temperature
  flexibility — no other single material achieves all three

### Section 4: Planter Types — Rooftop, Balcony, Integrated Facade, Raised Bed

- **Content direction**: Four distinct planter typologies with different risk profiles and
  installation challenges. Help readers identify their own situation. For each type, identify
  the critical waterproofing detail that most commonly fails.
  1. Rooftop/terrace planters (highest risk — over occupied space)
  2. Balcony planters (linear geometry, tie-in to balcony waterproofing)
  3. Integrated facade planters (exposed, difficult access, drainage direction critical)
  4. Raised bed planters on podium decks (larger area, deeper substrate, foot traffic nearby)
- **Visual**: Isometric drawings of each planter type showing where leaks typically originate
- **Key message**: Each type has a specific failure pattern — and a specific EPDM solution

---

### Section 5: Root Resistance — FLL Certification Explained

- **Content direction**: Deep dive into the FLL root penetration test (EN 13948) and why it
  matters for planters, not just green roofs. Explain the molecular basis of EPDM's resistance.
  Contrast with biocide-dependent alternatives. Name the ornamental plant species common in
  Portuguese planters that have aggressive root systems.
- **Visual**: Microscopic-style diagram of root tip vs. EPDM molecular cross-link structure
- **Key data**: 24-month FLL test, zero penetration, no biocide additives required

### Section 6: Installation Process — Membriko's 6-Step Planter Waterproofing Protocol

- **Content direction**: Step-by-step walkthrough of the Membriko installation process for
  structural planters. Emphasise the critical steps: corner treatment (interior and exterior),
  drain collar installation, upstand height above substrate. Use the word "critical" deliberately
  at the high-stakes steps to help readers understand where professional installation matters most.
  Steps: (1) Preparation and drain check, (2) Corner rounding, (3) EPDM membrane installation,
  (4) Corner patches and vulcanised joints, (5) Drain collar fitting, (6) Drainage layer and
  geotextile, (7) Final inspection before substrate placement.
- **Visual**: Six-step numbered process with close-up images of each key detail
- **Key message**: Corners and drain collars are where 90% of planter leaks originate

---

### Section 7: Drainage Design Within Planters

- **Content direction**: Explain the drainage system as a complement to the waterproofing —
  not an alternative. An EPDM membrane without adequate drainage still fails because hydrostatic
  pressure builds up and root rot leads to dead plants and eventually replanting activity that
  damages the membrane. Specify the complete drainage assembly: filter geotextile, drainage
  layer, second filter, substrate.
- **Visual**: Cross-section diagram of complete planter assembly from EPDM to plant surface
- **Key specification**: Drainage layer 30-50 mm, filter geotextile both above and below

---

### Section 8: EPDM vs Fibreglass, Lead, Bitumen and Cementitious Coatings

- **Content direction**: Direct comparison of EPDM against the four most common alternative
  planter waterproofing approaches. Be factual and technically specific. Fibreglass cracks under
  point loading; lead is heavy and increasingly unavailable; bitumen softens at high contact
  temperatures; cementitious coatings crack under moisture cycling and provide no root resistance.
- **Visual**: Comparison table with colour-coded ratings for key properties
- **Table columns**: Root resistance | Chemical resistance | Service life | Corner forming |
  Temperature performance | Environmental profile

### Section 9: Waterproofing-to-Structure Junction Details

- **Content direction**: Address the most technically complex aspect — how the planter membrane
  ties into the adjacent roof deck, terrace membrane, or facade element. This is where continuity
  of the waterproofing system must be maintained. Include edge upstand requirements (100 mm
  minimum above substrate level), termination bar or edge trim options, and the movement joint
  approach where the planter and adjacent slab have differential movement.
- **Visual**: Detail drawings of three junction types: planter-to-roof-deck, planter wall
  upstand termination, planter-to-facade
- **Key standard**: 100 mm minimum upstand above substrate level at all edges

---

### Section 10: Technical Specifications

- **Content direction**: Full specification table with all relevant mechanical, thermal and
  chemical resistance properties. Include planter-specific parameters: fertiliser resistance
  class, FLL root resistance class, elongation (important for corner forming), minimum
  recommended thickness for different substrate depths.
- **Visual**: Clean two-column specification table
- **Standards cited**: EN 13948 (FLL), EN 13956, EN 12311-2, EN 12310-2

---

### Section 11: Maintenance Guide

- **Content direction**: Practical annual maintenance programme for built-in planters with EPDM
  waterproofing. Emphasise the importance of keeping drains clear, monitoring substrate level
  (should not rise above the EPDM upstand), and the protocol for replanting without damaging
  the membrane. The key message: EPDM reduces the maintenance burden on the waterproofing itself
  — but the drainage system around it requires periodic attention.
- **Visual**: Annual maintenance checklist
- **Key message**: Drain clearance twice a year prevents the leading cause of planter overflow

---

### Section 12: Portuguese Urban Greening Context

- **Content direction**: Frame structural planters in the broader context of Portugal's growing
  commitment to urban greening. PDM requirements in Lisbon and Porto increasingly require green
  elements in new construction. BREEAM credits for Land Use & Ecology. EU Nature Restoration
  Law and its implications for built environment. Position Membriko as an enabler of architects'
  and developers' sustainability ambitions.
- **Visual**: Map of Portugal with municipal green infrastructure programmes highlighted
- **Key regulations**: Lisbon PDM, Porto PDM, BREEAM Portugal, EU Nature Restoration Law 2024

### Section 13: Plant Species for EPDM Planters

- **Content direction**: Practical guide to plant selection for built-in structural planters
  in Portugal, with particular attention to root aggressiveness and compatibility with the
  EPDM system. Mediterranean ornamentals suitable for southern planters. More robust species
  for northern Portugal's wetter climate. Include a note on plants to avoid (vigorous climbers
  with woody root systems in shallow planters).
- **Visual**: Species photo grid with root aggressiveness rating and climate zone suitability
- **Key species**: Agapanthus, Lavandula, Rosmarinus, Pittosporum, Hedera (with caution),
  Bougainvillea (deep planter required), ornamental grasses, Sedum for low-maintenance planters
