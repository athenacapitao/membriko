# Planter Boxes (Floreiras e Canteiros) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Built-in planters and planting boxes — floreiras, canteiros, jardineiras embutidas — are among the
most technically demanding waterproofing situations in building envelope design. Unlike open-ground
planters, structural planters are permanent, load-bearing elements integrated into terraces, rooftop
slabs, balconies, facade panels, podium decks and landscaped areas directly above occupied or
structurally sensitive spaces.

The fundamental challenge is that a structural planter combines three of the most aggressive
conditions that can affect a waterproofing membrane simultaneously:

1. **Permanent biological activity**: Plant roots actively seek moisture along any imperfection in
   the waterproofing, creating directional mechanical pressure at weak points.
2. **Chemical aggression**: Fertilisers (NPK and trace element compounds), herbicides, fungicides,
   and organic acids from decomposing substrate create a chemically aggressive environment that
   degrades many membrane types.
3. **Permanent and cyclic hydraulic pressure**: Irrigation and rainfall create both sustained
   hydrostatic loading and regular wet-dry cycles in the substrate immediately in contact with the
   membrane.

Add to this the confined geometry — interior corners, exterior corners, base-to-wall junctions,
drain collars, edge trims — and it becomes clear that planter box waterproofing requires a material
with exceptional mechanical flexibility, chemical resistance and adhesion performance in complex
three-dimensional forms.

## EPDM Properties Relevant to Planter Applications

### Root Resistance: FLL Certification and EN 13948

The Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau (FLL) — Germany's landscape
research body — produces the internationally recognised guidelines for root-penetration resistance
of waterproofing membranes. The FLL test protocol, codified as EN 13948, is the standard applied
to green roof membranes and is equally applicable to planter box waterproofing where the membrane
is in direct contact with growing substrate.

Test procedure:
- Direct contact between membrane and aggressive root species (Agropyron repens and Quercus robur)
- Controlled growing conditions over a minimum of 24 months (two full growing seasons)
- Post-test examination for root penetration, perforation, or physical deformation

EPDM passes FLL/EN 13948 root resistance testing without biocidal additives. The dense, vulcanised
cross-linked polymer network is physically impenetrable to root tips. This matters particularly for
structural planters because:

- Ornamental plants commonly used in built-in planters — including many Mediterranean species,
  climbing plants and shrubs — have aggressive root systems that will exploit any membrane weakness
- Chemical root barriers (biocides in alternative membranes) degrade over time and may affect
  the quality of drainage water, creating potential compliance issues for planters over occupied
  spaces

### Chemical Resistance to Fertilisers and Agrochemicals

EPDM is chemically inert to the principal compounds found in planter environments:
- **NPK fertilisers**: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium compounds in all common formulations
  (granular, liquid, slow-release coated) — no effect on EPDM
- **Micronutrient fertilisers**: chelated iron, manganese, zinc, copper compounds — no effect
- **Herbicides**: glyphosate-based, pendimethalin, mecoprop — EPDM is inert
- **Fungicides**: chlorothalonil, propiconazole, copper oxychloride — no effect
- **Organic acids from substrate decomposition**: humic acid, fulvic acid — EPDM is inert
- **Lime and pH adjustment agents**: calcium carbonate, dolomite — no effect

By contrast:
- PVC membranes are susceptible to plasticiser extraction by organic solvents present in some
  herbicide formulations, and the plasticiser may leach into drainage water
- Bituminous membranes can soften and become tacky when in contact with certain organic compounds
  and may release hydrocarbons into drainage water, creating environmental compliance concerns
- Cementitious coatings crack under cyclic moisture loading and offer no root resistance

### Dimensional Stability and Flexibility in Complex Geometry

Structural planters are rarely simple rectangular boxes. They include:
- Interior 90-degree corners where tension stress concentrates
- Exterior corners at planter edges
- Wall-to-base junctions with fillet or radius geometry
- Drain collar penetrations at the base
- Edge conditions where the membrane must terminate at a defined level above substrate
- Possible tie-in to adjacent waterproofing on the terrace or roof deck

EPDM at 1.5 mm thickness has:
- Elongation at break: ≥ 300-400% (allows the membrane to accommodate shape changes during
  installation and subsequent substrate loading and settlement)
- Flexibility at low temperature: EPDM remains pliable at -45°C, meaning installed planters
  in northern Portugal do not experience membrane embrittlement during cold winters
- Corner forming: EPDM can be folded, vulcanised and bonded at corners without tools or heat —
  unlike PVC or TPO which require hot-air welding equipment for corner details

## Drainage System Design for Planters

Proper drainage within the planter is as important as the waterproofing membrane itself. A
common failure mode in poorly designed planters is waterlogging — the substrate remains saturated,
roots rot, plants die, and the ongoing standing water creates persistent hydrostatic pressure on
the base membrane and drain collar joint.

### Standard Drainage Assembly (Base-to-Top)

1. EPDM membrane on planter walls and base, turned up minimum 100 mm above substrate level
2. Filter geotextile (non-woven, 150-200 g/m²) laid loose over EPDM base
3. Drainage layer: 30-50 mm of washed 8-16 mm aggregate (no fines), or proprietary plastic
   drainage panels (drainage cells)
4. Second filter geotextile over drainage layer to prevent substrate contamination
5. Growing substrate: engineered mix appropriate to plant species (avoid topsoil in built-in
   planters — poor drainage and excess weight)
6. Plants

### Drain Collar Design

The junction between the EPDM membrane and the base drain is a critical detail:
- Factory-made EPDM drain collars provide a vulcanised bond between the membrane sheet and the
  drain body — mechanically superior to field-formed collars with sealant only
- The drain body should be set flush with or slightly below the upper surface of the EPDM base
  membrane to avoid creating a raised barrier that impedes drainage
- For planters without a base drain, an overflow provision at the base of the planter wall is
  essential to prevent catastrophic waterlogging

## Structural Planter Types and Waterproofing Approach

### Rooftop and Terrace Planters

Planters integrated into roof terraces or podium decks above occupied spaces are the highest-risk
category. A leak in this planter is a leak into the building below. Characteristics:
- EPDM in the planter must connect to the roof deck EPDM without a gap or transition — one
  continuous watertight system
- Structural movement between the planter box and the adjacent slab must be accommodated
- Access for inspection is typically limited to the planter surface

### Balcony Planters

Planters integral to balcony structures, typically concrete-formed with the slab:
- Usually smaller geometry (0.3-1.0 m width) with long linear runs along the balcony edge
- Critical detail: the base of the planter is often at the same level as the balcony waterproofing
  — the planter membrane and the balcony membrane must form a single continuous system
- High risk of facade infiltration if planter edge drainage is insufficient

### Integrated Facade Planters

Planters formed as part of the building facade — on corbelled slabs, in spandrel panels, or as
deliberate projections from the facade plane:
- Exposed to wind and driving rain from multiple directions
- Often more difficult to access for inspection after planting
- Drainage must be directed away from the facade plane to avoid staining and water tracking

### Raised Bed Planters

Free-standing or semi-structural raised planting beds, including those on waterproofed podium
decks or over underground car parks:
- Larger footprint than balcony or terrace planters
- Greater substrate depth (300-600 mm typical for shrubs and small trees)
- The EPDM base membrane must accommodate the weight distribution of saturated substrate plus
  foot traffic if the adjacent deck is accessible
- For substrate depths exceeding 400 mm, the EPDM should be specified at 2.0 mm to provide
  additional puncture resistance from plant stakes and maintenance tools

## Portuguese Context

### Urban Greening Policy

Portugal's major municipalities increasingly mandate or incentivise integration of planting in
building design:
- Lisbon's Plano Verde de Lisboa and successive PDM revisions encourage planting integration
  in new residential and commercial development
- Porto's PDM includes provisions for green infrastructure in urban regeneration zones
- BREEAM Portugal credits for Land Use & Ecology are achievable through well-designed integrated
  planting schemes
- EU Building Directive revisions are moving toward requiring green elements in new construction

### Climate Considerations

Portugal's climate creates specific demands on planter waterproofing:
- **Summer heat and drought**: planters in southern Portugal experience substrate surface
  temperatures exceeding 60°C. The EPDM membrane must withstand sustained contact temperatures
  of 40-60°C — well within its -45°C to +130°C service range. PVC alternatives soften and
  deform at temperatures approaching 60°C in direct contact with heated substrate.
- **Irrigation intensity**: planters in the Algarve and Alentejo require frequent irrigation
  during the dry season (June-September), creating permanent moisture cycling that accelerates
  degradation in PVC and cementitious systems. EPDM is chemically unaffected by continuous wet
  conditions.
- **Winter storm events**: intense rainfall (>50 mm/day in northern Portugal, >100 mm/day in
  extreme events) can exceed drainage capacity in improperly designed planters, creating
  temporary hydrostatic head that an inadequate membrane base cannot resist.

### Plant Species and Root Aggressiveness

Common ornamental species used in Portuguese urban planters and their root characteristics:
- **Agapanthus africanus**: fibrous roots, moderate depth, very common in Lisbon planters
- **Pittosporum tobira**: moderate root system, common coastal and urban plant
- **Hedera helix (ivy)**: adventitious roots capable of finding and exploiting membrane joints
- **Bougainvillea spectabilis**: woody root system, particularly aggressive in warm climates
- **Ficus benjamina / F. elastica**: tropical plants often used indoors/sheltered planters;
  surface roots can exert significant pressure
- **Lavandula spp.**: woody base, fibrous roots, excellent for Mediterranean planters
- **Rosmarinus officinalis / Salvia rosmarinus**: moderate fibrous root system

All of these species are accommodated by FLL-certified EPDM. None require any root barrier
treatment in addition to the membrane.

## Research Summary

The principal technical references for planter box waterproofing with EPDM are:
- FLL Guidelines for the Planning, Construction and Maintenance of Green Roofing (current edition)
- EN 13948 root penetration resistance test results for EPDM membranes from major manufacturers
- ASTM D471 immersion testing data confirming EPDM inertness to NPK fertiliser solutions

- Municipal guidance documents from Lisbon (Plano Verde) and Porto on green infrastructure
  integration in building design

No specific Portuguese standard exists for structural planter waterproofing. Practitioners apply
the FLL green roof guidelines, EN 13956, and manufacturer installation specifications. This
represents both a market opportunity (education) and a responsibility for installers like Membriko
to specify and execute to international best-practice standards.
