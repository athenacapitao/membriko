# Window Detailing — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Window detailing occupies a unique position in the Membriko content architecture: it addresses the #1 building defect complaint in Portugal (window water ingress) and speaks simultaneously to three distinct audiences — building owners who have already experienced the problem, architects and specifiers who design the solution, and renovation contractors who install it. The page must establish EPDM flashing as a superior alternative to the sealant-only approach that dominates Portuguese practice, while demonstrating that Membriko has the technical depth to execute window details correctly in complex situations (ETICS facades, heritage renovation, Passivhaus airtightness requirements).

The tone is diagnostic and authoritative. The opening section must create immediate recognition in any reader who has experienced a leaking window junction — "yes, that is exactly what happened" — before explaining why it happened and how the correct solution prevents recurrence. Unlike the flat roofs page, which is defending EPDM against bituminous alternatives, the window detailing page is primarily defending a system approach (flashing + membrane) against the inadequate industry standard (sealant only). This is a more nuanced competitive positioning and requires a slightly more educational, patient tone.

The section order follows the same diagnostic persuasion arc as other Membriko application pages, adapted for the window context:
1. Problem recognition — window leaks as the #1 defect (emotional hook for any building owner)
2. Why EPDM — the material case specific to dynamic window junctions
3. Window type guide — demonstrate breadth of expertise across all frame types
4. Products — the specific EPDM tapes and membranes used
5. Installation process — the full technical sequence step by step
6. ETICS integration — the complexity only a specialist handles correctly
7. System comparison — EPDM vs sealant-only vs butyl tape
8. Condensation management — the hidden failure mode that only Membriko addresses
9. Technical specifications — for specifiers and engineers
10. Maintenance — manage expectations and extend value
11. Portuguese standards — regulatory confidence for architects
12. Common mistakes — pre-emptive credibility through honesty
13. Renovation and retrofit — the largest market segment
14. FAQ — eight questions, long-tail search capture

## Section 1: Hero — Window Leaks Are Portugal's Most Common Building Defect

**Purpose:** Immediate problem recognition and emotional connection before any product mention.

**Content:**
- Headline: "Detalhes de Janelas: a Causa n.º 1 de Infiltrações em Edifícios Portugueses" (Window junctions are responsible for 30–40% of all water ingress complaints in Portuguese construction)
- Sub-headline: One sentence positioning EPDM flashing membranes as the engineering alternative to sealant-only approaches that fail within 5–10 years
- Three stat blocks: 30-40% of infiltrations caused by window junctions / 5–10 year sealant lifespan vs. 50+ year EPDM / 20-year Membriko installation warranty
- Primary CTA: "Diagnóstico Gratuito de Caixilharia" / Secondary CTA: "Ver Processo de Instalação" (anchor link)
- Background: Close-up of correctly installed EPDM flashing at a window jamb, or photo of window with visible water damage staining on adjacent wall

**Design note:** The hero headline should name the problem before naming the solution — this is the highest-intent search entry point on the page.

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Window Detailing

**Purpose:** Establish the material case specific to dynamic window junctions; differentiate from sealant-only approach.

**Content:**
Four property pillars presented as icon + heading + two-sentence explanation:

1. **Elasticidade Permanente (Permanent Elasticity)**
   - 300–450% elongation at break; maintains full flexibility from -45°C to +150°C
   - Tracks frame movement through thousands of thermal cycles without fatigue or cracking

2. **Sem Plastificantes (No Plasticisers)**
   - Unlike PVC tapes, EPDM contains no plasticisers to migrate and embrittle over time
   - The flexibility that EPDM has on day one is the flexibility it retains after 50 years

3. **Resistência UV Intrínseca (Intrinsic UV Resistance)**
   - Saturated molecular backbone does not participate in photooxidation reactions
   - No sacrificial UV coating that depletes — the material itself is UV-stable

4. **Adesivo de Butilo (Butyl Adhesive Backing)**
   - The factory-applied butyl layer is itself a permanently flexible sealant
   - Maintains compression seal against the substrate independent of surface adhesion

**Visual:** Four-column icon grid. Optional: cross-section diagram comparing EPDM flashing tape (flexible, continuous) with sealant joint (rigid, single point of failure).

## Section 3: Window Types — One System for All Frames

**Purpose:** Demonstrate breadth of expertise; help readers identify their specific situation.

**Content:** Three expandable cards or tabbed panels:

1. **Alumínio (Aluminium)**
   - Coefficient of thermal expansion: 23 µm/m·°C (twice that of concrete)
   - Differential movement per 2 m frame width over 60°C seasonal range: ±1.2 mm per jamb
   - Thermal break profiles: standard in Portuguese new construction per REH
   - Membriko approach: 1.5 mm EPDM flashing tape with 75 mm overlap each side; corner pre-forms at every 90° junction; sill pan with minimum 5% slope and weep apertures

2. **PVC**
   - Coefficient of thermal expansion: 50–80 µm/m·°C (3–5× concrete)
   - Largest differential movement of any common frame type — sealant systems fail fastest here
   - Plasticiser migration risk from PVC frame to oil-based sealants
   - Membriko approach: EPDM/butyl tapes are chemically compatible with PVC; no plasticiser interaction; wider overlap (100 mm each side) specified to accommodate larger movement range

3. **Madeira (Timber)**
   - Moisture-driven dimensional change: 1–3% perpendicular to grain
   - Seasonal swelling and shrinking changes joint width — sealant cracks in tension, compresses and detaches in compression
   - Decay risk if water is retained at junction — the sill pan must drain, not just seal
   - Membriko approach: EPDM sill pan with positive drainage priority; jamb tapes bonded to treated timber with primer; head flashing designed to project 40 mm clear of frame to prevent water tracking back

**Visual:** Three side-by-side frame cross-section schematic diagrams showing the flashing tape in position relative to each frame type and wall/ETICS system.

## Section 4: EPDM Flashing Products Used by Membriko

**Purpose:** Transparency and credibility — show exactly what is used and why.

**Content:** Three product categories as cards:

1. **Fita EPDM Auto-Adesiva (Self-Adhesive EPDM Tape)**
   - EPDM layer: 1.0–1.5 mm; Butyl layer: 0.5–1.0 mm; Total: 1.5–2.5 mm
   - Widths: 50 mm / 100 mm / 150 mm / 200 mm / 300 mm
   - Temperature service range: -40°C to +120°C
   - Used for: jamb flashing, head flashing, transition details

2. **Membrana EPDM em Folha (EPDM Sheet Membrane)**
   - Thickness: 1.2 mm or 1.5 mm
   - Elongation: ≥ 300% (EN 12311-2)
   - Used for: sill pan fabrication, large-area window reveals
   - Same membrane as Membriko roofing systems — no proprietary special-purpose product

3. **Peças Pré-Formadas de Canto (Pre-Formed Corner Pieces)**
   - 150 mm × 150 mm EPDM corners — internal and external 90° angles
   - Factory-formed — no site fabrication of corners required
   - Eliminates the most common failure point in window flashing systems

**Visual:** Product photography or technical illustrations of each component. Note that actual brands used may vary by project; the specifications above are minimum requirements.

## Section 5: Installation Process — Step by Step

**Purpose:** Demonstrate technical depth and process discipline; give architects and contractors confidence in the Membriko method.

**Content:** Numbered vertical timeline with icon per step and 3–4 sentences per step.

1. **Inspecção do Vão de Obra** — Inspect rough opening geometry, surface condition, existing sealants; verify sill slope (minimum 5% to exterior); repair all voids and cracks
2. **Preparação da Superfície** — Remove old sealants; clean and dry all bonding surfaces; apply primer where required (aerated concrete, treated timber)
3. **Instalação da Calha de Peitoril** — Fabricate sill pan from EPDM sheet with corner pre-forms at both ends; install with positive slope; confirm weep drainage path to exterior
4. **Flashing dos Contrafortes** — Apply self-adhesive EPDM tape to both jambs; overlap sill pan upstand by minimum 75 mm; carry tape up to head level in single uncut piece
5. **Flashing do Lintel** — Install head flashing last; overlap jamb tapes; carry minimum 150 mm up wall; integrate with facade system or ETICS carrier
6. **Assentamento do Caixilho** — Set frame on setting blocks; fix perimeter at specified intervals; fill perimeter gap with compatible sealant or compressible tape
7. **Vedação Interior** — Apply airtightness tape on interior perimeter; continuous, lapped at corners; critical for both water management and air infiltration control
8. **Inspecção e Registo** — Photograph all flashing laps and critical junctions; retain photographic record before covering with render, ETICS or internal finishes

**Visual:** Vertical step timeline with icons. Optional: sequential photographs or illustration of each installation stage.

## Section 6: Integration with ETICS Facade Systems

**Purpose:** Address the most technically complex common scenario — ETICS-clad buildings, which represent a growing proportion of Portuguese renovation work.

**Content:**
- Brief explanation of why ETICS creates additional window detailing complexity (frame position in wall cross-section, integration of flashing with insulation layer and render, drainage path through insulation thickness)
- Four ETICS-specific Membriko protocols:
  1. Frame position verification before flashing — frame must be at the insulation plane, not the masonry plane, to avoid thermal bridges
  2. ETICS window rebate profile coordination — aluminium carrier profile must be fixed to the wall before EPDM flashing so the flashing lap is protected by the profile rather than exposed to the insulation layer
  3. EPDM flashing tape extended across the insulation-to-frame gap and up behind the ETICS base coat
  4. Drip profile at head: aluminium profile projecting minimum 30 mm beyond ETICS surface, bonded to the head flashing, to direct water away from the ETICS face

**Visual:** Cross-section detail drawing showing ETICS system, window frame, EPDM sill pan, jamb flashing, and head drip profile in correct relative positions. This is the most technical illustration on the page.

## Section 7: EPDM vs Sealant-Only vs Butyl Tape

**Purpose:** Handle the most common objections: "why not just re-silicone it?" and "we used butyl tape and it failed."

**Content:** Comparison table with 5 rows and 4 columns.

| Feature | EPDM Flashing System | Silicone Sealant Only | Standard Butyl Tape |
|---|---|---|---|
| Expected service life | 50+ years | 5–10 years | 10–20 years |
| Response to frame movement | Full elastic recovery | Cohesive fatigue failure | Creep failure over time |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic — permanent | UV stabilisers deplete (5–10 yr) | Poor — surface degrades |
| Water management | Sill pan actively drains | Barrier only — no drainage backup | Barrier only — no drainage backup |
| Failure mode | No predictable failure mode in design life | Crack, detach at joint edges | Harden, crack at movement zones |

Short paragraph below the table acknowledging that for small, sheltered window junctions on renovation projects where sill pan installation is impractical, a high-performance hybrid approach — EPDM tape at jambs and head with a quality neutral-cure silicone at the frame-to-tape interface — can be a Membriko-endorsed intermediate solution. Honesty increases trust.

**Visual:** Colour-coded comparison table. Optional life-cycle diagram showing the sealant replacement cycle vs. one-time EPDM installation.

## Section 8: Condensation Management at Window Perimeters

**Purpose:** Address the hidden failure mode that building owners rarely understand but that architects and specifiers care about deeply.

**Content:**
- Explain that condensation at window jambs is not a frame defect — it is a detailing defect: cold surfaces at the frame-to-wall junction create localised cold spots below the dewpoint of interior air
- Three elements Membriko's window detailing controls that directly reduce condensation risk:
  1. Correct frame position in wall cross-section (near insulation plane) reduces the linear thermal transmittance (Ψ value) at the junction
  2. Continuous interior airtightness tape prevents warm humid air reaching the cold junction surface
  3. Correct EPDM flashing geometry eliminates the cold bridge created by a gap or uninsulated zone between the frame and the wall insulation
- Note: Membriko provides Ψ-value calculation for window perimeter junctions on request for Passivhaus and near-Passivhaus projects

**Visual:** Thermal image (or illustration of isotherms) showing a correctly detailed window junction vs. a poorly detailed junction. The visual impact of cold bridge elimination is immediately legible in a thermal image.

## Section 10: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Manage expectations, demonstrate long-term commitment, and reduce anxiety about future obligation.

**Content:**
- Key message: correctly installed EPDM window flashing requires minimal maintenance, but a 5-year inspection cycle is good practice
- Annual owner inspection checklist (5 points): check for debris accumulation at sill pan weep holes; check for mechanical damage to flashing tape at corner zones; check that no new construction activity has disturbed the flashing at the perimeter; check interior airtightness tape for detachment; check that the frame-to-flashing interface silicone has not cracked
- Membriko 5-year inspection service: photographic condition assessment, minor repairs under warranty, written condition report
- Estimated annual maintenance cost vs. cost of water ingress remediation: orders of magnitude difference

---

## Section 11: Portuguese Standards and Regulatory Context

**Purpose:** Confirm compliance and eliminate doubt for specifiers, architects, and public-sector clients.

**Content:**
- REH (Decreto-Lei n.º 118/2013) — energy performance requirements for windows, including thermal bridging at perimeter; correct detailing is required to achieve REH compliance in practice
- NP EN ISO 6946 — thermal transmittance calculations; linear thermal bridge (Ψ) at window perimeter
- LNEC ITE 50 (2006) — national guide to waterproofing; references window junction detailing
- EN 13956 — the product standard under which the sheet membrane component of Membriko's window systems is CE-marked
- NP EN ISO 9972 / EN 13829 — airtightness testing; window perimeter detailing directly affects n50 results
- Brief note on absence of a Portuguese equivalent to German RAL window installation guidelines and British Standard BS 8213; Membriko's protocol is developed from these international references adapted for Portuguese construction practice

## Section 12: Common Mistakes Membriko Prevents

**Purpose:** Build trust through diagnostic honesty; pre-empt "what could go wrong."

**Content:** Six failure points as expandable accordion:

1. **Sealant-Only Without Sill Pan** — No backup drainage; one crack = water ingress; prevention: sill pan installed before any sealant
2. **Flashing Applied to Wet or Dusty Substrate** — Adhesion fails at first thermal cycle; prevention: substrate moisture and cleanliness check before every tape application
3. **Wrong Flashing Overlap Sequence** — Head tape installed before jambs traps water behind the system; prevention: strict sequence (sill → jambs → head) enforced on every installation
4. **Sill Pan Dams Below 50 mm** — Overflow in driving rain; prevention: minimum 50 mm dam height standard on all Membriko installations
5. **No Weep Drainage in Sill Pan** — Water accumulates in pan and finds alternative routes through frame or wall; prevention: weep hole or slot confirmed clear at installation and inspection
6. **ETICS Integration Not Coordinated** — Flashing buried under insulation without drainage path or mechanical protection; prevention: ETICS subcontractor coordination meeting before installation begins on every ETICS project

---

## Section 13: Renovation and Retrofit

**Purpose:** Address the largest actual market — existing buildings with failing window seals — with specific information for this context.

**Content:**
- Key message: EPDM window flashing retrofit is possible on virtually all window types without frame removal
- Three retrofit scenarios with Membriko approach for each:
  1. **Frame in place, sealant failed** — Remove old sealant; clean substrate; apply EPDM tape system without disturbing frame; if sill pan cannot be retro-fitted (frame cannot be lifted), install a surface-mounted EPDM sill flashing over the existing sill; life expectancy 40+ years
  2. **Frame replacement planned** — Full Membriko system installed in the rough opening before new frame; optimal scenario for maximum performance; sill pan, jamb and head tapes all installed to specification
  3. **ETICS retrofit (ITE — Intervenção de Reabilitação Térmica de Edifícios)** — Existing window in place, ETICS being added to exterior; flashing must be carefully integrated with the new insulation layer and carrier profiles without removing the window; Membriko has a specific protocol for this scenario involving progressive flashing installation coordinated with the ETICS installer
- Brief note on grants: Portugal's PRR (Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência) and Casa Eficiente 2050 programme fund window replacement and associated detailing work; Membriko can provide documentation to support grant applications
