# Window Detailing and Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Window Leaks: Portugal's Most Common Building Defect

There is a building defect that affects more Portuguese properties than flat roof failures, bathroom waterproofing breakdowns, and terrace drainage failures combined. That defect is water ingress at the window-to-wall junction. European building defect databases consistently place window interface failures as responsible for 30 to 40 per cent of all water ingress complaints in residential construction. The Portuguese national engineering laboratory, LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil), has documented window junction failures as the leading cause of interior dampness in Portuguese buildings constructed after the year 2000 — a sobering finding about the most universally undertaken element of modern construction.

Membriko, Portugal's EPDM membrane specialist, based in Pombal, addresses this problem at its source. Not with a higher-grade silicone sealant — a solution that typically lasts five to ten years before the underlying movement problem reasserts itself, requiring the same repair to be performed indefinitely at five-year intervals. Not with standard butyl tape, which hardens over one to two decades as it loses its capacity to track relative movement between frame and wall. But with a complete EPDM membrane flashing system: the same vulcanised rubber chemistry that has been protecting flat roofs for more than fifty years, applied to the most critical and most frequently inadequately detailed element of the building envelope.

When Membriko installs an EPDM window flashing detail, the result is not simply "more durable sealant". It is a waterproofing architecture that actively manages water entering the frame-to-wall interface — routing it harmlessly to the exterior — while tolerating the dimensional movement of any frame type without fatigue accumulation across decades of thermal cycling. This distinction between a barrier that will eventually fail and a system that actively manages water is the difference between repeating the same repair every five years and not thinking about the matter again for the lifetime of the building.

## Why EPDM is the Correct Material for Window Detailing

The selection of EPDM for window junction waterproofing is not a commercial preference. It is a direct consequence of the physical and chemical properties that EPDM possesses and that all conventional alternatives do not.

### Permanent Elasticity Without Plasticisers

The most important property of any material applied to a window junction is the ability to deform and recover repeatedly, across decades, without fatigue accumulation or progressive stiffening. The junction between an aluminium window frame and the surrounding concrete or masonry wall is subject to estimated relative movement of ±1 to 2 mm per 60°C surface temperature variation — and this cycle repeats thousands of times across the building's service life.

Vulcanised EPDM has an elongation at break between 300 and 450 per cent. This is not a property that the material possesses in its early years and gradually loses, as occurs with silicone (whose curing additives are photodegraded by UV exposure over time) or with PVC tapes (whose plasticisers migrate, leaving the material progressively rigid and brittle). EPDM's elasticity is an intrinsic property of the vulcanised molecular network — the three-dimensional structure of polymer chains cross-linked by sulphur bridges, formed during manufacture and stable indefinitely. Membriko installs EPDM window flashings with confidence that the material placed today will retain the same mechanical properties thirty years from now.

### Intrinsic UV Stability in the Molecular Structure

Silicone sealants degrade superficially under UV exposure, losing methyl groups from the surface and forming a progressively brittle silicon dioxide layer. Polysulphide and polyurethane sealants undergo photooxidation in their molecular chains. EPDM shares none of these degradation mechanisms. The primary molecular chain of EPDM — composed of saturated ethylene and propylene repeat units — contains no unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds on the main chain, which are the primary targets of UV photons and atmospheric ozone. EPDM's resistance to UV radiation is not achieved through UV stabiliser additives that deplete over time: it is intrinsic to the polymer chemistry. Membriko does not specify a protective overcoat or a secondary UV-barrier coating for EPDM window flashing details. The membrane is itself the finished product.

### Butyl Adhesive: A Permanently Flexible Sealant

The self-adhesive EPDM flashing tapes used by Membriko carry a factory-applied butyl adhesive layer. Butyl (polyisobutylene) is a permanently flexible elastomeric sealant — it does not cure to a rigid state, it does not change properties with age, and it maintains its compression and sealing capacity indefinitely. In practical terms, the interface between the EPDM tape and the concrete substrate or aluminium frame has two independent sealing mechanisms: the adhesive bond between the butyl and the surface, and the mechanical compression of the butyl against the surface (which acts as a compression seal even if the adhesive bond ages). This is why EPDM/butyl systems have a performance history significantly superior to plain butyl tapes or silicone-only solutions.

### Universal Chemical Compatibility

EPDM is chemically inert to alkaline lime and cement in masonry, to humic acids present in organic deposits on facades, to the cleaning solutions used in building maintenance, and to acidic condensate water. There is no galvanic interaction between EPDM and the aluminium or stainless-steel profiles of modern window frames. There is no plasticiser migration between EPDM and PVC window profiles. Membriko does not need to verify chemical compatibility between its EPDM membrane and the concrete substrate, the render mortar, or the aluminium window frame — compatibility is guaranteed by the material's chemistry.

---

## Window Types: One System for Every Frame Material

Membriko installs EPDM window flashing details across all window frame types used in Portugal. Each frame type presents specific movement characteristics and interface geometry that the waterproofing detail must accommodate. Understanding these differences is what distinguishes a specialist from a generalist installer.

### Aluminium Windows

Aluminium has a coefficient of thermal expansion of approximately 23 µm/m·°C — roughly twice that of reinforced concrete at 11 to 13 µm/m·°C. For a window 2 metres wide, the 60°C seasonal temperature range typical of Portuguese inland regions produces differential thermal movement of approximately 1.2 mm at each jamb. This movement is cyclical, predictable, and quantifiable — and it is precisely what the EPDM flashing system is dimensioned to accommodate.

Modern aluminium window profiles for Portugal incorporate thermal breaks — sections of low-conductivity material that interrupt the all-metal cross-section — to comply with the REH (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios) energy performance requirements. Thermal-break profiles alter the surface temperature distribution across the frame cross-section: the interior face of a thermal-break frame is significantly warmer than that of a monolithic aluminium profile, reducing condensation risk on the glazing surface. However, the window-to-wall junction remains a linear thermal bridge — a localised cold zone where interior warm humid air can condense if the junction is not correctly detailed. Membriko includes linear thermal transmittance (Ψ value) assessment for the window-to-wall junction in the technical diagnosis of all REH-relevant projects.

The Membriko protocol for aluminium windows: 1.5 mm self-adhesive EPDM flashing tape with minimum 75 mm lap on each side of the interface; pre-formed EPDM corner pieces at every 90° junction; sill pan fabricated from 1.2 mm EPDM sheet membrane with minimum 5% slope to the exterior and confirmed drainage aperture before frame installation.

### PVC Windows

PVC window profiles have a coefficient of thermal expansion between 50 and 80 µm/m·°C — three to five times that of reinforced concrete. For the same 2-metre-wide window exposed to a 60°C temperature range, differential movement at a PVC window jamb can reach 3 to 4 mm. This is why silicone sealants fail faster at PVC windows than at any other frame type — silicone cannot track this movement range without cohesive or adhesive failure within a few years.

There is also a specific chemical compatibility risk at PVC windows: plasticisers present in PVC profiles can migrate into oil-based or solvent-based sealants and alter their curing characteristics, reducing adhesion and accelerating degradation at the interface. The EPDM/butyl tapes used by Membriko are chemically compatible with PVC and do not depend on chemical bonding to the profile — the butyl compression seal functions independently of the adhesive interface quality.

The Membriko protocol for PVC windows specifies a minimum tape overlap of 100 mm on each side of the interface (rather than the 75 mm standard for aluminium) to accommodate the larger movement range; surface primer on the PVC profile to maximise butyl adhesion; and an annual owner inspection recommended for the first five years after installation to confirm that the greater PVC movement is not generating stress concentration at tape terminations.

### Timber Windows

Timber window frames have a modest coefficient of thermal expansion — lower than aluminium — but a significant moisture-driven dimensional change. Untreated or lightly treated timber can change dimension by 1 to 3 per cent perpendicular to the grain in response to seasonal humidity variation. On a 100 mm frame section width, this represents 1 to 3 mm of seasonal movement perpendicular to the grain — which is also perpendicular to the window-to-wall interface. This movement is expansive in the wet winter (timber absorbs moisture and swells) and contractive in the dry summer. A rigid sealant fractures in tension during summer contraction and is compressed and detached during winter expansion.

The specific risk at timber windows that Membriko addresses as a priority is water retention at the junction. Water held against timber — particularly when a sealant has failed and created a crevice where moisture accumulates — accelerates timber decay, corrodes metallic fixings, and creates the ideal environment for mould growth. The EPDM sill pan flashing, which actively drains water entering the frame-to-wall interface to the exterior, is the only solution that eliminates this risk rather than simply attempting to exclude water at a single barrier line.

The Membriko protocol for timber windows: primer applied to treated timber before EPDM/butyl tape application; sill pan with minimum 8% slope to the exterior (greater than the 5% standard for aluminium and PVC, reflecting the elevated water retention risk); head flashing projecting 40 mm beyond the outer face of the window frame to prevent water tracking back underneath the head flashing by capillary action.

## EPDM Flashing Products Used by Membriko

Membriko does not prescribe a single proprietary product brand. Flashing systems are selected on the basis of minimum technical specifications and compatibility with the specific substrate and frame type. Products used on site consistently meet the specifications below.

### Self-Adhesive EPDM Flashing Tape

Self-adhesive EPDM flashing tape is the primary component of the jamb and head flashing system. The EPDM layer is 1.0 to 1.5 mm thick; the butyl adhesive layer is 0.5 to 1.0 mm thick; total system thickness is 1.5 to 2.5 mm. Tapes are available in widths of 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 mm — Membriko selects the appropriate width for each interface based on the rough opening geometry and the level of wind-driven rain exposure. Elongation of the EPDM layer exceeds 300%, measured to EN 12311-2. Service temperature range is -40°C to +120°C. UV resistance is intrinsic — no additional protective coating is required.

### EPDM Sheet Membrane for Sill Pan Construction

The sill pan — the horizontal flashing element at the base of the rough opening that captures water bypassing the frame perimeter seal and drains it to the exterior — is fabricated by Membriko from 1.2 mm or 1.5 mm EPDM sheet membrane. This is the same membrane material used in flat roof and gutter lining applications — not a special-purpose limited-application product. The sheet is cut and folded to form a base with two upstand dams and a front drip edge, and is installed with positive slope to the exterior. Corners receive pre-formed EPDM corner pieces.

### Pre-Formed EPDM Corner Pieces

Pre-formed corner pieces are factory-moulded EPDM sections shaped to 90° internal and external corner configurations — typically 150 mm × 150 mm on each face. Their use is non-negotiable in the Membriko approach. Attempting to fabricate a watertight corner in flat EPDM tape on site — through cutting, folding, and on-site sealing — is the single most common failure point in window flashing systems. Pre-formed corners eliminate this failure point entirely. Membriko installs pre-formed corner pieces at every 90° junction in every window flashing detail, without exception.

---

## The Membriko Installation Process — Step by Step

The quality of a window flashing system depends as much on the installation sequence as on the materials used. Membriko follows a rigorous, documented installation sequence on every project. Any deviation from this sequence — any skipped step or shortcut — compromises the integrity of the system in ways that may not become apparent until months or years later.

### Step 1 — Rough Opening Inspection

Before any material is opened, the Membriko technician inspects the rough opening. This inspection verifies: sill slope (minimum 5% towards the exterior — if the slope is inadequate or inversed, a sloping mortar screed is applied and allowed to cure fully before proceeding); concrete or masonry condition on all four faces of the opening (all voids, honeycombing, cracks, and delaminated zones are repaired with compatible repair mortar); any existing sealant, tape remnants, or incompatible primers are removed entirely; and the rough opening geometry relative to the window frame being installed, to confirm that the perimeter clearance gap is within the frame manufacturer's recommended range.

### Step 2 — Surface Preparation

Surface preparation is the least visible and most critical step. All bonding surfaces are cleaned of dust, oil, cement laitance, and any other contamination. Surface moisture is measured with a calibrated moisture meter — for concrete and masonry, surface moisture must not exceed 4% by weight for butyl adhesive bonding. Where the substrate is autoclaved aerated concrete block or treated timber, a primer compatible with the butyl adhesive is applied and allowed to cure for the duration specified by the manufacturer before the tape is applied.

### Step 3 — Sill Pan Installation

The sill pan is installed first, before any other component of the flashing system. Membriko fabricates the sill pan from EPDM sheet cut to the width of the rough opening plus two upstand dams of minimum 50 mm height at each end and a front drip projection of minimum 25 mm beyond the outer face of the wall. Pre-formed EPDM corner pieces are installed at each sill-to-jamb junction using lap sealant and seam tape; the manufacturer's cure time is observed before proceeding.

The sill pan is bonded to the sill substrate using EPDM contact adhesive or, for self-adhesive systems, by removing the release film and applying firm uniform pressure. The minimum 5% slope to the exterior is verified with a level after bonding. The drainage aperture at the outer face — the exit point for water collected in the pan — is confirmed to be unobstructed before the window frame is installed. This aperture cannot be cleaned once the frame is in place.

### Step 4 — Jamb Flashing

Jamb flashing is the second component installed, always after the sill pan is fully installed and any adhesive or sealant has cured. Self-adhesive EPDM tape is applied to each jamb in a single uncut piece, from the top of the sill pan upstand dam (with minimum 75 mm overlap onto the dam) to the head level. The tape covers the inner face of the rough opening and extends onto the outer face of the wall or ETICS — the overlap width on each side corresponding to the specification for the frame type (75 mm for aluminium, 100 mm for PVC).

Application requires the release film to be removed progressively as the tape is pressed against the surface — not removed entirely before application — to prevent the tape from adhering prematurely to itself or to the wrong surface. A silicone roller is used to apply firm uniform pressure across the full bonded area. No air bubbles are acceptable within the overlap zone between the jamb tape and the sill pan upstand.

### Step 5 — Head Flashing

Head flashing is the last flashing component to be installed, always overlapping the top of both jamb tapes (never tucked underneath). The head tape overlaps the jamb tapes by minimum 75 mm at each end. The projection onto the outer face of the wall above the window is minimum 150 mm, to ensure that water running down the face of the wall above the window is directed clearly to the exterior and does not re-enter the system by capillary action at the head tape edge.

On buildings with ETICS cladding, an aluminium drip profile is bonded to the outer edge of the EPDM head flashing and projects minimum 30 mm beyond the face of the ETICS, with a drip nosing at the lower edge. Without this drip profile, water runs down the ETICS surface, enters the ETICS system by capillarity at the head rebate edge, or accumulates at the frame-to-head-flashing interface.

### Step 6 — Frame Setting and Perimeter Sealing

The window frame is set on levelling packers after all flashing installation is complete and inspected. Perimeter fixing is made at the points specified by the frame manufacturer. The perimeter clearance gap between the frame and the EPDM flashing — typically 10 to 20 mm — is filled with closed-cell polyurethane foam (in the inner zone of the gap, for thermal and acoustic performance) and with a compatible neutral-cure silicone sealant at the visible outer face.

### Step 7 — Interior Airtightness Sealing

The interior perimeter of the window-to-wall junction is sealed with an airtightness tape — typically a pre-compressed polyurethane tape or a vapour-control tape product, lapped at corners. This interior seal is as important to the building's energy performance as the exterior flashing is to its weathertightness. Without it, warm interior air migrates through the junction, reaches the cold surface of the frame or wall, condenses, and produces interstitial moisture that degrades the surrounding materials progressively without being visible until significant damage has occurred.

### Step 8 — Inspection and Photographic Record

Membriko photographs all flashing overlaps, all corner pieces, and all critical interfaces before these are covered by render, ETICS finish coats, or internal finishes. This photographic record is archived in the project technical file and provided to the client. No Membriko project is considered complete without this documentary evidence. In the event of a future warranty investigation, the photographic record is the primary evidence of installation quality.

## Integration with ETICS Facade Systems

Portugal has experienced a significant increase in the application of ETICS (Sistemas Compostos de Isolamento Térmico pelo Exterior — External Thermal Insulation Composite Systems) to both new buildings and existing building renovation, driven by REH energy performance requirements and by the PRR and Casa Eficiente 2050 funding programmes. The presence of an ETICS cladding system creates additional technical demands for window detailing that most ETICS installers are not equipped to resolve — and that Membriko treats as an integral part of the waterproofing process.

### Frame Position in the Wall Cross-Section

In walls with ETICS, the window frame must be positioned at the outer face of the base wall — ideally at or near the insulation layer plane — to minimise the linear thermal bridge at the window-to-wall junction and to allow the EPDM flashing to be integrated with the ETICS system without compromising the continuity of the insulation layer. If the frame is placed at the inner face of the wall (as was traditional Portuguese practice before ETICS), the thermal bridge at the junction is substantially more significant — the linear thermal transmittance (Ψ value) can reach 0.10 to 0.20 W/m·K, contributing materially to heat loss and condensation risk. Membriko verifies frame positioning before any flashing is installed and advises the client when the proposed positioning would result in a thermal bridge that exceeds REH compliance limits.

### Integration of Flashing with the ETICS Render Profile

The EPDM jamb flashing tape is extended beyond the outer face of the base wall and integrated with the ETICS window reveal profile — typically an aluminium profile with embedded fibreglass mesh that defines the ETICS edge around the window opening. Membriko installs the flashing before the ETICS reveal profile is fixed, so that the flashing is protected by the profile rather than exposed to the exterior or buried without a drainage path beneath the insulation layer.

### Aluminium Drip Profile at the Head

The interface between the ETICS head reveal and the window frame is one of the most critical points on the entire facade in terms of water ingress risk. Water running down the ETICS surface above the window must be directed clear of the ETICS face without contact with the window frame or with the frame-to-ETICS interface. Membriko installs an aluminium drip profile bonded to the EPDM head flashing, projecting minimum 30 mm beyond the outer face of the ETICS, with a drip nosing at the lower edge. This detail is mandatory on all ETICS projects and is specified at the coordination stage with the ETICS installer before work begins.

## EPDM vs Silicone Sealant vs Standard Butyl Tape — An Objective Comparison

Membriko regularly receives the question: "Why not simply re-apply silicone, this time with a better-quality product?" An honest answer requires an objective comparison of the three systems most commonly used in Portugal.

High-quality silicone sealant — specifically, low-modulus neutral-cure silicone — is a competent product for joints with limited movement range and correctly dimensioned joint geometry. Its realistic service life at window-to-wall junctions exposed to UV and significant differential movement in Portugal is five to ten years. This is not a product quality defect — it is an intrinsic limitation of any elastomer that cures to a semi-rigid state. Once cured, silicone has a substantially higher elastic modulus than uncured EPDM; it cannot track frame movement as freely and accumulates stress at the joint edges that eventually produces cohesive or adhesive failure. The solution of simply re-applying silicone every five to ten years is a perpetual maintenance commitment, not a resolution of the underlying problem.

Standard butyl tape — typically aluminium-foil-faced tape with a butyl adhesive layer — has an intermediate service life of ten to twenty years depending on UV exposure. The aluminium foil carrier layer can fatigue under thermal cycling and develop transverse cracking. The butyl layer may flow at elevated temperatures — the service temperature ceiling of standard butyl tapes is typically around 70°C, which is insufficient for south-facing facade surfaces in Portugal during summer, which can reach 60 to 70°C at peak solar irradiance.

Membriko's EPDM/butyl system combines the intrinsic UV stability of the EPDM layer with the permanently flexible compression seal of the butyl layer. It has no metallic carrier layer susceptible to thermal fatigue. The EPDM membrane service temperature range of -45°C to +150°C is far beyond any real facade surface temperature in Portugal. Its predictable service life exceeds fifty years, based on the same field-validated data that documents EPDM performance in flat roofing applications across Europe and North America.

| Feature | Membriko EPDM System | Quality Silicone Sealant | Standard Butyl Tape |
|---|---|---|---|
| Expected service life | > 50 years | 5–10 years | 10–20 years |
| Response to frame movement | Full elastic recovery — no fatigue | Progressive cohesive fatigue | Creep; cracking at movement zones |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic — permanent | UV stabilisers deplete in 5–10 years | Poor — surface degradation |
| Active water management | Sill pan drains to exterior | Barrier only — no backup drainage | Barrier only — no backup drainage |
| ETICS integration | Integrated within ETICS system | Not integrated | Not integrated |

Membriko acknowledges that in retrofit situations where sill pan installation is not practical without frame removal, a hybrid approach — EPDM tape at jambs and head with compatible neutral-cure silicone at the frame-to-tape interface — can be an appropriate intermediate solution. This honest position is preferable to claiming that any single system resolves every configuration without qualification.

## Condensation Management at Window Perimeters

Condensation at window jambs is one of the most frequent complaints from Portuguese building owners — and one of the most widely misunderstood. Most owners attribute condensation at the frame to a glazing defect or a frame quality issue. In many cases, condensation at the window-to-wall junction is a detailing defect: discontinuities in the insulation layer and uninsulated zones at the junction create localised cold surfaces below the dewpoint of the interior air, causing condensation to form on the wall surface adjacent to the frame rather than on the glass.

Membriko addresses condensation risk at window perimeters through three direct interventions that are part of the standard installation process.

The first is verification and correction of the frame position in the wall cross-section. A frame placed at the inner face of the wall — far from the exterior insulation layer — creates a cold-bridge extension that projects into the building interior where warm humid air is present. Repositioning the frame to the insulation plane (always recommended in renovation where structurally feasible, and mandatory in new construction to REH compliance) substantially reduces the linear thermal transmittance at the junction. Where frame repositioning is not possible, Membriko specifies insulating jamb lining boards between the frame and the existing reveal to reduce the cold bridge.

The second intervention is continuous airtightness tape on the interior perimeter of the junction. This tape prevents warm interior air from reaching the cold junction surface and condensing. It is not a substitute for the exterior flashing — the two elements are complementary and serve different functions. Membriko installs both on every project.

The third intervention is the correct EPDM flashing geometry. A correctly dimensioned flashing eliminates the uninsulated void zone that commonly exists between the outer face of the frame and the wall insulation — which, when present, acts as a localised cold collector. The EPDM membrane, in continuous contact with both the window frame profile and the wall surface, eliminates this void.

For Passivhaus and near-Passivhaus projects, Membriko provides the calculated Ψ value for the window-to-wall junction and confirms that the installed detail meets the minimum interior surface temperature factor requirement (fRsi ≥ 0.75) at the relevant design conditions.

## Maintenance of EPDM Window Flashing Details

One of the most practical advantages of the Membriko EPDM flashing system is its minimal maintenance requirement across its service life. Unlike silicone, which must be inspected and periodically replaced at five-to-ten-year intervals, a correctly installed EPDM flashing detail requires no scheduled preventive maintenance for decades.

Membriko recommends a five-year inspection cycle as sound building management practice — not as an urgent necessity, but as early detection for any anomaly produced by external causes such as physical damage during maintenance operations, facade modification works, or nearby construction activity. The five-point owner inspection checklist requires no specialist knowledge and no scaffolding access: confirm that the sill pan drainage aperture is unobstructed; verify that the jamb tape terminations show no lifting or detachment at the edges; confirm that no subsequent works have covered or compressed the flashing; verify that the interior airtightness tape is fully bonded; and check that the silicone sealant at the frame-to-tape interface has not cracked.

Membriko offers a five-year inspection service that includes a photographic condition assessment of all flashing components, minor repairs covered under the installation warranty, and a written condition report provided to the client. The cost of this preventive inspection is a fraction of the cost of active water ingress remediation — and in the vast majority of cases it avoids that cost entirely.

## Portuguese Standards and Regulatory Context

### REH — Energy Performance Regulations for Buildings

Decreto-Lei n.º 118/2013 and its updating legislation define mandatory minimum performance requirements for windows in new Portuguese construction and major renovation, including maximum thermal transmittance values for frames (Uf), glazing (Ug), and the combined window U-value (Uw). The window waterproofing and airtightness detail directly affects whether the in-situ performance of the installed window meets the design specification. A thermally optimised window installed without adequate perimeter flashing will have its energy performance negated by air infiltration and condensation at the perimeter.

### NP EN ISO 6946 — Thermal Transmittance Calculations

This standard defines the calculation method for thermal transmittance of walls and roofs, including the treatment of linear thermal bridges (Ψ values) at window-to-wall junctions. Membriko provides the calculated Ψ value for the window junction detail it installs, on request, for projects where REH compliance documentation is required.

### LNEC ITE 50 — National Guide to Waterproofing in Construction

The LNEC ITE 50 (2006) is Portugal's primary national technical document on waterproofing in building construction and includes guidance on window junction detailing in masonry construction. Membriko's installation protocol is consistent with ITE 50 guidance and extends beyond it in several respects, including the sill pan system, pre-formed corner pieces, and ETICS integration.

### EN 13956 — Flexible Sheets for Waterproofing

The European harmonised product standard that defines performance requirements for flexible waterproofing sheets. The EPDM sheet membrane used by Membriko to fabricate sill pans is CE-marked under this standard as a Type 3 sheet (vulcanised synthetic polymer sheet).

### NP EN ISO 9972 / EN 13829 — Building Airtightness Testing

The building envelope airtightness test (the blower door test, quantified by the n50 value in air changes per hour) is increasingly required in Portugal for building licensing and for high-performance energy certification. Window perimeter airtightness contributes directly to the measured n50 value. The airtightness tape that Membriko installs on the interior perimeter of all window details as part of its standard process is one of the elements that enables buildings to achieve n50 values compatible with Passivhaus certification (≤ 0.6 h⁻¹) and with high-performance construction (n50 ≤ 1.5 h⁻¹).

### Note on the Absence of a Portuguese Window Installation Standard

No dedicated Portuguese standard exists for window installation detailing equivalent to the German RAL Gütegemeinschaft window installation guidelines or the British Standard BS 8213-4. Portuguese practice references European standards and manufacturer guidelines. Membriko's installation protocol is developed from these international references — in particular the German RAL guidance, which is the most technically comprehensive and most widely adopted in Europe — adapted for Portuguese construction practice, frame types, and climatic conditions.

## Common Mistakes That Membriko Prevents

Across hundreds of water ingress investigations in Portuguese buildings, Membriko has identified the most frequent installation errors that produce window leaks. We share this information openly because transparency builds trust — and because these errors are precisely what the Membriko process is designed to prevent.

### No Sill Pan — The Most Prevalent Error

The absence of a sill pan is the most common and most consequential installation error. Without a sill pan, the waterproofing system has only one line of defence — the perimeter frame seal — and when this fails, water enters directly into the wall structure without any capture and drainage system. The sill pan is the second line of defence that transforms a single-barrier system into a managed drainage system. Membriko installs a sill pan on every window, even when the client considers that the frame "does not need one".

### Flashing Applied to Wet or Dusty Substrate

Butyl adhesive bonding depends on a clean, dry, laitance-free surface. Fresh concrete still curing, masonry with salt efflorescence deposits, and unpainted render with surface dust all produce inadequate adhesive bonds that fail at the first thermal movement cycle. Membriko systematically verifies surface moisture and cleanliness using a calibrated moisture meter before every tape application — not by visual inspection alone.

### Incorrect Flashing Overlap Sequence

Installing the head flashing before the jamb tapes, or the jamb tapes before the sill pan, creates overlaps in the wrong direction — directing water into the system rather than out of it. The sequence is invariable: sill pan first, jamb tapes second, head flashing last. Each component overlaps the component below it, from bottom to top. This sequence is enforced on every Membriko installation, regardless of site logistics or access sequence.

### Sill Pan Dams Below 50 mm Height

A sill pan with upstand dams below 40 mm height will overflow in heavy wind-driven rain — precisely the conditions under which the waterproofing system is most critically loaded. Membriko specifies minimum 50 mm upstand dam height on all installations, and 75 mm on facades with high wind-driven rain exposure or on windows with tilt-and-turn opening configurations where water can accumulate on the interior sill.

### Sill Pan Drainage Aperture Blocked or Absent

A sill pan without a confirmed, unobstructed drainage aperture is not a sill pan — it is a collection basin. When the water level in the pan rises sufficiently, it enters through the base of the window frame, through the glazing-to-frame interface, or through the frame-to-reveal junction. Membriko confirms the drainage aperture before frame installation and documents it in the photographic record. This is the one element that cannot be rectified after the frame is in place without frame removal.

### Insufficient Coordination with the ETICS Installer

EPDM flashing buried under an ETICS layer without a drainage path is functionally useless — the water captured by the sill pan has nowhere to go. On every ETICS project, Membriko holds a coordination meeting with the ETICS installer before window flashing work begins, to confirm the works sequence, the integration detail at each window reveal, and the drainage path from the flashing through the ETICS thickness to the exterior.

---

## Renovation and Retrofit — The Largest Market Segment

The majority of the window detailing market in Portugal consists of existing buildings with installed windows and active or recent water ingress problems. Membriko has direct experience with every retrofit scenario, and a specific technical protocol for each.

### Existing Frame in Place, Sealant Failed

The most common scenario: an aluminium or PVC window in sound structural condition, but with cracked or detached perimeter silicone and a history of water ingress episodes. The Membriko process in this scenario removes all existing sealant completely, prepares the substrate, installs EPDM flashing tape at the jambs and head, and installs a surface-mounted EPDM sill flashing over the face of the existing sill. This surface sill flashing — bonded to the sill face and to the base of the jamb tapes — reproduces the function of the built-in sill pan in a situation where the frame cannot be lifted. Expected service life of this retrofit solution is thirty to forty years.

### Window Replacement Planned

The optimal scenario for Membriko: the existing frame is removed and the complete flashing system is installed in the rough opening before the new frame is placed. Built-in sill pan with correct slope, jamb flashing, and head flashing installed to the full protocol. The new window frame is then set on the installed flashing system. This sequence produces the best achievable result and is what Membriko recommends whenever window replacement is the client's chosen course of action.

### ETICS Retrofit to Existing Building

The addition of ETICS to a building with existing windows installed without flashing is technically the most complex retrofit scenario. The existing frame, installed flush with the outer face of the base wall, is now recessed behind the ETICS thickness — typically 60 to 120 mm — creating an integration challenge: water running down the ETICS surface above the window must be directed to the exterior without entering the existing frame-to-wall interface, which may already be defective. Membriko has a specific protocol for this scenario, developed from direct project experience, involving progressive installation of EPDM extension head tapes integrated with the ETICS system's window reveal profile and an aluminium drip profile projecting beyond the ETICS face. This protocol has been applied successfully on numerous ITE (Intervenção de Reabilitação Térmica de Edifícios) projects across central Portugal.

The Portuguese PRR (Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência) and Casa Eficiente 2050 programmes fund window replacement and thermal renovation works that include window interface waterproofing. Membriko can provide the technical documentation required to support grant applications under these programmes, including specification of works, material declarations, and photographic installation records.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What causes leaks in new windows installed less than five years ago?

The most frequent cause of leaks in recently installed windows is the absence of a sill pan in the rough opening. Window installation in Portugal is commonly performed with perimeter sealant as the only waterproofing measure — no sill pan, no jamb flashing, no head flashing. The silicone performs adequately for the first two to five years, but differential thermal movement between the frame and the wall progressively develops micro-cracks in the sealant bead that grow with each thermal cycle. Membriko diagnoses this pattern in virtually every new building where it is asked to investigate water ingress. The resolution is a retroactive installation of the complete EPDM flashing system — ideally with temporary frame removal to permit a built-in sill pan — and does not require the window to be replaced if the frame is in sound condition.

### What is the difference between EPDM and silicone for window sealing?

Silicone is a joint sealant — a material that cures to a semi-rigid elastomeric state and seals the interface between the frame and the wall. Its function is to exclude water at a single line. The Membriko EPDM flashing system is a complete waterproofing architecture: it includes a primary barrier (the EPDM tapes at the jambs and head), a secondary capture system (the sill pan), and a controlled drainage path to the exterior. While silicone assumes that the primary barrier never fails — an assumption that cannot be sustained across decades — the Membriko EPDM system functions correctly even when the frame perimeter seal is imperfect. This is the fundamental distinction: a system that actively manages water versus a barrier that will eventually fail.

### Is EPDM compatible with aluminium, PVC, and timber window frames?

Yes. EPDM membrane and butyl adhesive are chemically compatible with aluminium, PVC, and treated timber. For PVC, Membriko specifies wider tape overlaps (100 mm rather than 75 mm) to accommodate the larger differential movement range. For timber, surface primer is applied before the butyl tape and more frequent condition checks are recommended during the first five years to monitor the hygroscopic dimensional change. There is no documented chemical incompatibility between EPDM/butyl and any of these common frame materials.

### How does the EPDM sill pan work and why is it necessary?

The sill pan is a tray-shaped piece of EPDM sheet membrane installed at the base of the rough opening before the window frame is set. Its function is to capture any water that bypasses the perimeter frame seal — through sealant micro-cracks, capillary action, or wind pressure — and drain it to the exterior through an aperture in the front face of the pan. It is necessary because no primary sealing system is perfect across decades of movement, and because water that enters a rough opening without a sill pan flows directly into the wall structure or into the building interior. The sill pan is the difference between "the sealant can develop a minor imperfection and water drains harmlessly to the exterior" and "the sealant has a minor imperfection and water enters the wall".

### How long does EPDM window flashing installation take?

A single window in a residential building, with an existing frame and normal site access conditions, typically requires half a day to one full working day for complete retrofit flashing installation. Where the frame is being replaced and the full sill pan system is installed in the rough opening, the flashing installation takes one to two working days (including primer and adhesive cure times) before the new frame is installed. On buildings with multiple windows or ETICS facades, Membriko provides a detailed works programme based on the pre-installation inspection of each specific project.

### Is it possible to install EPDM flashing without removing the existing window?

Yes, in the majority of cases. EPDM jamb and head flashing tapes are installed on the exterior face of the rough opening, on the outer wall or ETICS surface, without requiring access to the rough opening interior. The built-in sill pan — which does require access to the rough opening — can be replaced with a surface-mounted sill flashing bonded to the face of the existing sill and integrated with the jamb tapes. This retrofit solution has a service life of thirty to forty years and eliminates the need for frame removal in most circumstances. Membriko assesses the feasibility of this approach at the initial diagnostic visit.

### Does EPDM flashing improve energy performance and acoustic insulation?

Directly, EPDM flashing contributes to building envelope airtightness. The interior airtightness tape that Membriko installs as a standard part of the process reduces cold air infiltration and warm air exfiltration through the window perimeter — contributing to reduced energy demand and improved interior comfort, particularly in winter. Indirectly, a correctly installed EPDM detail eliminates the interstitial moisture in the surrounding wall that progressively degrades installed thermal insulation performance. On the acoustic side, the complete perimeter gap filling with closed-cell foam and sealant — part of the Membriko process — contributes to reduced sound transmission through the window perimeter, which is frequently greater than transmission through the glazing itself in poorly sealed windows.

### What warranty does Membriko provide for window flashing details?

Membriko issues a twenty-year installation warranty for all window flashing details executed to the complete Membriko protocol — sill pan, jamb flashing, head flashing, and interior airtightness tape. This warranty is complementary to, and does not replace, the five-year statutory defects liability under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Artigo 1225.º). Each client receives a warranty certificate describing the installed system and the photographic record of all critical interfaces. In cases where a built-in sill pan is not practicable without frame removal and a surface-mounted retrofit sill flashing is installed instead, the warranty applies to the retrofit system installed and has a duration of fifteen years.
