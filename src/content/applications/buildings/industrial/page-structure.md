# Industrial Buildings — Page Structure

## Unique Layout: 14 Sections

This page structure targets building owners, procurement managers, facility engineers and
architects specifying waterproofing for Portuguese industrial buildings. The emphasis is on
total cost of ownership, chemical resistance, large-area installation efficiency and minimal
operational disruption. The Portuguese industrial zones angle creates local SEO relevance
while establishing Membriko as the specialist for the Centro de Portugal industrial market.

### Section 1: Hero — "A Cobertura Industrial Que Não Falha"
- **Visual**: Aerial or wide-angle photograph of a large industrial warehouse with a clean EPDM
  membrane roof, possibly showing solar panels integrated
- **Stats**: Até 15,25 m de Largura | 50+ Anos de Vida Útil | Instalação a Frio | Resistência Química

### Section 2: Introduction — Portugal's Industrial Sector and the Roofing Challenge
- Scale of Portuguese industrial building stock
- The three problems: large area to waterproof, demanding environment, operational continuity
- Why the right membrane system matters over 50 years of building life
- Membriko's position serving industrial clients from Pombal across Centro and nationwide

### Section 3: Why EPDM for Industrial Roofing
- Structural case: large single sheets reducing seam count dramatically
- Chemical resistance in industrial environments
- Temperature performance from cold storage to high-bay heat
- Fire safety and cold installation in operational facilities
- Lightweight advantage for steel-deck structures

### Section 4: Types of Industrial Buildings and EPDM Solutions
- Warehouses and logistics hubs (flat deck, large area, minimal penetrations)
- Manufacturing and assembly facilities (penetrations, equipment, ventilation)
- Food processing plants (hygiene, chemical resistance, HACCP considerations)
- Cold storage and refrigeration facilities (thermal gradient management)
- Mixed-use industrial parks (phased installation, tenant continuity)

### Section 5: The Large-Area Single-Sheet Advantage
- EPDM sheet dimensions: up to 15.25 m × 61 m
- Seam count comparison: EPDM vs TPO vs bituminous on a 5,000 m² roof
- Probability of failure as a function of seam count over time
- Factory-fabricated custom sheets: planning and logistics

### Section 6: Installation on Metal Deck and Concrete Substrates
- Trapezoidal steel decking: mechanical fastening patterns, thermal movement accommodation
- Precast concrete planks: substrate preparation, adhesive compatibility
- In-situ concrete slabs: vapour control layer requirements
- Composite decks: mixed-substrate detailing
- Membriko's 7-step industrial installation process

### Section 7: Chemical and Oil Resistance
- EPDM's non-polar polymer structure and chemical resistance mechanism
- Resistant substances: dilute acids, alkalis, animal fats, vegetable oils, water
- Limitation acknowledgement: aromatic hydrocarbons (honest technical guidance)
- Comparison with bituminous and PVC resistance profiles
- Industrial sectors where EPDM chemical resistance is decisive

### Section 8: EPDM vs TPO vs PVC vs Bituminous for Industrial
- Full comparison table: conformability, seam count, chemical resistance, fire class,
  service life, cool-roof performance, total cost of ownership
- Why cool-roof TPO is not always the right answer for Portuguese industrial buildings
- The 50-year cost model: replacement cycles and maintenance costs

### Section 9: Energy Efficiency — Cool Roof Options for Industrial Buildings
- Heat gain through industrial roofs: impact on interior comfort and HVAC loads
- Light-coloured EPDM and white-coated EPDM: SRI values and solar reflectance
- RECS energy regulation context for conditioned industrial spaces
- ROI calculation framework for cool-roof industrial specification
- Combination with photovoltaic systems: EPDM as the ideal PV-compatible substrate

### Section 10: Fire Safety Compliance for Industrial Buildings
- EN 13501-1 and BROOF(t3) classification
- SCIE Portuguese fire safety regulation for industrial occupancies
- Cold installation as a fire risk reduction during works on operational sites
- EPDM fire classification documentation for building permits

### Section 11: Technical Specifications
- Full properties table: thickness, elongation, tensile strength, puncture resistance,
  vapour resistance, temperature range, fire class
- Available thicknesses: 1.2 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.8 mm, 2.0 mm
- Mechanical fastening vs fully adhered vs ballasted systems for industrial applications
- Insulation compatibility: PIR, mineral wool, EPS under EPDM

### Section 12: Maintenance with Minimal Operational Disruption
- Why EPDM requires minimal routine maintenance
- Inspection protocol: annual visual check, 5-yearly detailed inspection
- Common EPDM defects in industrial settings and repair methods
- Maintenance contracts: what Membriko offers industrial clients
- Working in occupied industrial facilities: safety protocols, material handling, noise

### Section 13: Portuguese Industrial Zones — Local Relevance
- Centro de Portugal: Pombal, Leiria, Coimbra industrial corridor (Membriko's home market)
- Greater Lisbon: Setúbal Peninsula, Loures, Sintra industrial estates
- Greater Porto: Maia, Matosinhos, Aveiro industrial parks
- Alentejo and Algarve agro-industrial facilities
- Response times and project logistics for nationwide coverage

### Section 14: Cost-Benefit for Large Industrial Areas
- Cost per m² comparison across membrane systems for a 10,000 m² roof
- Total cost of ownership at 10, 20, 30 and 50 years
- The replacement cost factor: removing a failed bituminous system vs. maintaining EPDM
- Financing and phased investment approaches for large industrial portfolios
- How to request a Membriko survey and budget quotation
