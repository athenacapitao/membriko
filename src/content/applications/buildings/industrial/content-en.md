# Industrial Building Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Portugal's Industrial Sector and the Challenge of Large-Area Roofing

Portugal's industrial property sector spans a remarkable range of building types, ages and operational contexts. From the vast logistics warehouses that line the A1 motorway corridor between Lisbon and Porto, to the food-processing facilities of the Alentejo, the automotive plants of the Setúbal Peninsula, the industrial parks of Aveiro and Braga, and the agro-industrial installations of the Centre and North — the Portuguese industrial building stock represents hundreds of millions of square metres of roof surface requiring continuous, durable waterproof protection.

Membriko, based in Pombal and operating across Portugal, has built its industrial roofing practice around a single technical conviction: that EPDM rubber membrane is the correct answer for industrial roof waterproofing, and that the evidence for this conviction becomes more compelling as the scale of the project increases. At 1,000 m², EPDM is a good solution. At 10,000 m², it is the clearly superior solution. At 50,000 m², it is the only rational specification.

The Portuguese market has been slower than its Northern European counterparts to adopt EPDM as the dominant system for industrial roofing. In the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom, EPDM has held the majority share of the large-area flat roof market for decades. In Portugal, modified bitumen retained its dominant position through the 1990s and 2000s, largely by inertia — it was familiar, available and widely installed. The economic logic of EPDM for large industrial areas is, however, irresistible: a single correctly installed EPDM system on a 15,000 m² warehouse will cost substantially less over 50 years than any bituminous or thermoplastic alternative, even before accounting for the operational disruption costs of replacing a failed membrane system on an operational industrial facility.

This content covers the full territory of industrial waterproofing with EPDM: the technical case for EPDM on large-area roofs, the different building types and their specific requirements, the decisive large-sheet advantage, installation on steel deck and concrete substrates, chemical resistance in demanding industrial environments, honest comparison with TPO, PVC and bitumen, energy efficiency considerations, fire safety compliance, detailed technical specifications, and the cost-benefit model that underpins Membriko's recommendation for every industrial project. The aim is that any facilities manager, operations director, project engineer or industrial property owner who reads this page will understand, with full technical grounding, why Membriko and EPDM are the correct choice for their building's roof.

## The Technical Case for EPDM on Industrial Roofs

### Molecular Architecture: Why EPDM Outperforms

EPDM — Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer — is a vulcanised synthetic rubber whose molecular structure is fundamentally different from the bituminous or thermoplastic materials it competes with. The saturated polymer backbone, cross-linked during vulcanisation, delivers a combination of properties that no other membrane system provides in a single product: elongation at break exceeding 300%, thermal service range from -45°C to +130°C, chemical resistance to dilute acids and alkalis, animal and vegetable fats, and a wide range of industrial process fluids, plus resistance to ozone and ultraviolet radiation that ensures the membrane does not degrade with decades of Portuguese sun exposure.

Membriko selects and specifies EPDM membranes according to the specific requirements of each industrial installation. There is no single product for all situations — there is a technical selection process that Membriko conducts for every project, determining the appropriate membrane thickness, the correct fixing system for the deck type and local wind conditions, and the accessories and construction details that ensure the system performs as a coherent whole across decades of service life.

### Sheet Size: The Argument That Changes Everything

The most powerful case for EPDM on industrial roofs is not elongation or chemical resistance — it is sheet size. EPDM is manufactured in sheets of exceptionally large width: up to 15.25 metres wide and 61 metres long. In a single piece of EPDM, Membriko can cover more than 930 square metres without a single field seam.

For a 5,000 m² industrial warehouse, this means the complete installation can be executed with fewer than six longitudinal joints running the length of the building. Compare this to alternatives: a modified bitumen SBS roll at 1.0 metre effective width requires more than 50 joints over the same area; a TPO roll at 1.5 metres effective width requires more than 33 joints. Every joint is a potential failure point. Eliminating joints eliminates risk — and EPDM eliminates joints in a way no alternative can match.

Membriko plans every industrial project to minimise joint count. Before ordering materials, the project is drawn sheet by sheet, maximising use of available formats and positioning unavoidable joints in zones of lower risk and easier inspection. This planning work, which bituminous installers rarely undertake, is an integral part of Membriko's service for every industrial client.

### Chemical Resistance in Industrial Environments

Industrial facilities generate and process substances that attack conventional waterproofing membranes. Modified bitumen — SBS or APP — is vulnerable to aromatic hydrocarbons, organic solvents, animal fats and mineral oils: substances common in factories, workshops, food-processing plants and agricultural storage facilities. The degradation is insidious: the bitumen absorbs organic compounds, the binder softens, the membrane loses cohesion and begins to crack or separate at joints — often without visible evidence until the first heavy rainfall produces infiltration.

EPDM's non-polar polymer structure makes it resistant to dilute acids, dilute alkalis, water, animal fats, vegetable oils, salt solutions, alkaline cleaning detergents and a wide range of common industrial process fluids. Membriko is transparent about limitations: EPDM should not be exposed to concentrated aromatic hydrocarbons (petrol, toluene, xylene) or chlorinated solvents in direct, prolonged contact. For refinery or fuel-storage installations where the membrane would be in regular contact with these substances, Membriko recommends specialist geomembranes. For the great majority of Portuguese industrial buildings — from logistics warehouses to food factories, cork-processing facilities to automotive assembly — EPDM's chemical resistance is superior to any comparably priced alternative.

### Thermal Performance Under Industrial Extremes

Industrial buildings impose unusual thermal demands on their roof membranes. Cold-storage and refrigerated logistics facilities operate at interior temperatures of -25°C to +4°C, creating large thermal gradients between the conditioned interior and a roof membrane that may reach 70-80°C under Portuguese summer sun. High-bay manufacturing and logistics buildings — often 12 to 18 metres in internal height — stratify heat in summer, producing elevated temperatures at roof level. Cold-processing facilities generate intense interior humidity that condenses against the underside of the roof system.

EPDM's service range of -45°C to +130°C provides ample margin for every Portuguese industrial condition. Bituminous membranes, by contrast, soften at surface temperatures above 60-70°C — temperatures routinely exceeded on exposed dark-surfaced roofs in the Alentejo and Algarve in August — progressively losing cohesion and becoming susceptible to flow and deformation on roofs with minimal falls. EPDM's thermal cycling fatigue resistance — the ability to endure thousands of heat/cool cycles without microcracking or delamination — is well-documented in laboratory studies and confirmed by field performance data from Northern European industrial buildings where EPDM membranes installed in the 1980s are still in service.

### Lightweight: A Structural Advantage for Steel-Deck Buildings

Most industrial buildings constructed in Portugal since the 1990s have a steel-frame structure with trapezoidal steel decking as the roof substrate. These structures are engineered with specific dead-load limits for the roofing system — and the additional weight of a heavy waterproofing system can be a genuine engineering constraint when retrofitting an existing structure.

An EPDM membrane of 1.5 mm thickness weighs approximately 1.5 to 2.0 kg/m², inclusive of adhesive or fasteners. A two-layer SBS bituminous system weighs typically 5 to 8 kg/m². A single-layer TPO system with mechanically fastened insulation boards weighs approximately 2.5 to 4.0 kg/m². For a 10,000 m² warehouse, the weight difference between EPDM and a two-layer bituminous system represents between 35,000 and 60,000 kilograms of additional dead load — a figure that may require structural verification and potentially structural strengthening when a bituminous system is specified on an existing steel-frame building. EPDM's low weight frequently eliminates this requirement, saving both time and engineering cost.

## Types of Industrial Buildings and EPDM Solutions

### Warehouses and Logistics Hubs

The large-area warehouse is the most common industrial building type in Portugal and the most favourable case for EPDM installation. Flat or near-flat roofs, long spans with minimal penetrations, trapezoidal steel decking — these characteristics maximise the efficiency of large-format EPDM sheet installation. Membriko approaches every warehouse project with a sheet-by-sheet installation plan that minimises joint count, positions inevitable joints in lower-risk zones away from drainage collection points, and designs perimeter and penetration details with system-compatible accessories. The result is a roof that can function for decades without intervention — critical for logistics operators whose business cannot tolerate production disruptions caused by roof leaks.

### Manufacturing and Assembly Facilities

Manufacturing and assembly plants present greater complexity than pure warehouses: penetrations for industrial ventilation units, electrical cable entries, sprinkler systems, boiler flues, process pipework passages and equipment support anchors. Each represents a potential water entry point if not correctly addressed in the waterproofing system. Membriko has extensive experience with high-penetration-density projects. EPDM is the material that adapts best to this reality: prefabricated EPDM pipe boots accommodate circular penetrations without cutting and folding flat sheet; EPDM flashing tape and compatible sealant handle irregular penetration geometries; and every penetration is treated as a construction detail project in its own right, not an afterthought.

### Food-Processing Plants

Food-processing plants impose additional requirements on the waterproofing membrane. The presence of vegetable oils, animal fats, salt solutions, alkaline cleaning detergents and de-scaling acids demands that the membrane resist all these agents without degradation. EPDM meets this requirement for the great majority of food-processing activities common in Portugal — olive oil processing, fish canning, cheese and dairy production, wine, cork, food packaging. Membriko specifies EPDM formulations without migrating plasticisers that could contaminate production spaces, and designs roof systems to facilitate routine cleaning and inspection in food-industry environments.

### Cold Storage and Refrigeration Facilities

A cold-storage warehouse roof is one of the most technically demanding projects in industrial construction. The thermal gradient between -25°C inside and 75°C on the exterior membrane surface in Portuguese summer creates expansion and contraction forces that destroy rigid membranes over few thermal cycles. High interior humidity and the vapour pressure differential between interior and exterior require a correctly positioned vapour control layer to prevent interstitial condensation within the insulation.

Membriko designs cold-storage roof systems as an integrated assembly: a high-performance vapour control layer on the warm side of the insulation, insulation thickness calculated to maintain the dew point within acceptable limits, and EPDM membrane as the exterior waterproofing layer. The hygrothermal calculation is performed by Membriko for every cold-storage project, verifying that the system functions correctly across all temperature and humidity conditions expected throughout the year in Portugal.

### Mixed-Use Industrial Parks and Multi-Tenant Facilities

Industrial parks and multi-tenant pavilions present the challenge of phased installation: different buildings or bays are constructed or renovated at different times, tenants change, and the roof must be serviceable in partial zones without affecting adjacent operational areas. EPDM adapts to this reality better than bituminous systems: joints between installation phases are made with high-strength EPDM splice tape, and newly installed zones integrate seamlessly with existing membrane without requiring coverage of the entire roof area. Membriko plans phased industrial installations specifically to maintain the waterproofing integrity of completed sections during ongoing work on adjacent areas.

## The Large-Sheet Advantage in Detail

The decision to use large-format EPDM sheets is not merely a logistical preference — it is an engineering decision with measurable consequences for reliability and long-term cost.

### The Mathematics of Joint Count

Consider an industrial building with a 60-metre-long, 40-metre-wide roof — total area of 2,400 m². To cover this area:

- **EPDM (Membriko)** in 15.25 m wide sheets: three sheets spanning the width, creating two longitudinal joints of 60 metres each — total 120 linear metres of joint.
- **TPO in 1.5 m effective width rolls**: 27 rolls running longitudinally, creating 26 joints of 40 metres each — total 1,040 linear metres of joint.
- **Modified bitumen SBS in 1.0 m effective width rolls**: 40 rolls running longitudinally, creating 39 joints of 40 metres each — total 1,560 linear metres of joint.

The joint reduction with EPDM is approximately 88% relative to TPO and 92% relative to bitumen. If the probability of joint failure per linear metre per year is equal across systems — a conservative assumption, since EPDM butyl tape joints are frequently more durable than aged TPO heat welds — the reduction in infiltration probability from joint failure is proportional to the reduction in linear metres. The practical implication is straightforward: over a 20-year period, a Membriko EPDM roof with 120 metres of joints will have had significantly fewer joint-related problems than a TPO roof with 1,040 metres of joints on the same building.

### Custom-Fabricated Sheets for Major Projects

Membriko works with manufacturers who produce custom-dimensioned EPDM sheets for large projects. For a warehouse 15 metres wide and 80 metres long, it is possible to order a single sheet of 15.25 m × 80 m that covers the full width of the building in one piece, with the only joint occurring at the ridge if the building has a twin-pitched roof. This custom fabrication capability — which Membriko mobilises systematically on its largest industrial projects — eliminates the transverse field joints that would otherwise be required when multiple roll lengths are joined end to end.

## Installation on Steel Deck and Concrete Substrates

### Trapezoidal Steel Decking

Trapezoidal steel sheet is the most common roof substrate on Portuguese industrial buildings constructed since the 1990s. EPDM installation on steel deck is technically well-established, but requires careful consideration of factors specific to this substrate.

**Mechanical fastening**: The standard method for trapezoidal steel deck. Stainless steel screw fasteners are installed through the insulation into the raised ribs of the deck profile, with load-spreading plates that distribute stress and prevent point loading of the membrane. Membriko calculates fastening patterns in accordance with EN 1991-1-4, providing higher fastener densities in edge and corner zones where negative wind pressure (suction) is greatest.

**Integrated thermal insulation**: In the great majority of industrial projects, EPDM is installed over a layer of thermal insulation — PIR (polyisocyanurate), mineral wool, or EPS — that in turn bears on the steel deck. The insulation is mechanically fastened to the deck with specialist fasteners, and the EPDM membrane is then installed over the insulation. Membriko designs the complete fastening sequence to ensure that the membrane fasteners pass through the insulation and anchor in the deck, providing system stability under wind loading.

**Thermal movement accommodation**: Steel sheet expands and contracts with temperature far more than concrete. Membriko specifies mechanical fastening rather than full adhesive bonding for steel deck roofs — the mechanically fastened system accommodates differential thermal movement of the metallic substrate without developing tensile stress in the membrane that could fatigue the bond over time.

### Precast Prestressed Concrete and In-Situ Slabs

Older industrial buildings — many constructed between the 1960s and 1980s — have concrete roof structures: precast prestressed elements (hollow-core planks, prestressed T-sections, rib-and-block systems) or in-situ reinforced concrete slabs. These substrates are excellent for EPDM installation in fully bonded systems, provided substrate preparation is adequate.

Membriko always performs a substrate assessment before any concrete installation: surface tensile strength testing (pull-off test), contamination assessment (grease, mould-release agents, paint), planarity verification (surface regularisation required for irregularities exceeding 5 mm in 2 metres), and moisture content measurement (below 6% by weight before adhesive application). On rehabilitation projects where an existing waterproofing system must be removed, Membriko systematically assesses the condition of the underlying concrete and carries out any necessary repairs before installing the new EPDM system.

### Membriko's 7-Step Industrial Installation Process

EPDM industrial roofing installation by Membriko follows a structured process that ensures quality and traceability at every stage.

**Step 1 — Survey and diagnosis**: Complete survey of dimensions, substrate condition, penetrations, drainage conditions and roof access. On rehabilitation projects, this includes assessment of the existing system and identification of areas with active moisture.

**Step 2 — System design**: Based on the survey, Membriko defines the complete system: membrane thickness and type, fixing system, insulation specification (if required), vapour control layer (if required), and a sheet-by-sheet layout plan with joint locations and perimeter detail designs.

**Step 3 — Substrate preparation**: Cleaning, surface regularisation and adhesion primer (for bonded systems). Concrete repair or steel sheet corrosion treatment as required. Vapour control layer installation where specified.

**Step 4 — Insulation installation**: Where required, insulation boards are installed over the prepared substrate with staggered joints to avoid linear thermal bridges, fixed mechanically or adhesively to the substrate.

**Step 5 — EPDM membrane installation**: Membrane sheets are positioned in accordance with the installation plan. For mechanically fastened systems, fasteners are installed through the membrane and insulation into the deck at calculated spacings. For bonded systems, contact adhesive is applied to both surfaces and the membrane is bonded after correct evaporation time, working from the centre outward to avoid trapped air.

**Step 6 — Joints and details**: Sheet-to-sheet joints are made with butyl tape and EPDM cover tape. All perimeter details, upstands, flashings and penetrations are completed with system-compatible accessories — prefabricated pipe boots, metal termination bars sealed with polyurethane mastic, pre-formed inside and outside corners.

**Step 7 — Inspection and handover**: Systematic inspection of the entire membrane surface, all joints and all construction details. Water-tightness testing at critical zones where required. Client handover of the complete project file: technical data sheets, performance declarations, inspection report and maintenance recommendations.

## Chemical and Environmental Resistance in Industrial Context

### The Mechanism of EPDM's Resistance

EPDM's chemical resistance is a direct consequence of its molecular structure. The polymer backbone — saturated ethylene-propylene chains — is non-polar, which means it does not react with polar substances (water, dilute acids, dilute alkalis) and resists absorption of non-aliphatic organic fluids. The cross-linking introduced by vulcanisation ensures that even if solvent molecules intercalate between polymer chains, the membrane retains its structural integrity and does not delaminate or dissolve.

### Industrial Environments Where EPDM Demonstrates Superiority

**Food and agro-industrial processing**: Resistant to cooking oils, animal fats, salt solutions, alkaline detergents (dilute sodium hydroxide solutions), and organic acids (acetic acid, citric acid). Membriko has installed EPDM systems on olive oil processing facilities, fish canneries, industrial dairies, and food-packaging plants across several Portuguese regions.

**Agricultural storage and cork processing**: Resistant to water-based pesticide solutions, copper sulphate solutions, cork dust in aqueous suspension, and the high humidity associated with the storage of agricultural produce and cork.

**Plastics and rubber manufacturing**: Resistant to many plasticisers, water-based lubricants and non-aromatic release agents.

**Waste treatment and recycling facilities**: Resistant to municipal solid-waste leachate, low-concentration effluents and contaminated aqueous solutions.

### Transparent Disclosure of Limitations

Membriko is rigorous about communicating where EPDM is not appropriate. For installations with direct, sustained exposure to:

- Concentrated aromatic hydrocarbons (petrol, toluene, xylene, benzene)
- Mineral oils in significant quantity (fuel stations, heavy vehicle maintenance workshops)
- Halogenated solvents (chloroform, dichloromethane)

...Membriko recommends specialised alternative membranes and directs the client to the technically appropriate solution — even when that solution is not EPDM.

## EPDM vs TPO vs PVC vs Bitumen for Industrial Roofing

Comparing waterproofing systems for industrial applications requires rigour and honesty. Membriko presents this analysis without hidden bias.

| Criterion | EPDM (Membriko) | TPO | PVC | Modified Bitumen SBS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Maximum sheet/roll width | 15.25 m | 2.0 m | 2.0 m | 1.0 m |
| Joints per 5,000 m² (example) | ~6 | ~30 | ~30 | ~50 |
| Joint method | Butyl tape / adhesive | Hot-air weld | Hot-air weld | Torch / self-adhesive |
| Elongation at break | ≥300% | ≤30% | ≤20% | ≤50% (deteriorating) |
| Resistance to animal fats | Excellent | Good | Moderate | Poor |
| Resistance to aliphatic hydrocarbons | Moderate | Moderate | Poor | Very poor |
| Maximum service temperature | +130°C | +115°C | +80°C | +70°C (softens) |
| Standard solar reflectance | Grey (low) | White (high) | White (high) | Grey/granule |
| Cold installation (no flame) | Yes | No (welding) | No (welding) | No (torch) |
| Expected service life | 50+ years | 20-30 years | 15-25 years | 15-20 years |
| Estimated 50-year total cost | Low | Medium | Medium-high | High (replacement cycles) |

### TPO and the Cool Roof Argument

White TPO has been aggressively marketed as a cool-roof solution for industrial buildings, on the basis that its light-coloured surface reflects solar radiation and reduces heat gain. The technical argument is valid — a white TPO with an SRI (Solar Reflectance Index) of 95+ reflects substantially more solar energy than a standard grey EPDM.

Membriko's response has two parts. First: EPDM is also available in white or with high-reflectance surface coatings, achieving SRI values comparable to white TPO — the cool-roof argument is not exclusive to TPO. Second: in Portugal's climate, with abundant sun but cold winters, the annual energy balance of a high-reflectance versus a low-reflectance roof depends on latitude, orientation and the building's mechanical system. For non-conditioned industrial spaces — the majority of Portuguese warehouses — the cool-roof benefit is limited. For conditioned industrial spaces (distribution centres, server rooms, pharmaceutical facilities), Membriko specifies high-reflectance EPDM when the energy calculation justifies it. The correct answer depends on the specific project, not on a marketing preference for one membrane colour.

## Energy Efficiency in Industrial Roofing

### The Roof's Impact on Industrial Energy Consumption

The roof of an industrial building typically represents 30 to 50 per cent of the total exterior envelope area, making it the principal surface through which solar energy enters the building envelope. In Portugal, where annual average solar irradiance ranges from approximately 1,500 kWh/m² in the North to 1,900 kWh/m² in the South, management of solar gains through the roof is a factor with genuine impact on cooling energy consumption in conditioned industrial spaces and on thermal comfort in unconditioned ones.

Membriko addresses energy efficiency in industrial roofing in two dimensions.

**Thermal insulation**: Insulation thickness is calculated to satisfy the RECS (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Comércio e Serviços) requirements for conditioned industrial buildings, while minimising thermal bridges at mechanical fastening points. Membriko uses thermal-break fasteners in projects where psi-value calculations identify significant linear thermal bridges through conventional fasteners.

**Solar reflectance**: Where the energy study justifies the specification, Membriko specifies white EPDM (SRI ≥ 78) or EPDM with a reflective surface coating. For buildings with a finished ceiling directly below the roof, the membrane colour has direct impact on the ceiling slab temperature, which in turn affects cooling loads. For unconditioned buildings, standard grey membrane is frequently the economically correct specification.

### EPDM and Photovoltaic Energy on Industrial Roofs

Large-area industrial roofs are ideal for photovoltaic installation. The flat roof geometry permits south-facing panel orientation at optimal inclination without the constraint of matching the building's roof pitch. Membriko has extensive experience installing EPDM on industrial roofs integrated with self-consumption PV systems, and is fully familiar with the requirements of this combination:

- PV mounting system rail anchors and fasteners that penetrate the membrane are treated with prefabricated EPDM pipe boots or system-specific penetration accessories, maintaining membrane integrity at every penetration point.
- The EPDM membrane remains accessible for inspection and panel cleaning without risk of mechanical damage, provided that EPDM walk pads are installed in maintenance traffic zones.
- EPDM's expected service life of 50 or more years exceeds the anticipated service life of the PV system (25 to 30 years), meaning the membrane does not require replacement over two photovoltaic system life cycles.

## Fire Safety Compliance for Industrial Buildings

### Applicable Standards and Classification

In Portugal, industrial buildings are subject to the Regime Jurídico de Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios (DL 220/2008) and Portaria 1532/2008, which defines technical conditions for different risk categories in industrial establishments. The fire behaviour of roof covering systems is classified according to European standard EN 13501-1, with the relevant classification for external roof surfaces being BROOF(t3) — external fire resistance in a 30-minute test.

The EPDM membranes specified and installed by Membriko carry BROOF(t3) classification when tested as a complete system (membrane plus substrate), in full compliance with Portuguese regulatory requirements for industrial building applications. Fire classification documentation is provided by Membriko with every project, forming part of the conformity dossier delivered to the client on completion of works.

### Cold Installation: A Safety Advantage in Operational Facilities

For industrial buildings that remain in operation during roofing works — which is the case for the great majority of industrial waterproofing rehabilitation projects — the absence of open flame during EPDM installation is a safety advantage with immediate practical consequences.

Modified bitumen torch installation in proximity to process equipment, flammable materials storage or industrial gas installations is frequently prohibited by industrial safety departments, forcing partial or total production shutdowns while roofing works are underway. Membriko, using EPDM installed with contact adhesive and mechanical fasteners, generates no flame, no sparks and no combustion gases — permitting roofing works to proceed in parallel with industrial production, subject to a coordinated safety plan agreed with the client's safety officer.

### Fixing Systems for Industrial Applications

**Mechanically fastened system**: Preferred for trapezoidal steel deck. Stainless steel screw fasteners with load-spreading plates, at densities calculated by roof zone (central field, edge zone, corner zone) according to EN 1991-1-4 for the local reference wind speed.

**Fully bonded system**: Preferred for flat concrete substrates with adequate surface tensile strength. Solvent-based or water-based contact adhesive applied to both surfaces; requires dry substrate (moisture content below 6% by weight) and application temperature between 5°C and 35°C.

**Ballasted system**: Only for flat roofs without frequent access. Washed gravel ballast (50 to 80 mm diameter, minimum 80 kg/m²) or concrete paving slabs. Requires no fasteners but imposes dead load that must be verified structurally.

## Maintenance with Minimal Operational Disruption

### EPDM's Low In-Service Maintenance Requirement

One of EPDM's most significant and least frequently communicated advantages is its low maintenance cost during service life. Unlike modified bitumen — which requires active inspection and maintenance (crack repair, reflective coating renewal, granule clearing at drainage points) at three-to-five-year intervals — correctly installed EPDM requires only:

- **Annual visual inspection**: perimeter check, penetration and joint inspection, drain condition; typically takes two to four hours for a 5,000 m² roof.
- **Detailed inspection every five years**: technical inspection with joint adhesion testing and termination accessory condition assessment.
- **Occasional cleaning**: removal of sediment and organic matter accumulated at drainage channels and drain outlets; frequency depends on local vegetation and air pollution levels.

Spot repairs on EPDM are simple and rapid: a cut or puncture is repaired with an EPDM patch bonded with contact adhesive and sealed with flashing tape, with no torch work, no hot works permit requirement and no interruption to operations below. This characteristic is particularly valued by industrial operators who cannot accept production disruptions for roof maintenance.

### Membriko Maintenance Contracts for Industrial Facilities

Membriko offers maintenance contracts tailored for industrial installations, including periodic inspections with technical reports, priority repairs in the event of accidental membrane damage, and guaranteed 48-hour response for emergency calls related to roof infiltration. For industrial groups with multiple facilities within Membriko's service area — the Centre of Portugal and adjacent regions — multi-facility maintenance contracts provide significant economies of scale.

## Portuguese Industrial Zones: Membriko's Presence and Reach

### The Home Market: Centre of Portugal

Membriko operates from Pombal, a central location on the EN1/A1 industrial corridor that concentrates one of the highest densities of industrial and logistics facilities in Portugal. In this zone of immediate proximity, Membriko can mobilise rapidly, has detailed knowledge of local climatic and wind conditions, and maintains established relationships with the principal industrial property developers and facility managers.

Industrial installations in Leiria, Pombal, Coimbra, Figueira da Foz, Marinha Grande, Ansião, Soure and adjacent municipalities benefit from significantly reduced response times and mobilisation costs when working with Membriko.

### Greater Lisbon and Setúbal

The industrial pole of the Setúbal Peninsula — Palmela (Autoeuropa), Setúbal, Montijo — and the industrial parks north of Lisbon (Loures, Sintra, Odivelas) represent a concentration of large-scale industrial buildings with regular waterproofing requirements. Membriko covers this area with dedicated teams and logistics for large-scale projects.

### Greater Porto and Aveiro

Matosinhos (refining, petrochemicals), Maia (logistics, distribution), Aveiro (diversified manufacturing), Braga and Guimarães (textiles, footwear, metalworking) concentrate a significant share of Portugal's industrial building stock. Membriko deploys teams to this region for suitably sized projects, with logistics planned to minimise travel and maximise installation efficiency.

### Alentejo and Algarve

The Alentejo interior — Évora, Beja, Elvas — has been attracting increasing agro-industrial and logistics investment, supported by improved road infrastructure and competitive land prices. The Algarve has a smaller industrial base but includes food-processing facilities (fish canning, dairy) and logistics operations serving the tourism sector. Membriko serves these regions based on project volume and scheduling, delivering the same standard of execution regardless of location.

## Cost-Benefit for Large Industrial Areas

### The Total Cost of Ownership Model

Evaluating a waterproofing system on the basis of initial installation cost alone is an economically irrational approach that consistently leads to higher long-term costs. The total cost of ownership over a building's service life includes:

1. **Initial installation cost**: Materials + labour + mobilisation
2. **Annual maintenance cost**: Inspections, minor repairs, cleaning
3. **Major intervention costs**: Joint repairs, accessory replacement, infiltration remediation
4. **Replacement cost**: Removal of failed system plus installation of new system when service life ends
5. **Internal damage costs**: Costs of infiltration on stored goods, process equipment or production interruption

When total cost of ownership is considered across 50 years for a 10,000 m² industrial warehouse, EPDM installed by Membriko is consistently less expensive than any alternative. The reason is straightforward: EPDM does not need to be replaced after 15 to 20 years, as bitumen or PVC do. A quality EPDM installation, properly maintained, lasts 50 or more years. The replacement cost — which for a bituminous system must be paid at least once, and frequently twice, across a 50-year period — is eliminated.

### Indicative Cost Estimates (Portugal, 2025–2026)

The figures below are indicative and subject to variation based on project complexity, access conditions, location and specific substrate condition. Membriko provides detailed quotations after a free technical site visit.

**EPDM (1.5 mm, mechanically fastened system over insulation)**:
- Initial installation: €25–40/m² (membrane only) to €40–65/m² (with PIR insulation included)
- Estimated annual maintenance: €0.20–0.50/m²/year
- Replacement at 50 years: Not required
- **Estimated total cost over 50 years: €35–75/m²**

**Modified bitumen SBS (two layers, with granule surface and reflective paint)**:
- Initial installation: €18–30/m²
- Estimated annual maintenance: €0.80–1.50/m²/year
- Replacement at 15–20 years: €20–32/m² (first replacement) + €20–32/m² (second replacement at 35–40 years)
- **Estimated total cost over 50 years: €90–165/m²**

The difference is substantial. Membriko presents this model transparently to every industrial client — not as a sales device, but as a rational decision-making tool.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which membrane is most suitable for a large industrial warehouse?**

A: For large-area industrial buildings — from 1,000 m² upwards — Membriko systematically recommends EPDM in large-format sheets. The reason is the dramatic reduction in joint count that EPDM's sheet width makes possible, which translates directly into greater long-term reliability. For a 5,000 m² building, Membriko installs EPDM with fewer than ten joints in total; an equivalent bituminous system would have more than 50 joints. Every joint is a risk — eliminating joints eliminates risk. Membriko evaluates every project individually and presents the technically most appropriate solution for the specific geometry, substrate and use of the building.

**Q: Can EPDM withstand the chemicals used in our factory?**

A: It depends on the specific chemicals. EPDM is resistant to dilute acids, dilute alkalis, water, animal and vegetable fats, vegetable oils, salt solutions, alkaline cleaning detergents and many common industrial process fluids. It is not suitable for direct, prolonged contact with concentrated aromatic hydrocarbons (petrol, toluene) or chlorinated solvents. Membriko carries out a chemical compatibility assessment for every industrial project before specifying the system — provide us with the safety data sheets for the substances in question and we will confirm EPDM compatibility or recommend the most appropriate alternative.

**Q: How is EPDM installed on trapezoidal steel decking?**

A: Membriko's standard method for trapezoidal steel deck is the mechanically fastened system: stainless steel screw fasteners are installed through the insulation into the raised ribs of the deck profile, with load-spreading plates to distribute stress, at densities calculated according to EN 1991-1-4 for the local wind zone. Insulation is installed first, over the steel deck, and the EPDM membrane is then installed over the insulation. Joints between sheets are made with butyl tape and EPDM cover tape. The system accommodates the thermal movement of the steel substrate without developing membrane stress — something a fully bonded system would not reliably achieve on a metal deck.

**Q: Is it possible to install EPDM without interrupting factory production?**

A: Yes — and this is one of the primary reasons Membriko recommends EPDM for the rehabilitation of operational industrial roofs. Installation is cold, with no open flame, no torch and no welding that generates sparks. Works can be planned in phases that allow production to continue below, subject to a safety plan coordinated with the facility's safety officer. Membriko has experience executing projects in fully operational industrial facilities, including food-industry installations with HACCP requirements, and can prepare specific phasing plans for each situation.

**Q: What is the difference between EPDM and TPO for industrial roofing?**

A: The most important difference is sheet width: EPDM is available up to 15.25 metres wide; TPO rarely exceeds 2 metres. On a large industrial roof, this means eight to ten times more joints with TPO than with EPDM. White TPO has higher standard solar reflectance, but EPDM is also available in white. TPO joints made by hot-air welding are technically robust when correctly executed, but the welding equipment represents a risk of thermal damage to foam insulation substrates if improperly controlled. TPO's long-term durability in Mediterranean climates such as Portugal's is less well-documented than EPDM's, which has 50 years of field data across diverse climatic conditions. For large-area industrial roofs, EPDM has, in Membriko's technical assessment, a superior reliability argument by virtue of having substantially fewer joints.

**Q: Is EPDM suitable for cold storage warehouses?**

A: Yes, and it is frequently the best choice. EPDM retains its flexibility and elasticity properties down to -45°C, which is essential on refrigerated facility roofs where thermal gradients are extreme. The roof system for a cold-storage warehouse necessarily includes a high-performance vapour control layer on the warm side of the insulation — Membriko designs and installs this component as an integral part of the system, with a hygrothermal calculation to verify that the dew point does not occur within the insulation layer under any temperature and humidity condition expected during the year in Portugal.

**Q: How long does it take to waterproof a 5,000 m² industrial facility?**

A: For a 5,000 m² building with a substrate in good condition and without exceptional complexity (high penetration density, irregular geometry, difficult access), Membriko typically estimates five to ten working days for the complete membrane installation and all construction details, depending on the number of teams deployed and weather conditions. Substrate preparation, where required, may add two to five days. The exact programme is confirmed in the proposal, with a detailed works schedule that allows the client to plan their operations around the roofing works.

**Q: What is the cost per square metre of industrial waterproofing with EPDM?**

A: The cost varies with membrane thickness, fixing system, inclusion and thickness of insulation, project complexity (penetrations, geometry, access conditions) and location. As indicative reference figures for Portugal in 2025–2026: 1.5 mm EPDM in a mechanically fastened system without insulation costs approximately €25 to €35/m² installed; with 80 mm PIR insulation included, the cost rises to approximately €45 to €65/m².

## Contact Membriko

The industrial roof is a long-term investment that protects assets far more valuable than the waterproofing system itself: stock, production equipment, operational continuity and the facility's commercial reputation. Membriko, EPDM waterproofing specialists based in Pombal, has the technical expertise, the process rigour and the quality materials to ensure that your industrial roof performs for decades without unpleasant surprises.

Do not accept a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Every bituminous membrane replacement cycle on a large industrial warehouse costs tens of thousands of euros and implies operational disruption. Membriko installs once, correctly, and ensures that the client does not need to think about the roof for the next 50 years.

Contact Membriko to arrange a no-obligation technical site visit. The survey is free. The quotation is detailed, transparent and free of hidden costs. The result is industrial waterproofing that lasts — and that protects what truly matters.
