# Industrial Buildings (Edifícios Industriais) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Industrial buildings represent the single largest segment of flat and low-slope roof waterproofing
in Portugal and across Europe. Warehouses, manufacturing facilities, logistics hubs, food-processing
plants, automotive assembly plants, cold-storage facilities and industrial parks typically feature
large-span flat or near-flat roofs that demand a waterproofing system capable of performing across
decades with minimal maintenance, regardless of operational conditions below and environmental
exposure above.

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) rubber membrane is the technically preferred primary
waterproofing solution for industrial roofing in Northern Europe, where it has dominated the
market since the 1970s. In Portugal, EPDM penetration in the industrial roofing sector remains
below its northern European counterpart — partly due to legacy familiarity with bituminous systems
and partly due to the historical dominance of light-gauge steel profile sheet in new-build industrial
construction. However, the economic logic of EPDM for large-area industrial roofing is
unambiguous: a single correctly installed EPDM membrane on a 10,000 m² warehouse roof will
outperform, in terms of total cost of ownership over 50 years, every bituminous or TPO alternative
currently available.

## The Portuguese Industrial Building Stock

Portugal's industrial property sector has undergone significant change since the country's EU
accession in 1986. The manufacturing base, concentrated in the Lisbon metropolitan area, the
Greater Porto region, and industrial parks along the A1 corridor (Setúbal, Palmela, Montijo,
Aveiro, Braga), includes a substantial volume of buildings constructed between 1980 and 2010
with original roofing systems that have reached or exceeded their design life.

Key industrial zones relevant to the EPDM waterproofing market:

- **Centro de Portugal** — Pombal, Leiria, Coimbra and the EN1/A1 industrial corridor. This is
  the immediate geographic market for Membriko, which operates from Pombal.
- **Grande Lisboa** — Setúbal Peninsula (Autoeuropa, logistics), Loures, Sintra industrial estates
- **Grande Porto** — Maia, Matosinhos (oil refining, food processing), Aveiro, Braga (automotive)
- **Alentejo** — Évora, Beja (agro-industrial, logistics)
- **Algarve** — Lagoa, Portimão (light industrial, food processing)

Industrial buildings in these zones present heterogeneous roofing substrates: trapezoidal steel
decking (the most common new-build substrate since the 1990s), precast prestressed concrete
planks (common in older warehouses and food-industry buildings where fire resistance is critical),
in-situ reinforced concrete slabs (heavy-industry buildings, chemical plants), and timber or
composite decking (light industrial and agricultural buildings).

## Why Industrial Roofs Demand EPDM

### Scale: The Large-Area Advantage

Industrial roofs are measured in thousands of square metres, not hundreds. A single EPDM sheet
can be manufactured up to 15.25 m wide and 61 m long — an area of approximately 930 m² from a
single piece. For a 5,000 m² warehouse roof, a correctly planned installation requires fewer than
six field seams running the length of the building. This is transformative for reliability: each
seam is a potential failure point, and eliminating seams eliminates failure opportunities in
proportion.

The mathematics are clear when compared to alternatives. A 1,200 mm wide bituminous modified
bitumen roll requires approximately 48 seams to cover the same 5,000 m² roof (at 1.5 m effective
width with 150 mm overlap). A 2,000 mm wide TPO roll requires approximately 30 seams. EPDM in
15,250 mm sheets requires 6 seams. The probability of at least one seam failure over 30 years
is dramatically lower with EPDM.

### Chemical Resistance: The Industrial Environment

Industrial facilities generate or process chemicals that attack conventional waterproofing
membranes. Bituminous membranes — SBS or APP modified — are susceptible to aromatic solvents,
petroleum derivatives, animal fats and certain industrial oils. These substances dissolve the
bitumen binder and cause progressive delamination that is often not visible until the membrane
has failed completely.

EPDM's non-polar polymer structure makes it resistant to a wide range of polar solvents, dilute
acids, dilute alkalis, animal fats, vegetable oils and many industrial process fluids. It is
not resistant to aromatic hydrocarbons (petrol, toluene, xylene) or aliphatic hydrocarbon
solvents in direct contact — an important limitation for petroleum storage and refinery applications
where a more chemically specialised membrane may be required. However, for the vast majority of
Portuguese industrial building types — food processing, cold storage, general manufacturing,
logistics — EPDM's chemical resistance is superior to alternatives.

### Temperature Resistance: From Cold Storage to High-Bay Heat

Industrial facilities impose unusual thermal conditions on their roofs. Cold-storage and
refrigerated logistics facilities operate at interior temperatures of -25°C to +4°C, creating
large thermal gradients between the interior and a roof membrane that may reach 70-80°C in
Portuguese summer sun. These gradients drive condensation risk and impose severe thermal
mechanical stress cycles on the waterproofing membrane.

High-bay manufacturing and logistics buildings — often 12-18 m in internal height — can develop
elevated interior temperatures in summer as heat stratifies at roof level. The membrane must
withstand both the surface temperature (potentially 80°C on a dark-coloured membrane in August
in Alentejo) and the thermal cycling as the building heats and cools daily.

EPDM's service range of -45°C to +130°C provides ample margin for all Portuguese industrial
conditions. Its thermal cycling fatigue resistance — the ability to endure thousands of
heat/cool cycles without microcracking or delamination — is well-documented in laboratory studies
and confirmed by field performance data from northern European industrial buildings where EPDM
membranes installed in the 1980s are still in service.

### Lightweight: Structural Load Advantage

Industrial roof structures, particularly steel-framed buildings with trapezoidal steel decking,
are designed with specific dead-load limits for the roofing system. EPDM membrane weighs
approximately 1.5-2.0 kg/m² for a standard 1.5 mm membrane with adhesive, compared to
5-8 kg/m² for a double-layer SBS bituminous system and 2.5-4.0 kg/m² for a single-layer
TPO system with insulation boards mechanically fastened. For existing structures where the
additional dead load of a new waterproofing system is constrained by structural capacity, EPDM's
low weight is often the decisive factor.

### Fire Behaviour: European Classification

Portuguese building regulations and EN 13501-1 classify roofing membrane systems according to
fire reaction. EPDM membranes are classified BROOF(t3) or better when tested as a complete
system (membrane + substrate), which satisfies the requirements of the Portuguese Technical
Building Regulation (RJUE and DTU equivalent) for industrial buildings, including those with
fire-load classification under Portuguese SCIE (Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios) rules.
The cold installation method — no open flame, no torch — also reduces fire risk during installation
on operational industrial facilities where torch work near flammable materials is often prohibited.

## Competitive Landscape in Portuguese Industrial Roofing

### Bituminous Systems (SBS/APP Modified Bitumen)

Still the volume-dominant system in Portugal across all building types. In the industrial
segment, bituminous systems are specified largely by habit and procurement familiarity. A two-layer
SBS system installed correctly has a realistic service life of 15-20 years in the Portuguese
climate — adequate in the 1980s and 1990s when most Portuguese industrial stock was built, but
inadequate as a specification basis for new or renovated industrial buildings today given that
the buildings themselves are expected to serve for 50+ years.

Key disadvantages for industrial applications: susceptibility to chemical contamination from
industrial processes; fire risk during torch application in operational facilities; high seam count
on large-area roofs; degradation by thermal cycling (loss of modifiers from bitumen binder over
time); and the need for UV-protective granule surfacing or solar reflective paint that degrades
and must be maintained.

### TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)

TPO has gained market share in Portuguese industrial roofing in the 2010s, driven partly by
the cool-roof demand and partly by European manufacturer marketing. TPO's hot-air welded seams
are stronger than adhesive-joined EPDM seams and the light-coloured (typically white) surface
provides inherently high solar reflectance (SRI 80-100) without additional coating.

However, TPO's limitation for large industrial roofs is roll width: standard TPO is produced in
1,500-2,000 mm rolls, requiring significantly more seams than EPDM sheets. TPO's long-term
UV durability in Mediterranean climates is also less well-documented than EPDM's, with field
data from Southern European installations showing earlier loss of tensile properties than
northern European equivalents.

### PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)

PVC was the dominant single-ply industrial roofing membrane in Portugal in the 1990s and early
2000s. Its primary limitation for industrial applications is chemical compatibility: the plasticiser
content in PVC membranes makes them susceptible to leaching when in contact with bituminous
substrates, certain adhesives, and industrial process fluids including mineral oils. In food
industry applications, certain PVC plasticisers raise food-safety concerns that drive specification
away from PVC. PVC's service life in Mediterranean climates is typically 15-25 years, shorter
than EPDM.

## Research Gaps

- No peer-reviewed Portuguese study specifically quantifying EPDM vs bituminous total cost of
  ownership for industrial buildings has been published as of early 2026
- Chemical resistance data for EPDM specifically relevant to Portuguese agro-industrial process
  fluids (olive oil, wine must, cork dust environments) is available from manufacturers but not
  from independent Portuguese-language sources
- Thermal performance monitoring data for cool-roof EPDM systems on Portuguese industrial buildings
  is largely absent from the published literature; manufacturer-cited SRI values are tested under
  ASTM E1980 conditions, not under Portuguese solar irradiance conditions specifically
