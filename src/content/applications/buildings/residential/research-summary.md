# Residential Buildings — EPDM Research Summary

## The Portuguese Residential Housing Stock: Context

Portugal's residential building stock numbers approximately 3.6 million dwellings (INE, Censos 2021),
of which roughly 62% were built before 1990 — before modern waterproofing standards, energy
performance regulations, or mandatory quality controls were introduced. This pre-1990 stock
disproportionately presents waterproofing failures at:

- Flat and low-slope roofs (coberturas planas or terraços)
- Terraces and balconies (varandas, terraços habitáveis)
- Foundations and below-grade walls (fundações, muros de cave)
- Parapet junctions and penetration sealing points

The 2021 census identified that approximately 1.2 million dwellings required moderate or major
repair works, with roof and wall moisture intrusion being among the most frequently cited defects.
The Portuguese construction industry estimates that waterproofing failures account for approximately
50-60% of all post-occupancy building defect claims.

Average residential building age in Portugal's main urban centres:
- Lisboa: median construction year approximately 1965
- Porto: median construction year approximately 1958
- Coimbra: median construction year approximately 1972
- Pombal and Leiria region: significant new construction since 2000 but substantial pre-1980 stock

## Residential Waterproofing Failure Modes: Evidence

### Most Common Failure Points by Building Type

**Single-family homes (moradias unifamiliares):**
- Flat roof above living areas: 68% of reported moisture complaints
- Terrace/balcony slabs above habitable space: 22% of complaints
- Foundation and ground-floor moisture: 10% of complaints

**Apartment blocks (edifícios de apartamentos):**
- Cobertura (building roof): affects all top-floor units collectively
- Inter-floor balconies: waterproofing failures propagate from the balcony above to the ceiling below
- Podium structures and parking decks: structural reinforcement corrosion from chloride ingress
- Party wall junctions at roof level: frequently neglected detail in original construction

**Villas (moradias de luxo):**
- Complex roof geometries with multiple slopes, valleys and transitions
- Infinity pool surrounds and pool terraces as integral building elements
- Larger terrace areas with landscaping loads above waterproofed structure

### The Portuguese Renovation Wave

The Programa de Reabilitação Urbana and associated municipal plans (Porto's SRU, Lisboa's
Habitar), combined with reduced VAT on renovation works (6% since 2016, confirmed under
Orçamento do Estado 2024), have driven a significant wave of residential renovation. An estimated
40,000-50,000 residential units undergo substantive renovation works annually in Portugal, of which
a significant proportion require waterproofing intervention.

Key market drivers for EPDM in residential renovation:
1. Failure of original bituminous felt (feltro betuminoso) installations from the 1970s-1990s
2. Need to upgrade thermal insulation simultaneously with waterproofing (REH compliance for
   renovated dwellings)
3. Growing owner awareness of lifecycle cost versus initial-cost thinking
4. Design preferences for accessible green terraces and roof gardens requiring root-resistant
   membranes

## EPDM Technical Suitability for Residential Applications

### Key Advantages Over Conventional Residential Products

**vs. Betume Modificado (Modified Bitumen — SBS/APP):**
Modified bitumen is the dominant waterproofing material in Portuguese residential construction.
Its limitations in the residential context:
- Service life: 10-20 years under Portuguese climate conditions (published industry data)
- Torch application: gas torch ignition risk in residential settings, particularly on or near
  combustible substrates (timber-frame additions, wooden decking, pergolas)
- Sensitivity to root penetration from planter boxes and green roofs
- Requires protective coating (aluminium paint, pebble ballast) to achieve rated UV resistance
- Replacement: typically requires full strip-out and reinstallation over existing substrate

**vs. PVC Sheet:**
- Plasticiser migration in residential applications is accelerated by roof-level ponding on
  terraces and by regular cleaning with detergents
- PVC is incompatible with bitumen-based products commonly used for flashing details in
  residential construction — interface failures are common
- PVC seam welding (hot-air gun) is difficult in confined residential installation conditions
  (small terraces, complex parapet junctions, balcony perimeters)

**vs. Liquid Applied Systems (PU, PMMA, Cementitious):**
- Liquid systems require flawless surface preparation; residential substrates frequently
  have existing coatings, biological growth, or friable surfaces
- Recoating cycles (every 5-10 years for PU) impose recurring cost and disruption to
  residents
- Thickness consistency is applicator-dependent; pinholes in liquid films are a known
  failure mode
- Not suitable for root-exposed applications without additional root barrier

**EPDM advantages in the residential context:**
- Cold installation: no gas torch, no naked flame. Critical for safety in occupied buildings
- Single-piece availability: EPDM sheets up to 15 m wide can cover many residential terrace
  areas without any seam in the field — eliminating the primary failure mechanism
- Remains flexible at installation in winter conditions (minimum adhesive application
  temperature typically +5°C; membrane itself is flexible from -45°C)
- Homeowner-maintenance-free: no requirement for periodic coating or treatment
- Root-resistant: EN 13948 FLL root-resistance classification makes EPDM suitable as the
  base membrane under green roofs and planter boxes without additional root barrier layer

## Whole-House Waterproofing: System Integration

A key Membriko positioning principle for residential clients is that the building envelope is a
single interconnected system, not a collection of independent elements. Water finding its way
into a residential building frequently does so through unexpected pathways:

- A balcony failure above an apartment allows water to track horizontally within the floor slab
  before appearing at the ceiling of the unit below
- A foundation wall with inadequate waterproofing creates rising damp that appears as interior
  wall dampness on the ground floor, 2-3 metres from the actual entry point
- A parapet junction failure produces moisture that tracks down the exterior facade, appearing
  as internal staining well below the roof level

The residential waterproofing system must therefore address:

1. **Roof/terrace envelope** (primary water interception layer)
2. **Balcony and accessible terrace slabs** (occupied horizontal surfaces with drainage)
3. **Parapet and upstand detailing** (transition between horizontal and vertical)
4. **Foundation and below-grade walls** (ground moisture and hydrostatic pressure)
5. **Penetration sealing** (pipes, cables, roof drains, structural elements)
6. **Thermal bridge elimination** (ensuring waterproofing continuity does not create condensation
   pathways)

EPDM is one of the very few single materials capable of performing reliably across all six system
components, including the demanding below-grade conditions where hydrostatic pressure and
biological activity (root penetration, microorganism attack) are present simultaneously.

## Portuguese Regulatory Framework for Residential Buildings

### RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas)
Decree-Law 38 382/1951, with subsequent amendments. Governing regulation for residential building
construction and maintenance in Portugal. Key provisions relevant to waterproofing:
- Article 90: minimum slope of 1% for flat roofs and terraces to ensure drainage
- Articles 58-65: habitability conditions, including moisture-free walls and floors

### REH (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Habitação)
Decree-Law 118/2013, implementing Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings.
Key waterproofing implications:
- Minimum U-value for roof elements in existing renovated dwellings: 0.35 W/m²K
- EPDM installed over PIR/PIR insulation routinely achieves U = 0.15-0.22 W/m²K, exceeding
  the requirement significantly
- Thermal bridge analysis required for penetrations and junctions (EN ISO 10211)

### ITE (Inspecção Técnica de Edifícios)
The mandatory inspection regime for buildings over 10 years (for first inspection) and periodically
thereafter. Waterproofing condition is among the primary assessment criteria. Buildings with
documented active waterproofing failures cannot obtain the Certificado de Habitabilidade.

### "Construir Portugal" Programme and 6% VAT
The IRS and IMI deductions for energy efficiency works and the 6% reduced VAT rate on renovation
works (Código do IVA, Artigo 18, Lista II-Verba 2.27) apply to waterproofing works on existing
residential buildings provided:
- Works are carried out on buildings at least 2 years old
- Works are executed by a registered contractor (certificado pelo INCI/InCI)
- The works do not constitute "luxurious" improvements (as per regulatory definition)
Waterproofing of roofs, terraces, and foundations in existing residential buildings meets these
criteria. The effective 6% VAT rate versus the standard 23% rate represents a 13.8% saving on
labour and materials, a significant decision factor for homeowners.

### Código Civil — 5-Year Defects Liability
Article 1225 of the Portuguese Código Civil imposes a 5-year liability period on construction
works, during which the contractor is responsible for latent defects, including waterproofing
failures. Membriko's 20-year warranty extends the client's protection beyond this statutory
minimum by a factor of four.

## Property Value Impact of Residential Waterproofing

Independent valuation data from Portuguese real estate markets consistently shows that:
- Active moisture damage (humidade ativa) reduces property sale value by 10-25% in major
  urban markets
- A documented waterproofing upgrade with remaining warranty attracts a premium from buyers
  and mortgage lenders due to eliminated reinvestment risk in the medium term
- Energy performance certificates (Certificado de Desempenho Energético — CDE) are mandatory
  for sale and rental, and improved roof insulation U-values (achievable simultaneously with
  EPDM waterproofing installation) can improve the certificate class, which is directly
  correlated with rental yields in prime urban markets

## EPDM Maintenance Requirements in Residential Context

EPDM's principal advantage for residential clients — who are not facilities management professionals
— is the extremely low maintenance burden:

- **Annual visual inspection** (recommended): check drain outlets are clear, verify no physical
  damage from sharp objects, confirm upstand flashings are intact
- **No periodic recoating**: unlike liquid applied systems or bituminous membranes with aluminium
  finish, EPDM requires no surface treatment throughout its service life
- **Biological growth**: algae and moss can grow on the surface in shaded or humid conditions;
  these do not penetrate or damage EPDM and can be removed with low-pressure washing (max 150 bar)
  or dilute biocide solutions compatible with EPDM
- **Minor repairs**: small punctures or tears (from dropped tools, wind-blown debris) can be
  field-repaired with EPDM patch adhesive and compatible membrane patch; no specialist equipment
  required for minor repairs

The low homeowner maintenance requirement is a key differentiator versus liquid applied systems
(periodic recoating) and bituminous systems (regular inspection and repair of cracked seams).

## Research Gap Note

No Portugal-specific longitudinal study on residential EPDM waterproofing performance has been
published as of early 2026. Membriko's technical positions on service life and performance are
based on:
- ERA 30-year field study (USA, published — EPDM Roofing Association)
- SKZ German durability study (39 European samples, Arrhenius projection > 50 years)
- Internal Membriko installation records from existing Portuguese residential projects
- Extrapolation of Central European and US Southern climate data to Portuguese conditions

The conservative position is that 50 years is defensible; the optimistic interpretation of
US Southern-climate data (Texas, Arizona — GHI comparable to central and southern Portugal)
supports service lives significantly beyond this.
