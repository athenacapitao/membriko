# Residential Building Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Portuguese Housing and the Moisture Problem

There is a moment that many Portuguese homeowners know all too well: the morning after a night
of heavy autumn rain when the first dark patches appear on the living room ceiling, the paint
begins to blister on the top-floor bedroom wall, or the smell of damp pervades the basement
corridor. This is not an accident or an isolated failure. It is the predictable consequence of
a housing stock in which more than 60% of buildings were constructed before 1990, with
waterproofing systems that had a design life of 15 to 20 years and which have never been
adequately replaced.

Portugal's 2021 census (INE) established that approximately 1.2 million dwellings presented
moderate or major repair needs. Moisture — in roofs, walls, and foundations — is the most
frequently cited cause. It is a national-scale problem, and its solution is not cosmetic: it
cannot be solved with a coat of waterproofing paint or a one-year workmanship guarantee.

Membriko, based in Pombal at the geographical heart of Portugal, works exclusively with EPDM
rubber membrane because it is the only waterproofing system that responds definitively to this
problem in the Portuguese residential context. It is not a ten-year solution that the homeowner
will need to revisit in the next decade. It is an installation for the full service life of the
property, with 50-plus years of documented performance and a 20-year Membriko installation
warranty. This page explains why — with data, with polymer science, and with the direct
experience of a team that installs EPDM membranes on residential buildings every working day.

## Why Portuguese Homes Develop Waterproofing Failures

Understanding the solution requires first understanding the causes of the problem. In Portugal,
residential waterproofing failure does not happen at random — it follows predictable patterns
that Membriko diagnoses on every technical site visit.

### An Ageing Housing Stock

Portugal has one of the oldest residential building stocks in Western Europe. The median
construction year for buildings in the historic centres of Lisbon and Porto sits in the 1960s.
The vast majority of these buildings used two-ply bituminous felt as their waterproofing system
— a material with a practical service life of 15 to 20 years under Portuguese climate conditions,
subject to accelerated degradation by ultraviolet radiation and thermal cycling. Decades later,
much of that bituminous felt is still in place: cracked, hardened, with seam overlaps open and
upstand flashings lifted. The consequence is what homeowners describe as "infiltrações" — the
ubiquitous Portuguese word for water getting where it should not.

### Palliative Rather Than Systematic Solutions

The typical response to a waterproofing problem in a Portuguese home or apartment has been the
palliative solution: a coat of waterproofing paint over the existing system, a mastic repair at
a visible joint, a layer of liquid bitumen over the roof. These approaches resolve the symptom
for two to four years, after which the problem returns — frequently worse than before, because
the accumulation of incompatible systems on top of each other has made the substrate impossible
to bond to adequately.

Membriko encounters this pattern on almost every technical visit to a property over 20 years
old: three or four systems superimposed on each other, each installed over the failure of the
previous one, none of them performing. The correct diagnosis begins by recognising that the
waterproofing of a residential building is a system — not a collection of isolated details.

### Portugal's Specific Climate Challenges

Portugal imposes exceptionally demanding conditions on waterproofing systems:

- **UV radiation:** Portugal receives 2,500 to 3,000 hours of sunshine annually — roughly
  double the annual hours in countries such as the United Kingdom or Germany, where most
  waterproofing product technical data sheets are developed. Materials with double bonds in
  their polymer backbone (SBS and APP modified bitumens, some PVC formulations without
  adequate stabilisers) degrade significantly faster in southern Portugal than northern
  European data suggests.

- **Thermal cycling:** A flat roof surface in Évora or the Algarve reaches 80 to 85°C in
  July and can drop below 0°C on a January night in inland regions. This annual cycle of
  approximately 80°C amplitude imposes continuous fatigue stress on any material that lacks
  sufficient elasticity to accommodate it without accumulating micro-fractures.

- **Intense concentrated rainfall:** Portuguese precipitation is not distributed uniformly
  across the calendar year. Intense rainfall events in October to November and February to
  March load roofing systems suddenly and severely. Systems that have accumulated slow
  degradation over the summer months reveal their failures in the first autumn storms.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Answer for Residential Buildings

Membriko did not choose EPDM for commercial convenience. The choice is grounded in polymer
chemistry and confirmed by decades of in-service performance data from climates comparable
to Portugal's.

### The Chemistry That Explains Everything

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a rubber elastomer whose primary polymer chain is
composed exclusively of single carbon-to-carbon bonds. This saturated backbone is chemically
inert to ultraviolet radiation and atmospheric ozone — the two primary agents of outdoor polymer
degradation. This resistance is not achieved through protective coatings that deplete over time:
it is intrinsic to the molecular architecture of the material.

Compare this with SBS-modified bitumen: the styrene-butadiene-styrene block contains
carbon-to-carbon double bonds in the main chain — precisely where UV radiation and ozone attack
through photooxidation. This is why modified bitumen becomes brittle, develops transverse
cracking, and loses elongation capacity over 10 to 15 years in Portuguese conditions. EPDM has
no such degradation mechanism.

The carbon black incorporated into EPDM during manufacture (25 to 35 parts per hundred rubber)
acts as a UV absorber, converting photon energy to heat rather than allowing chain scission. The
vulcanisation of EPDM creates a three-dimensional cross-linked network: as a thermoset material,
it cannot be melted, does not permanently deform under heat, and retains its elasticity from
-45°C to +150°C — a service temperature range that no competing residential waterproofing
material matches.

### What the Field Data Shows

Membriko bases its service life claims on two independent studies, not on marketing literature:

**The ERA Study (EPDM Roofing Association, USA):** Five EPDM roofing installations aged between
28 and 32 years in active service were sampled and tested. Every value for tensile strength and
elongation at break exceeded the minimums of ASTM D4637 for aged membranes. Elongation at break
retained: 180 to 240% (minimum for aged EPDM: 100%). No delamination, oxidative cracking, or
plasticiser migration was detected. These were membranes that had been protecting buildings for
three decades and still exceeded specification.

**The SKZ Study (Suddeutsches Kunststoff-Zentrum, Germany):** 39 samples of EPDM membrane from
European installations in real service were tested using Arrhenius methodology. The median
projected service life exceeded 50 years under Central European climate conditions. For
Mediterranean conditions like those of Portugal, field data from the southern United States
(Texas, Arizona — solar irradiance comparable to the Alentejo and Algarve) confirms that EPDM
maintains its performance even under high UV loads.

Membriko declares a service life in excess of 50 years as a technically defensible position
based on this evidence — and supports this declaration with a 20-year installation warranty
delivered in writing to every client at project completion.

## Types of Residential Buildings — EPDM Suits Them All

Portugal has a rich variety of residential building typologies, and Membriko has experience
across all of them. EPDM rubber membrane is not a niche solution — it is the most versatile
waterproofing system available for residential applications in Portugal.

### Single-Family Home (Moradia Unifamiliar)

The single-family home is often the most urgent situation: the owner lives in the property and
feels the direct impact of water ingress. The most common applications in Portuguese homes
include the flat roof above a kitchen or living room extension, the terrace over a garage, the
balcony above habitable space, and foundation waterproofing for homes with basements or
underground rooms.

Membriko can address each of these elements independently or as an integrated system in a
single site mobilisation. A single-storey flat roof of 150 m² can typically be waterproofed
by Membriko in four to six working days, from substrate preparation to completion of the
final leak test.

### Apartment Block and Condominium

The apartment building presents specific challenges: the building roof (cobertura) is a shared
element affecting all top-floor occupants, and its waterproofing requires approval at a
Condominium Assembly (Assembleia de Condóminos) under Article 1427 of the Portuguese Civil
Code. The inter-floor balconies are individual property elements, but their waterproofing
integrity affects the apartment directly below them.

Membriko provides all technical documentation required for presentation at Condominium Assembly:
technical memorandum, scope of works specification, programme, and warranty conditions. Our
experience in condominium projects includes managing work phasing to minimise disruption to
residents and coordinating access with building management.

### Luxury Villa and Holiday Home

Luxury villas and holiday homes present greater roofing complexity: multiple roof planes,
terraces with landscaping, swimming pools integrated into the building volume, rooftop solar
panel arrays. Membriko designs and installs integrated EPDM systems that address all this
complexity as a single watertight envelope, with detail quality appropriate to a high-value
property.

EPDM installed beneath stone, composite timber decking, or an extensive green roof is
completely invisible — the aesthetic of the finished surface is determined by the protective
covering, not by the membrane beneath it. Membriko is certified for installation under all
these finish systems.

### Terraced House and Townhouse

The terraced house presents the specific challenge of the party wall — the boundary between
two properties is frequently the most vulnerable waterproofing detail. Membriko installs party
wall upstand flashings in prefabricated EPDM that guarantee watertightness independently of
whatever waterproofing system exists on the adjacent property, without any dependency on a
neighbour's membrane or maintenance habits.

---

## Whole-House Waterproofing: The Systems Approach

Membriko approaches residential waterproofing as an integrated system, not a collection of
isolated interventions. Field experience consistently demonstrates that water finds alternative
pathways: repairing only the roof while leaving a first-floor balcony without adequate
waterproofing simply defers the problem by one rainy season.

### The Five Waterproofing Planes of a Portuguese Home

**Plane 1 — Roof and Accessible Terrace**
The roof is the primary interception surface for precipitation. Membriko installs EPDM
membranes on flat and low-slope roofs using three methods: the fully adhered system (bonded to
the substrate across its full area with contact adhesive), the mechanically fastened system
(fastener discs at seam overlaps, membrane field loose), or the ballasted system (membrane
loose-laid, held by washed rounded gravel or concrete pavers). The method selection depends on
the structural capacity, roof geometry, and wind exposure of the specific project.

**Plane 2 — Balconies and Pedestrian Terraces**
Accessible terraces with pedestrian traffic require a protection layer over the EPDM membrane:
ceramic tile, natural stone, composite timber decking on adjustable pedestals, or concrete
paving slabs on support pads. Membriko specifies 1.5 mm EPDM as a minimum for pedestrian
terraces, and 2.0 mm for landscaped terraces with soil substrate or higher imposed loads. The
junction between the terrace surface and the window or door threshold is the highest-risk
singular point in residential waterproofing — Membriko prefabricates EPDM threshold flashings
in the workshop to the exact site dimensions before installation.

**Plane 3 — Below-Grade Walls and Foundations**
Basement walls and buried foundation structures of Portuguese homes are frequently waterproofed
only with cementitious render — a solution that does not resist hydrostatic pressure or the
biological attack of soil organisms. Membriko applies EPDM to the positive (external) face of
foundation walls before backfilling, creating a permanent barrier against soil moisture and
groundwater pressure. Root resistance (FLL certification, EN 13948) is especially important
for foundations adjacent to mature garden landscaping.

**Plane 4 — Expansion Joints and Transition Details**
Structural expansion joints are the points where differential movement in the building
concentrates. Membriko uses prefabricated EPDM expansion joint profiles with 300 to 450%
elongation to cross these joints without rigidity — a system that behaves elastically rather
than cracking when the building moves under seasonal thermal loads or under live loading.

**Plane 5 — Penetrations and Singular Points**
Drainage pipes, electrical conduits, antenna masts, solar panel brackets, and roof lights —
each is a penetration through the waterproofing membrane and a potential point of failure.
Membriko does not use bituminous mastic on any new installation: every singular point is
sealed with prefabricated EPDM pipe boots, pressure-ring collars, or workshop-fabricated
flashings made to the exact dimensions of the penetrating element.

---

## Installation with Minimum Disruption to Occupants

One of the primary concerns homeowners express when considering a waterproofing intervention
is disruption to everyday life. Membriko understands this constraint and organises its
installation methodology specifically to minimise it.

EPDM membrane installation by Membriko is cold — no gas torch, no naked flame, no fire risk
near timber-framed extensions, wooden pergolas, or combustible insulation materials. The bonding
adhesive used on Membriko residential projects is water-based: no strong organic solvent odour,
no penetrating smell reaching the floors below through open windows or ventilation systems.
Noise is minimal: no hot-air welding machines, no vibration equipment.

The installation process on a typical single-family home flat roof of 100 to 150 m² takes three
to five working days. Membriko provides a written daily programme to every client before work
begins, so the homeowner knows exactly what is happening on each day and can plan accordingly.

EPDM membranes are manufactured in widths of up to 15 metres and supplied as factory-cut panels
to the exact dimensions of the project. Many residential terraces can be covered with a single
sheet containing no field seam — eliminating the highest-risk zone of any waterproofing system.
Where laps are required, they are sealed with pressure-activated EPDM seam tape: no welding,
no flame, no wait for adhesive to cure before the next panel can be placed.

---

## Renovation of Existing Residential Properties

The renovation of Portugal's existing housing stock is the dominant application context for
Membriko in the residential sector. More than 40,000 dwellings undergo substantive renovation
works annually in Portugal, and the great majority require waterproofing intervention.

### Over-Membrane Versus Full Strip-Out

Membriko evaluates every renovation project individually before recommending an approach:

**Over-membrane installation (re-roofing):** Where the existing substrate is structurally
sound and the surface is stable, Membriko can apply EPDM directly over the existing system
after surface preparation. This eliminates the cost and waste of complete strip-out and reduces
installation time significantly. The approach is compatible with EPDM applied over aged
bituminous felt (after surface consolidation treatment) and over concrete substrates. It is the
preferred solution when the diagnostic survey confirms that no moisture is trapped in the
substrate or insulation layer.

**Full strip-out and renewal:** Where the existing membrane has delaminated, where thermal
or resistive moisture surveys detect trapped moisture in the insulation or substrate, or where
slope correction is required before the new system is applied, Membriko specifies complete
removal. This decision is based on measured data, not commercial preference.

### Simultaneous Thermal Upgrade

The renovation of an existing roof is the optimal moment to improve thermal performance
simultaneously. Membriko installs warm-roof configurations (insulation above the structural
slab, EPDM above the insulation) as an integrated service alongside the waterproofing work:

- 80 mm PIR insulation board: achieves U = 0.28 W/m²K (meets REH requirement of 0.35 W/m²K)
- 100 mm PIR insulation board: achieves U = 0.22 W/m²K (exceeds the requirement by 37%)
- 120 mm PIR insulation board: achieves U = 0.18 W/m²K (approaching passive house standard)

Improving the roof U-value contributes directly to the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)
of the property — mandatory documentation for sale and rental in Portugal under Decreto-Lei
118/2013.

## EPDM Versus Traditional Residential Waterproofing Materials

Homeowners across Portugal are routinely presented with three alternatives before contacting
Membriko: modified bituminous felt, PVC sheet membrane, and liquid-applied polyurethane systems.
The honest comparison is as follows:

### EPDM versus Modified Bitumen Felt (SBS/APP)

Modified bitumen is the dominant waterproofing material in Portuguese residential construction
and has real advantages: low initial installation cost and a wide network of applicators. Its
limitations in the Portuguese residential context are, however, decisive.

The practical service life under Portuguese climate conditions is 10 to 20 years — rarely
reaching the upper end of that range in regions with high UV exposure. Gas-torch application
is a genuine fire risk in residential settings with adjacent timber elements, pergolas, and
wooden decking. Modified bitumen is not compatible with green roof plantings: roots penetrate
it without resistance. And each replacement cycle requires complete removal of the previous
system — a disruptive and costly operation.

Membriko offers the homeowner a single installation for the full life of the property, with
no anticipated replacement cycle.

### EPDM versus PVC Sheet Membrane

Plasticised PVC has an established track record in roofing waterproofing, but presents important
vulnerabilities in the residential context. Plasticisers — typically phthalate or adipate
compounds — migrate out of the PVC matrix over time under the combined effect of heat, UV
radiation, and water. Loss of plasticiser causes progressive stiffening, brittleness, and a
tendency to split and crack, typically manifesting between years 10 and 20 of service in
Portuguese conditions.

PVC is chemically incompatible with the bituminous products commonly used for flashing details
in Portuguese residential construction: interfaces between PVC membranes and bitumen-based
sealants are well-documented failure points. Membriko specifies EPDM because it contains no
plasticisers: its flexibility is intrinsic to the vulcanised elastomer architecture and does
not change over time.

### EPDM versus Liquid-Applied Polyurethane (PU) Systems

Liquid PU systems have a genuine advantage: they are applicable over very complex geometries
without seams. Their limitations in the residential context are significant. The practical
service life is 5 to 10 years, after which reapplication is required — an ongoing maintenance
cost and disruption cycle. The applied thickness is dependent on the applicator, and pinholes
or zones of insufficient thickness are common execution defects with liquid systems. Surface
preparation is critical: residual moisture, contamination, or existing coatings compromise
adhesion. And liquid PU is not suitable for applications where root resistance is required.

| Criterion | EPDM — Membriko | Modified Bitumen | PVC Sheet | Liquid PU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Documented service life | 50+ years | 10-20 years | 15-25 years | 5-10 years |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic | Requires protection | Good (with plasticiser) | Requires recoating |
| Flame-free installation | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Periodic maintenance required | None | Annual recommended | Annual recommended | Recoating 5-10 years |
| Root resistance | Yes (EN 13948) | No | No | Not recommended |
| Membriko warranty | 20 years | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Energy Efficiency and Thermal Comfort in the Home

The Membriko EPDM membrane is not merely a water barrier — it is the completion of the thermal
envelope at roof level. Installing a warm-roof system with EPDM over PIR or EPS insulation
simultaneously improves waterproofing and the energy performance of the property.

Portugal's Regulation on the Energy Performance of Residential Buildings (REH, Decreto-Lei
118/2013) establishes maximum U-values for the envelope elements of renovated residential
buildings: 0.35 W/m²K for the roof. An existing uninsulated concrete slab has a U-value of
approximately 2.0 to 3.0 W/m²K — five to ten times worse than the REH requirement. Membriko's
standard warm-roof configurations achieve U = 0.18 to 0.22 W/m²K with 100 to 120 mm of PIR
insulation, exceeding the regulatory requirement by more than 37%.

For top-floor apartments without air conditioning, reducing the summer thermal load by improving
the roof U-value translates to peak indoor temperatures 3 to 5°C lower in July and August — a
tangible comfort benefit that residents experience directly, without any mechanical equipment.

Membriko offers an optional cool-roof coating in white acrylic compatible with EPDM, which
reflects 75 to 85% of incident solar radiation and reduces the rooftop surface temperature by
20 to 30°C on summer peak days. This option is particularly relevant for apartment blocks where
top-floor residents have no independent control over a cooling system. The cool-roof coating
does not void the Membriko installation warranty and can be applied at any point during the
membrane's service life.

Membriko also designs and installs extensive green roof systems over EPDM as an integrated
residential service: planted roofs provide 30 to 40% additional reduction in thermal flux through
the roof assembly compared with a bare membrane surface, reduce stormwater runoff, and create
usable garden space above the waterproofed structure. EPDM is the root-resistant base membrane
for all Membriko green roof systems (FLL root resistance certification, EN 13948) — no
additional root barrier layer is required.

## "Construir Portugal" — The 6% VAT Benefit for Homeowners

Portugal offers a significant fiscal advantage to homeowners who renovate residential properties:
the reduced 6% VAT rate on construction works on residential buildings, under Lista II-Verba 2.27
of the Código do IVA.

This reduced rate applies to works of conservation, maintenance, repair, and renovation on
buildings designated primarily for residential use, carried out by registered contractors. It
expressly covers waterproofing works on roofs, terraces, balconies, and foundations. The 6%
rate instead of the standard 23% rate represents a saving of 13.8 percentage points on the total
project value.

On a residential waterproofing project of €15,000, the difference amounts to €2,070 saved in
VAT alone. On a €40,000 project combining waterproofing and thermal insulation, the saving
reaches €5,520.

Membriko is a fully registered construction company with IMPIC (the Institute of Public Markets,
Real Estate, and Construction) and issues invoices at the 6% VAT rate for all qualifying
residential renovation projects. We provide clients with the technical documentation needed to
support IRS deductions where applicable, and we can coordinate with certified energy auditors
to maximise the resulting Energy Performance Certificate classification.

The energy performance improvement achievable by combining waterproofing with roof insulation
may also qualify the property for preferential "green mortgage" financing terms offered by
several Portuguese lenders (Caixa Geral de Depósitos, BPI, Millennium BCP) for properties
with EPC class A or B. Membriko is familiar with these programmes and can guide clients through
the documentation requirements.

## Technical Specifications for Residential Applications

Membriko specifies the highest-quality EPDM membranes available in the European market,
selected on the basis of independent technical documentation and third-party certification.
All products comply with EN 13956 (flexible sheets for waterproofing — synthetic polymer
sheets) and carry CE marking as required for the Portuguese market.

| Property | Value | Test Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard residential) | 1.2 mm / 1.5 mm / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
| Service temperature range | -45°C to +150°C | — |

Membriko does not specify product by price. We specify on documented performance — and we
back that specification with the longest installation warranty available in the Portuguese
residential waterproofing market.

## Maintenance for Residential Property Owners

One of the most common questions Membriko receives from homeowners is: "What maintenance will
I need to do after the installation?" The answer is straightforward.

EPDM does not require periodic painting, re-sealing, UV treatment, or any surface product
throughout its service life. Membriko seam joints are sealed with pressure-activated EPDM
seam tape at installation — they do not require periodic re-sealing if correctly installed
under the quality protocols Membriko applies on every project.

**What Membriko recommends (not mandatory, but prudent):**

An annual visual inspection in October — after the summer thermal stress period and before
the winter rainy season — is the most valuable single maintenance action a homeowner can
take. Check that roof drain outlets are clear of leaf debris; confirm that parapet upstand
flashings are lying flat and intact; look for any physical damage from items dropped on the
roof surface.

After severe storms, check for sharp metallic debris on the roof surface. EPDM withstands
hail impact without damage, but sharp-edged metal fragments (antenna components, roofing
accessories blown from neighbouring buildings) can puncture the membrane if left in place
under wind pressure.

Biological growth — algae or moss on shaded sections of the membrane — is normal, harmless
to EPDM, and can be removed with low-pressure washing (maximum 150 bar) or a dilute bleach
solution compatible with the membrane if aesthetics require it.

**Membriko Annual Maintenance Contract:**
Available as a standalone contract or bundled with the installation programme, covering an
annual site visit and full inspection, drain clearing and flow verification, minor repair work
up to 1 m² per visit included, and a written inspection report for ITE compliance and insurance
documentation purposes.

---

## Regulatory Framework and Property Value Protection

Residential waterproofing in Portugal is governed by a body of regulation that Membriko
understands and complies with in full on every project.

**RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas, Decree-Law 38 382/1951):** Article 90
requires a minimum drainage slope of 1% for flat roofs and terraces on residential buildings.
Membriko designs to a 2% minimum slope as engineering best practice, to compensate for
construction tolerances and ensure positive drainage even after structural settlement.

**REH (Decreto-Lei 118/2013):** The Regulation on the Energy Performance of Residential
Buildings defines maximum U-values for the building envelope elements of renovated dwellings.
Membriko's warm-roof systems consistently exceed the regulatory requirements, contributing to
improved Energy Performance Certificate classifications.

**EN 13956:** The harmonised European product standard for flexible sheets for waterproofing.
Membriko specifies only CE-marked membranes conforming to this standard — no product is
specified without documented third-party testing against EN 13956 requirements.

**Portuguese Civil Code, Article 1225:** The statutory five-year liability period for
construction defects provides the legal baseline for contractor responsibility. Membriko's
20-year installation warranty extends this protection by 15 years — four times the statutory
minimum — providing residential clients with coverage that lasts long into the property's
next ownership cycle.

**Property value impact:** Properties with documented Membriko EPDM waterproofing and an
active warranty are consistently valued more favourably by independent surveyors. The absence
of moisture risk eliminates the discount that prospective buyers negotiate when moisture
evidence is found during survey. An improved EPC class — achievable when waterproofing and
insulation upgrade are combined — directly affects achievable rental yields in Portuguese urban
markets where EPC class is a mandatory disclosure in all sale and rental listings.

Several Portuguese home insurers, including Fidelidade, Allianz Portugal, and Generali, accept
Membriko's warranty certificate as documentation supporting reduced premium rating for
properties with verified EPDM waterproofing. Clients receive this certificate at handover and
are advised to retain it with their property title documents.

## Frequently Asked Questions — Residential EPDM Waterproofing

**1. Can I waterproof my balcony without removing the existing tiles?**

This depends on the condition of the tiles and the substrate beneath them. Where tiles are
solidly adhered and the screed underneath is structurally sound and dry, Membriko can prepare
the surface and apply EPDM over the existing system. Where hollow-sounding tiles are detected
by tapping, where moisture surveys identify wet screed, or where active cracking is present,
Membriko recommends full strip-out before EPDM is applied. The diagnostic site visit determines
the correct approach for each specific situation.

**2. My building is over 50 years old. Is the structure suitable for a new waterproofing system?**

EPDM has the significant advantage of being exceptionally lightweight: 1.4 to 1.7 kg/m² at
1.2 mm thickness, imposing negligible structural load in adhered or mechanically fastened
configurations. Where a ballasted system is under consideration, Membriko carries out a
structural load assessment before specifying this method. Older buildings with reinforced
concrete or stone masonry structures are frequently excellent candidates for adhered EPDM:
the membrane's extraordinary elongation (300 to 450%) accommodates the differential movements
accumulated over decades of service far better than any rigid system.

**3. What is the approximate cost of waterproofing a typical house terrace?**

Membriko does not publish price schedules because every project is unique: substrate condition,
access constraints, the number and complexity of singular points (penetrations, drains, parapet
upstands), and the inclusion of simultaneous thermal insulation all affect the total significantly.
As a market reference, residential terrace waterproofing projects in Portugal typically range
from €60 to €120 per square metre installed depending on specification. A free on-site quotation
from Membriko, issued after a technical site visit, is the most reliable starting point.

**4. Can EPDM support the weight of plants and soil in a rooftop garden?**

Yes. EPDM is the standard base membrane for extensive and intensive green roof systems
worldwide. It is resistant to soil chemistry, biological attack from soil bacteria and fungi,
and root penetration (FLL certification, EN 13948). The critical consideration is not the
membrane but the load-bearing capacity of the structure: extensive green roofs (10 to 15 cm
substrate depth) add approximately 120 to 150 kg/m² to the roof slab; intensive green roofs
(30 cm or more of substrate) add 300 to 500 kg/m² or more. A structural engineer must verify
the slab capacity before committing to this configuration.

**5. What is the impact of EPDM waterproofing on my energy performance certificate?**

The EPDM membrane itself has negligible thermal resistance. However, when installed as part
of a warm-roof system over thermal insulation — which is Membriko's standard practice for
renovation projects — the combined system dramatically improves the U-value of the roof
element. An existing uninsulated concrete slab (U ≈ 2.0 to 3.0 W/m²K) upgraded to a 100 mm
PIR warm-roof system (U ≈ 0.22 W/m²K) represents a substantial improvement in Energy
Performance Certificate terms — potentially contributing to an improvement of one or two EPC
classes, with a direct impact on market value and rental yield.

**6. Does the 6% VAT rate apply to waterproofing work on a rented apartment?**

The reduced 6% VAT rate (Lista II-Verba 2.27, Código do IVA) applies to works of conservation,
maintenance, repair, and renovation on residential buildings regardless of whether they are
owner-occupied or rented, provided the building is at least two years old and the works are
carried out by a licensed contractor. Works on a shared building element (such as the building
roof) managed by the condominium committee also qualify under the same conditions, provided
the building meets the age requirement and Membriko is engaged as the registered contractor.

**7. How long will installation take on a typical family home?**

A single-family home with a flat roof of 100 to 150 m² typically takes three to five working
days from substrate preparation to completion, including the flood test and drain installation.
More complex projects — multiple roof planes, simultaneous insulation installation, high
numbers of singular points — may require seven to ten working days. Membriko provides a
written day-by-day programme with every project quotation, so homeowners can plan access and
make domestic arrangements with certainty.

**8. What happens if a leak appears during the warranty period?**

Membriko's 20-year warranty covers defects in materials and installation workmanship. If
moisture ingress occurs during the warranty period, Membriko will carry out a site investigation,
identify the cause, and undertake repair at no cost to the client if the defect falls within
the warranty scope. The warranty is delivered as a formal written certificate at project
handover. Clients are strongly advised to retain this certificate with their property title
documents — it has demonstrable legal and commercial value in any future sale or remortgage
of the property.
