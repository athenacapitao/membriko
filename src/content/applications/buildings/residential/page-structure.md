# Residential Buildings — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The residential buildings page serves homeowners, condominium managers, property developers, and
architects working on private dwellings across Portugal. Unlike technical commercial or industrial
pages, this page must operate on two simultaneous registers: emotional resonance with homeowners
who feel the anxiety of a failing roof or damp-stained ceiling, and technical credibility for
architects and surveyors specifying a waterproofing system.

The persuasion arc is designed accordingly:
1. Open with the emotional reality of residential moisture failure — the damp ceiling, the stained
   wall, the devalued property
2. Establish that most residential waterproofing failures in Portugal are systemic, not accidental
3. Introduce EPDM as the engineering answer, supported by data
4. Cover the full range of residential building types, confirming relevance to the reader's context
5. Present the whole-house waterproofing concept — framing Membriko as a systems partner, not
   just a flat-roof contractor
6. Address installation comfort and disruption minimisation — a critical concern for occupied homes
7. Cover renovation specifically — the dominant use case in the Portuguese residential market
8. Compare EPDM with the materials homeowners have already been sold: bituminous felt, PVC sheets,
   liquid coatings
9. Quantify the energy savings and comfort benefits — directly linked to REH compliance
10. Explain the "Construir Portugal" 6% VAT benefit — a decision accelerator unique to residential
11. Provide technical specifications in a homeowner-accessible format
12. Cover ongoing maintenance obligations (minimal) — reduce post-sale anxiety
13. Explain the regulatory framework (RGEU, REH, ITE) and property value protection
14. FAQ section targeting homeowner search queries

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Establish emotional stakes immediately. Homeowners with waterproofing problems feel
vulnerable — the page must demonstrate immediate empathy and then introduce the durable solution.

**Content:**
- Headline: "A Sua Casa Merece uma Impermeabilização para Toda a Vida" / "Your Home Deserves
  Waterproofing for Life"
- Sub-headline: 40% of all residential building defects in Portugal involve moisture intrusion;
  EPDM eliminates the problem with documented 50+ year performance
- Four stat blocks: 50+ years vida útil / Garantia 20 anos Membriko / 6% IVA em reabilitação /
  -45°C a +150°C temperatura de serviço
- CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico Gratuito" (primary) + "Ver Casos de Aplicação" (secondary)
- Background: photograph of a clean, recently waterproofed residential terrace or a before/after
  image of a Portuguese residential building

**Design note:** This hero should feel residential, not industrial. Warmer photography.
Use three stat blocks and the 6% VAT reference as an added context element.

## Section 2: The Problem — Why Portuguese Homes Leak

**Purpose:** Show deep understanding of the homeowner's specific pain. Establish that the
problem is not isolated but structural and predictable.

**Content:**
Three root causes specific to Portuguese residential construction:

1. **Parque habitacional envelhecido (Ageing Housing Stock)**
   - 62% of Portuguese dwellings predate 1990; the original waterproofing systems (bituminous
     felt in most cases) had a design life of 15-20 years and have not been replaced
   - Moisture damage is currently estimated in over 1.2 million dwellings nationally (INE, 2021)

2. **Soluções de baixo custo mal executadas (Low-Cost Solutions Poorly Applied)**
   - Two layers of bituminous felt applied by inadequately trained operatives dominated
     residential waterproofing until the 2000s; seams and singular points were rarely sealed
     to standard; system failures begin within 5-8 years under Portuguese UV load
   - Liquid coatings (tintas impermeabilizantes) were sold as DIY solutions; applied too
     thin, they fail at substrate cracks and at junctions within 3-5 years

3. **A cobertura como detalhe em vez de sistema (Treating the Roof as a Detail, Not a System)**
   - Renovation projects frequently address visible water entry points without diagnosing
     the actual system failure; band-aid repairs over failed membranes delay the inevitable
     by 1-3 years at most; the original failure propagates

**Visual:** Three-panel illustration showing moisture pathways — from roof through structure
to interior ceiling. Before/after photography of residential damage versus completed EPDM
installation.

## Section 3: Por Que o EPDM é a Resposta Certa para Habitação

**Purpose:** Transition from problem to solution. Technical credibility balanced with
homeowner-accessible language.

**Content:**

**Química que não falha (Chemistry That Does Not Fail)**
- EPDM's saturated carbon-carbon backbone: chemically inert to UV and ozone — this is
  the same UV exposure that bleaches deck furniture and cracks garden hoses, and EPDM
  does not respond to it
- No plasticisers: PVC sheet liners and some bituminous systems rely on additives that
  migrate out over time, causing brittleness. EPDM's flexibility is intrinsic — nothing
  migrates, nothing depletes
- 300-450% elongation: accommodates the thermal movement of a residential roof without
  accumulating stress at seams, junctions, or penetrations

**Instalação a frio, sem chama (Cold Installation — No Open Flame)**
- All EPDM bonding and seaming at Membriko is done with pressure-sensitive or
  water-activated adhesives and seam tape — no gas torch in the residential environment
- Critical safety advantage for installations near timber-frame extensions, pergolas,
  wooden decking, or combustible insulation

**Uma membrana que dura mais que a hipoteca (A Membrane That Outlasts the Mortgage)**
- 50+ year documented service life (ERA 30-year field study; SKZ German durability study)
- Membriko 20-year installation warranty certificate delivered to every client
- Portuguese Civil Code Article 1225 statutory 5-year defect liability: Membriko's
  warranty exceeds this by 15 years

## Section 4: Tipos de Edifícios Residenciais — Todos Têm Solução

**Purpose:** Confirm relevance to the reader's specific building type. Reduce any doubt that
EPDM applies to their particular situation.

**Content:** Four building type cards, each with specific applications and key benefit.

1. **Moradia Unifamiliar (Single-Family Home)**
   - Applications: flat roof above kitchen or living room extension; terrace over garage;
     ground-floor flat roof; balcony above crawlspace; foundation below garden level
   - Key consideration: installation can be phased; Membriko can address individual elements
     or the complete roof and terrace envelope in a single mobilisation
   - Typical project duration: 3-7 days for a complete single-storey flat roof

2. **Apartamento e Condomínio (Apartment and Condominium)**
   - Applications: building cobertura (roof affecting all top-floor units); inter-floor
     balconies; parking deck podiums; communal terraces
   - Key consideration: condominium waterproofing is a shared cost under Código Civil
     (Regime de Propriedade Horizontal); Membriko provides documentation suitable for
     condómino assembly approval and APEMIP compliance
   - Approvals note: communal element works require Assembleia de Condóminos approval (Art.
     1427 Código Civil — qualified majority)

3. **Moradia de Luxo e Villa (Luxury Villa and Holiday Home)**
   - Applications: complex multi-level roofing systems; pool surrounds and pool terraces;
     landscaped roof terraces above garages and basements; rooftop solar integration
   - Key consideration: premium aesthetic expectations require fully concealed membrane
     systems (protected under stone, tile, decking or planted substrates)
   - EPDM is the compatible base membrane for all these finish types

4. **Moradia em Banda / Townhouse (Terraced House)**
   - Applications: party wall junctions (critical waterproofing risk zone), small flat
     roof above rear kitchen extension, communal roof drainage
   - Key consideration: party wall junctions require careful detail to avoid moisture
     transfer between properties; Membriko's prefabricated upstand flashings address
     this specifically

**Visual:** Four illustrated or photographic cards. Map of Portugal indicating
Membriko's coverage from base in Pombal.

---

## Section 5: Impermeabilização Integral da Habitação

**Purpose:** Introduce the whole-house waterproofing concept. Elevate Membriko from a
single-element installer to a residential waterproofing partner.

**Content:**

**The five waterproofing planes of a Portuguese home:**

1. **Cobertura / Terraço (Roof / Terrace)**
   - Primary interception layer for precipitation
   - EPDM system: fully adhered, mechanically fastened, or ballasted according to roof
     type and structural capacity
   - Upstand height: minimum 200 mm at all parapet junctions (Membriko standard; RGEU
     minimum 150 mm)
   - Drainage: sumped outlets at calculated spacing; no positive slope required for EPDM
     but RGEU minimum 1% slope maintained as design standard

2. **Varanda e Terraço Habitável (Balcony and Accessible Terrace)**
   - Pedestrian traffic above EPDM requires a protection layer: ceramic tile, stone,
     composite decking, or concrete pavers on support pads
   - Membriko specifies 1.5 mm EPDM minimum for pedestrian terraces; 2.0 mm for
     landscaped terraces with soil substrate
   - Junction detail between terrace and window/door threshold is the highest-risk
     singular point; Membriko pre-fabricates EPDM threshold flashings to site dimensions

3. **Paredes Abaixo do Nível do Solo / Fundações (Below-Grade Walls / Foundations)**
   - EPDM is chemically resistant to soil bacteria, humic acids, and groundwater — the
     primary biological and chemical agents attacking below-grade membranes
   - Applied to the positive (external) face of the foundation wall before backfilling,
     EPDM provides permanent waterproofing for basement rooms and underground garages
   - Root resistance (EN 13948 FLL certification) is critical where garden landscaping
     is adjacent to the foundation

4. **Balcões e Juntas de Dilatação (Balconies and Expansion Joints)**
   - Expansion joint bridging: EPDM's 300-450% elongation accommodates thermal and seismic
     movement across joints without the rigid bridge systems used for other materials
   - Prefabricated EPDM expansion joint profiles available in widths up to 100 mm

5. **Penetrações e Pontos Singulares (Penetrations and Singular Points)**
   - The most common residential waterproofing failure is at penetrations: drainpipes,
     electrical conduits, antenna masts, solar panel brackets
   - Membriko installs prefabricated EPDM pipe boots, pressure-ring seals, and
     proprietary bracket flashings — no exposed mastic on any new installation

**Visual:** Cross-section diagram of a residential building showing all five waterproofing
planes highlighted in EPDM coloration. Each plane labelled with the EPDM solution.

## Section 6: Instalação com Mínima Perturbação

**Purpose:** Address the homeowner's anxiety about disruption during installation.
Particularly important for occupied buildings.

**Content:**

**Why EPDM Minimises Residential Disruption:**

- **Cold installation:** no gas torch, no combustion equipment, no fire watch requirement.
  Work can proceed immediately adjacent to occupied spaces, wooden elements, and
  landscaping without a safety exclusion zone
- **No strong solvent odour during installation:** Membriko uses water-based EPDM bonding
  adhesives as standard on residential projects, eliminating the solvent odour that
  plagues conventional adhesive-bonded systems
- **Single visit for large areas:** EPDM sheets manufactured up to 15 m wide and supplied
  in factory-cut panels mean many residential terraces can be covered in a single
  installation day with minimal waste
- **No drying or curing wait between layers:** EPDM does not require the overnight curing
  periods that liquid systems need between coats; the installation timeline is predictable
- **Clean installation:** EPDM offcuts are contained and removed; there is no torch smoke,
  no melted bitumen, no solvent residue to clean from adjacent surfaces

**Membriko's residential installation programme:**
- Day 1: substrate preparation, existing system removal if required
- Day 2-3: EPDM membrane installation, singular point fabrication
- Day 4 (if required): flood test or electronic verification, snagging list
- Day 5: protection layer installation (tiles, decking, pavers)

**Visual:** Clean, calm photography of EPDM installation in progress on a residential roof.

## Section 7: Reabilitação de Habitações Existentes

**Purpose:** Address the renovation use case — the dominant application in the Portuguese
residential market. Speak directly to homeowners dealing with existing failed systems.

**Content:**

**Portugal's Renovation Challenge:**
Over 1 million Portuguese dwellings have waterproofing systems that have exceeded their design
life. The visible symptoms — damp stains on ceilings, efflorescence on exterior walls,
mould growth in corners, peeling paint at soffits — are not cosmetic problems. They are evidence
of active water ingress into the structural elements and thermal insulation of the building.

**Over-membrane versus strip-out installation:**
Membriko evaluates each renovation case individually:
- **Over-membrane (re-roofing):** where the existing substrate is structurally sound and
  the surface is stable, EPDM can be bonded directly over the existing system after
  surface preparation. This eliminates the cost and waste of full strip-out and reduces
  installation time significantly. Compatible with EPDM over aged bituminous felt (after
  surface consolidation treatment) and over concrete substrates.
- **Strip-out and renew:** where the existing membrane has delaminated, where trapped
  moisture in the substrate is confirmed (by thermal or moisture meter survey), or where
  slope correction is required, full strip-out is specified. Membriko's diagnostic survey
  determines which approach is appropriate before any proposal is issued.

**Simultaneous thermal upgrade:**
RGEU Article 90 renovation of an existing roof is the optimal moment to upgrade thermal
performance. Membriko can install a warm-roof configuration (membrane above insulation)
simultaneously with the waterproofing work:
- 80 mm PIR insulation: achieves U = 0.28 W/m²K (exceeds REH requirement of 0.35 W/m²K)
- 100 mm PIR insulation: achieves U = 0.22 W/m²K (significantly exceeds REH requirement)
- 120 mm PIR insulation: achieves U = 0.18 W/m²K (near-passive-house standard)

**6% VAT on renovation works:**
Waterproofing and thermal insulation work on existing residential buildings (at least 2 years
old) qualifies for the 6% reduced VAT rate under Lista II-Verba 2.27 do Código do IVA —
provided the works are executed by a licensed contractor. Membriko is fully licensed and
provides the invoice format required to document the VAT rate applicable.

## Section 8: EPDM vs Materiais Tradicionais Residenciais

**Purpose:** Pre-empt the "but I was quoted a bitumen system" objection. Frame objectively.

**Content:** Comparison table focused on residential-relevant criteria.

| Critério | EPDM | Feltro Betuminoso | Folha PVC | Líquido PU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vida útil documentada | 50+ anos | 10-20 anos | 15-25 anos | 5-10 anos |
| Resistência UV | Intrínseca — sem degradação | Requer acabamento | Boa (com plastificante) | Requer recoating |
| Instalação em habitação ocupada | Sim — sem chama | Risco de chama | Sim — soldadura a ar quente | Sim — odor |
| Manutenção periódica | Não requerida | Inspecção anual recomendada | Inspecção anual | Recoating 5-10 anos |
| Compatibilidade com verde | Sim — EN 13948 | Não (degradado por raízes) | Não | Não recomendado |
| IVA a 6% em reabilitação | Sim | Sim | Sim | Sim |
| Garantia Membriko | 20 anos | N/A | N/A | N/A |

Below the table: honest paragraph acknowledging that bituminous systems and liquid membranes
have lower initial costs on simpler applications, and that this comparison is about lifecycle
value rather than purchase price. The homeowner who intends to stay in the property for more
than 15 years will almost always save money with EPDM.

**Visual:** Colour-coded comparison table. EPDM column highlighted. Lifecycle cost bar chart
(illustrative, indexed values — not absolute pricing).

## Section 9: Eficiência Energética e Conforto Térmico

**Purpose:** Link waterproofing to energy performance — a topic of active consumer interest
in Portugal given energy prices and REH requirements.

**Content:**

**EPDM as part of the thermal envelope:**
- A correctly specified EPDM warm-roof system is not just a waterproofing system — it is
  the completion of the thermal envelope at roof level
- Portuguese REH U-value requirements for roofs in residential renovation: 0.35 W/m²K
  maximum (Zona Climática I1-I3 for heating; V1-V3 for cooling)
- Membriko's standard residential warm-roof configuration: 1.2 mm EPDM + 100 mm PIR
  achieves U = 0.22 W/m²K — 37% better than the regulatory minimum

**Cool-roof option:**
- Standard black EPDM absorbs approximately 93% of incident solar radiation, which warms
  the roof but does not degrade the membrane
- White or light-grey acrylic cool-roof coating (compatible with EPDM) applied over black
  EPDM reflects 75-85% of solar radiation, reducing rooftop surface temperature by 20-30°C
  in summer
- For top-floor apartments without air conditioning, a cool-roof coating can meaningfully
  reduce peak indoor temperatures during July-August heatwaves
- Cool-roof coatings compatible with EPDM are available from Membriko as an optional
  add-on and do not void the installation warranty

**Green roof option:**
- Planted green roofs above residential spaces provide superior thermal insulation (30-40%
  additional reduction in heat flux through the roof), reduce rainwater runoff, and create
  usable garden space
- EPDM is the standard root-resistant membrane base for all green roof systems (FLL test,
  EN 13948); no additional root barrier is required with correctly specified EPDM
- Membriko designs green roof systems for residential buildings as an integrated service

## Section 10: "Construir Portugal" — Benefícios Fiscais para Proprietários

**Purpose:** Make the financial case using actual Portuguese tax incentives.
This section is a significant decision accelerator for residential clients.

**Content:**

**6% VAT on Renovation Works:**
- Under Lista II-Verba 2.27 do Código do IVA, works of conservation, maintenance, repair
  and renovation on buildings designated primarily for residential use attract VAT at 6%
  rather than the standard 23%
- Applies to: waterproofing of roofs, terraces, foundations, balconies, and all elements
  of the residential building envelope
- Conditions: building must be at least 2 years old; contractor must be a registered
  construction company (Membriko is fully registered with IMPIC)
- The 13.8 percentage-point VAT reduction on the total project value is significant for
  projects in the €5,000-€50,000 range typical of residential waterproofing renovation

**IRS Deduction for Energy Efficiency (IRS Jovem / Deduções Habitação):**
- Works that improve the energy performance certificate class of a primary residence may
  qualify for IRS deduction under the Orçamento do Estado categories for "eficiência
  energética e reabilitação"
- Simultaneous waterproofing and thermal insulation upgrade frequently improves the EPC
  class of the property
- Membriko provides the technical documentation required to support IRS deductions where
  applicable (energy performance calculation by certified technician can be commissioned
  through Membriko's network of energy auditors)

**Property Finance:**
- Portuguese mortgage lenders (Caixa Geral de Depósitos, BPI, Millennium BCP among others)
  have introduced "Green Mortgage" products offering preferential rates for properties with
  Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) class A or B
- A combined waterproofing and insulation upgrade that lifts a property from EPC class D
  to EPC class B can unlock these preferential rates for refinancing

**Visual:** Icon-based infographic on the three financial benefits. Sample calculation
showing VAT saving on a typical €15,000 residential project (€2,070 VAT saving at 6% vs
23% rates).

## Section 11: Especificações Técnicas para Proprietários

**Purpose:** Provide technical confidence without overwhelming homeowners with data.
Architects and specifiers will review this; homeowners need the accessible version.

**Content:** Two-level presentation — homeowner summary + technical detail table.

**Homeowner summary:**
- Thickness: 1.2 mm for standard roofs and terraces; 1.5-2.0 mm for accessed areas
- Colour: black (standard), anthracite, or with light-reflective top coating
- Width: up to 15 metres — most residential terraces can be covered without a seam in
  the middle of the field (the weakest part of any waterproofing system)
- Cold installation: no flames, no solvents, no strong odours
- Warranty: 20 years from Membriko; 50+ year documented service life

**Technical specification table:**

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard residential) | 1.2 mm / 1.5 mm / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | — |
| Reaction to fire | Class E | EN 13501-1 |
| Water absorption | < 1% by weight | ASTM D471 |
| Root resistance | FLL certified | EN 13948 |
| Product standard | EN 13956 Type 3 | — |
| Warranty (Membriko) | 20 years | — |

## Section 12: Manutenção para Proprietários

**Purpose:** Reduce post-sale anxiety. Most homeowners fear they are buying a product
that will require ongoing expensive maintenance.

**Content:**

**What Maintenance EPDM Does NOT Require:**
- No periodic painting or coating
- No annual sealing of seams or junctions (correctly installed Membriko seams are
  factory-tape bonded and do not require periodic resealing)
- No treatment against UV (intrinsic resistance; no sacrificial topcoat)
- No specialist inspection equipment (visual inspection by the homeowner is sufficient
  as an annual check)

**What We Recommend (not mandatory):**
- Annual visual inspection (October recommended — after summer thermal stress, before
  winter rainy season): check drain outlets are clear; verify no physical damage; confirm
  upstand flashings are intact
- After severe storms: check for any wind-blown debris that may have caused
  punctures; EPDM can sustain hail without damage, but sharp metal debris (antenna
  components, roofing accessories from adjacent buildings) can puncture
- Biological growth: algae or moss on shaded sections of the membrane is normal and
  harmless; remove with low-pressure washing or a dilute bleach solution if aesthetics
  require

**If Damage Occurs:**
- Membriko's warranty covers manufacturing and installation defects; physical damage
  from external causes is repaired under our maintenance service agreement
- Emergency temporary repair (if damage occurs between service visits): EPDM self-
  adhesive patch tape is available from Membriko for homeowner emergency use; this does
  not replace a professional repair but contains active water ingress pending inspection

**Membriko Annual Maintenance Service:**
Available as a standalone contract or bundled with the installation warranty, including:
- Annual site visit and full inspection
- Drain clearing and flow verification
- Minor repair work included up to 1 m² per visit
- Written inspection report for ITE compliance and insurance documentation

**Visual:** Simple checklist graphic for annual homeowner inspection. Contact CTA.

## Section 13: Regulamentação e Proteção do Valor do Imóvel

**Purpose:** Reassure homeowners that EPDM meets all Portuguese regulatory requirements
and that the investment protects property value.

**Content:**

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- RGEU Article 90: 1% minimum slope — Membriko designs to 2% as standard
- REH: thermal performance — EPDM warm-roof exceeds the required U-value significantly
- EN 13956: the European product standard; CE-marked EPDM is mandatory for market access
  in Portugal; Membriko specifies only CE-marked, EN 13956 compliant membranes
- ITE: the periodic mandatory inspection system for residential buildings. A property
  with documented EPDM waterproofing and a current Membriko warranty is in the strongest
  possible position for ITE compliance

**Property Value:**
- Documented waterproofing upgrade with Membriko's written warranty increases
  the attractiveness of the property to buyers and reduces the sale discount that
  buyers negotiate when they identify moisture risk
- Improved Energy Performance Certificate (when combined with simultaneous insulation
  upgrade) is mandatory documentation for property sale and rental in Portugal
- Insurance: several Portuguese home insurance providers (Fidelidade, Allianz Portugal,
  Generali) offer reduced premiums for properties with documented EPDM waterproofing;
  Membriko's warranty certificate is accepted as documentation

**Visual:** Regulatory compliance badge grid. Property value chart (illustrative).

## Section 14: FAQ

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail residential search queries and reduce pre-sale question volume.

Eight questions focused on homeowner concerns:

1. **Posso impermeabilizar a minha varanda sem retirar os azulejos?**
   Depends on the condition of the existing tiles and substrate. If the tiles are firmly
   adhered and the screed beneath is sound, Membriko can apply EPDM over the existing
   surface after preparation. If tiles are hollow (ponimento), cracked, or if moisture
   surveys detect wet screed, strip-out is recommended before EPDM installation. The
   diagnostic visit determines which approach is correct.

2. **O meu prédio tem mais de 50 anos. O EPDM é adequado para estruturas antigas?**
   Yes. EPDM's extreme flexibility (300-450% elongation) makes it particularly well-suited
   to older concrete structures that have undergone significant settlement and thermal
   movement over decades. The membrane accommodates irregularities and cracks in the
   substrate that would cause rigid systems to fail. A structural assessment of the roof
   slab is recommended before installation on buildings over 40 years old.

3. **Qual é o custo indicativo de impermeabilizar o terraço de uma moradia?**
   Membriko does not publish price lists as every project is unique — substrate condition,
   access, singular points (penetrations, drains, upstands) and the presence or absence
   of simultaneous thermal insulation work all affect the total. Residential terrace
   projects in Portugal typically range from €60-€120 per m² installed, depending on
   specification. A free on-site quotation from Membriko is the most reliable starting
   point.

4. **O EPDM aguenta o peso das plantas e da terra de um jardim de cobertura?**
   Yes. EPDM is the membrane of choice for extensive and intensive green roofs. The
   membrane itself is unaffected by soil chemistry, root pressure (EN 13948 root resistance
   certification) or moisture. The structural consideration is the soil weight: extensive
   green roofs (10-15 cm substrate) add approximately 120-150 kg/m²; intensive green
   roofs (30+ cm substrate) add 300-500+ kg/m². The building structure must be verified
   by a structural engineer before proceeding.

5. **Qual é o impacto da impermeabilização EPDM no meu certificado energético?**
   EPDM itself is a waterproofing layer with negligible thermal resistance. However, when
   installed as part of a warm-roof system over thermal insulation (standard Membriko
   practice for renovation works), the combined system significantly improves the U-value
   of the roof element. A roof upgraded from an uninsulated concrete slab (U ≈ 2.0-3.0
   W/m²K) to a 100 mm PIR warm-roof system (U ≈ 0.22 W/m²K) represents a major improvement
   in the energy performance certificate.

6. **O IVA a 6% aplica-se à impermeabilização de um apartamento arrendado?**
   The 6% VAT rate under Lista II-Verba 2.27 applies to works on residential buildings
   regardless of whether they are owner-occupied or rented, provided the building is at
   least 2 years old and the works qualify as conservation, maintenance, repair or
   renovation. Works on a communal element (such as the building roof) managed by the
   condominium committee also qualify under the same conditions.

7. **Quanto tempo dura a instalação da impermeabilização EPDM numa casa típica?**
   A standard single-family home flat roof of 100-150 m² typically takes 3-5 working days
   from substrate preparation to completion, including flood test and drain installation.
   Larger or more complex projects (multiple levels, simultaneous insulation, complex
   singular points) may take 7-10 working days. Membriko provides a written programme with
   every quotation so the homeowner can plan accordingly.

8. **O que acontece se aparecer uma infiltração durante o período de garantia?**
   Membriko's 20-year warranty covers defects in materials and installation workmanship.
   If moisture ingress occurs within the warranty period, Membriko will conduct a site
   investigation, identify the cause, and carry out repair at no cost to the client if
   the defect falls within the warranty scope. The warranty is provided in writing as a
   formal certificate at handover. Clients are encouraged to maintain their copy with
   the property title documents.
