# Commercial Buildings — EPDM Research Summary

## The Commercial Waterproofing Context

Commercial buildings in Portugal represent a distinct and demanding category for waterproofing
specification. Unlike residential construction, commercial projects must satisfy a convergence of
requirements: building regulations, energy certification obligations, fire safety codes, green
building rating criteria, insurance policy conditions, and the operational continuity requirements
of tenants and building managers. A waterproofing failure in an office block or shopping centre is
not merely a maintenance issue — it is a business disruption event with measurable financial
consequences for multiple parties simultaneously.

The Portuguese commercial real estate sector comprises an estimated 47 million square metres of
gross leasable area as of 2024, with significant stock concentrated in the Greater Lisbon and
Porto metropolitan areas, along the A1 corridor (where Pombal is centrally located), and in
coastal tourism centres. A substantial proportion of this stock was built between 1970 and 2000
using SBS and APP modified bitumen waterproofing systems that have reached or exceeded their
design life. Refurbishment of commercial roofing represents the dominant workload category in the
sector today.

## Commercial Building Types and Their Waterproofing Challenges

### Office Buildings (Edifícios de Escritórios)

Modern office buildings in Portugal typically feature extensive flat roof areas carrying HVAC
plant, condensing units, communications antennae, cable management systems, and in newer
installations, photovoltaic arrays. The penetration density on a commercial office roof —
sometimes exceeding 15 to 20 penetrations per 100 m² — creates a disproportionate concentration
of waterproofing risk at singular points relative to a clear residential roof. Each conduit, pipe,
drain, and equipment base is a potential failure point. The waterproofing membrane must also
accommodate differential movement between the structural slab and equipment support frames
anchored to it.

Office buildings with suspended ceilings conceal water damage from roof failures for extended
periods. By the time visible staining appears at ceiling level, the infiltration path has typically
been active for months, and internal insulation, cable runs, and ceiling void services may have
been damaged beyond the cost of waterproofing alone.

### Retail and Shopping Centres (Centros Comerciais e Retalho)

Shopping centres present unique challenges: large clear-span roofs covering areas that may reach
tens of thousands of square metres, operated continuously throughout the year with high sensitivity
to any service interruption. The standard of waterproofing installed during construction of major
Portuguese shopping centres in the 1990s and 2000s — largely SBS modified bitumen in two-layer
torch-applied systems — is now approaching end of life, with failures reported at parapet
junctions, drainage sumps, and expansion joints in multiple major properties.

The critical constraint in retail refurbishment is that installation must proceed with the centre
remaining open and operational. Roof access, staging of materials, and the elimination of torch
work (fire risk in occupied retail environments) are all specified requirements that favour EPDM's
cold-applied installation methodology.

### Hotels (Hotéis)

The hospitality sector adds reputation and guest experience to the financial consequences of
waterproofing failure. A roof leak in a hotel room generates an immediate service failure,
reputational damage via review platforms, and often a room-night credit — all in addition to the
repair cost. Hotels in Portugal's coastal tourism belt face the combination of high UV exposure
and Atlantic storm events that produces the most aggressive weathering conditions in the country.

Hotel roofs often carry additional complexity: accessible terraces, spa areas, swimming pools on
podium structures, and green roofs that must perform as amenity spaces while maintaining
watertightness. EPDM's root resistance (tested to EN 13948 and FLL) and its compatibility with
the structural loading of amenity surfaces make it the material of choice for these compound
assemblies.

### Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities (Hospitais e Unidades de Saúde)

Healthcare facilities impose the most demanding specification requirements in the commercial
sector. The consequences of waterproofing failure — contaminated sterile environments, damaged
medical equipment, compromised patient safety — create an imperative for waterproofing systems
with the longest achievable service life and the most robust warranty backing. EPDM manufacturers
offer extended warranties of up to 40 years on systems installed in critical infrastructure.

Hospitals also present complex roof assemblies: extensive mechanical plant rooms, medical gas
installations, roof-mounted emergency generators, helipads, and radiological protection layers in
certain specialist facilities. All penetrations must be made watertight without compromise to the
primary membrane.

## Regulatory Framework for Commercial Buildings in Portugal

### Energy Certification (RECS — Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Comércio
e Serviços)

Decree-Law 118/2013 and its successive revisions establish the energy certification framework for
commercial and service buildings in Portugal. The thermal performance of the roof envelope —
expressed as U-value in W/m²K — directly affects the building's energy class rating. The maximum
permitted U-value for roofs in commercial buildings varies by climate zone under the Portuguese
climate classification (NUTS II thermal zones I1, I2, I3 for heating and V1, V2, V3 for cooling):

- Zone I1/V1 (mild): Uroof ≤ 0.50 W/m²K
- Zone I2/V2 (moderate): Uroof ≤ 0.40 W/m²K
- Zone I3/V3 (severe): Uroof ≤ 0.35 W/m²K

A 1.5 mm EPDM membrane installed over 100 mm PIR insulation (lambda 0.022 W/m²K) achieves
U-values in the range of 0.20 to 0.22 W/m²K — meeting all zone requirements with significant
margin. The RECS also considers cool roof effects: reflective white EPDM topcoat systems that
achieve solar reflectance index (SRI) above 0.65 can contribute to reduced cooling energy demand
credits in building energy simulations.

### Fire Safety — SCIE (Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios)

Decree-Law 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008 establish the framework for fire safety in buildings
(SCIE). Commercial buildings fall into multiple utilisation categories under the SCIE classification:

- Type III (Administrative) — office buildings above a defined height threshold require fire
  reaction class documentation for all roof covering materials
- Type VIII (Commercial or Service) — shopping centres and large retail require BROOF(t4) external
  fire performance classification for the roof covering in specific risk scenarios

EPDM vulcanised rubber membranes achieve reaction to fire class E under EN 13501-1 — a combustible
material that does not sustain flame once the ignition source is removed. Where BROOF(t4) is
required, a mineral ballast layer (minimum 50 mm rounded gravel, 50 kg/m²) or a fire protection
board overlay is specified over the EPDM membrane. This is a standard detail that EPDM systems
handle without compromise to the membrane itself.

### Accessibility of Rooftops — DL 163/2006 (Acessibilidade)

Where rooftops serve as amenity terraces or access routes in commercial buildings, accessibility
provisions apply to ramp gradients, surface texture, and edge protection. EPDM over a concrete
protection screed or pedestrian paver system satisfies the structural and surface performance
requirements while maintaining complete membrane continuity beneath.

## Green Building Certification

### BREEAM-Portugal

BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), administered through
BREEAM-NOR for the Portuguese market, awards credits in the Materials category that directly
benefit EPDM specifications:

- **Mat 01** (Life Cycle Assessment): EPDM membranes from manufacturers publishing Environmental
  Product Declarations (EPDs) to EN 15804 contribute to the Life Cycle Assessment credit. Leading
  European EPDM manufacturers including Elevate (formerly Firestone) and Carlisle SynTec publish
  third-party verified EPDs.
- **Mat 03** (Responsible Sourcing): EPDM from manufacturers with environmental management
  certification (ISO 14001) contributes to the responsible sourcing credit.
- **Wat 02** (Water Calculation): Cool roof and green roof assemblies over EPDM contribute to
  storm water management credits.
- **Ene 01** (Energy Performance): Improved U-values from well-insulated EPDM roofs directly
  support the energy performance credit.

### LEED v4 (BD+C)

LEED certification in Portugal, though less common than BREEAM, is increasingly specified for
multinational corporate office buildings and logistics facilities. The LEED Materials and Resources
credit MR-C4 (Recycled Content) and MR-C5 (Regional Materials) are achievable with EPDM
depending on supply chain documentation. The Sustainable Sites credit SS-C7 (Heat Island Effect
— Roof) rewards roofs achieving SRI ≥ 78 for high-sloped roof assemblies or ≥ 29 for low-slope,
or green roof assemblies over minimum 50% of the conditioned roof area.

## Technical Performance Data for Commercial Applications

### Wind Uplift Engineering

Commercial buildings are subject to more stringent wind uplift calculations than residential
construction, particularly for buildings above 10 m height in exposed wind zones. EN 1991-1-4
(Eurocode 1, Part 1-4: Wind Actions) specifies wind pressure coefficients for roof zones — the
perimeter and corner zones of large commercial roofs experience uplift forces of 1.5 to 2.5 kN/m²
in Portuguese Atlantic coast locations with moderate exposure. Mechanically fastened EPDM systems
can be engineered to resist these loads through pull-out tested fastener patterns with verified
substrate capacity. Fully adhered systems eliminate the concern through continuous membrane-to-
substrate bonding, achieving uplift resistance values exceeding 4 kN/m² when properly executed.

### Rooftop Equipment Integration

HVAC plant on commercial buildings creates specific detailing requirements. Units mounted on
raised curbs require:
- Continuous EPDM membrane wrap up and over the curb face with a minimum 150 mm upstand
- Water-tight junction with the unit base using a prefabricated EPDM pressure plate and clamping
  ring where the membrane passes through the support frame
- Provisions for thermal movement between the fixed equipment base and the building structure
  using EPDM expansion joint strips

Condenser unit vibration can transmit to the roof structure, creating micro-movement at membrane
seams adjacent to the equipment. EPDM's inherent elasticity and the use of flexible-connection
details at equipment curbs are standard Membriko practice for commercial installations.

### Thermal Bridging in Commercial Assemblies

Large commercial buildings commonly use inverted roof assemblies (extruded polystyrene insulation
above the waterproofing membrane) or warm roof assemblies (insulation below the membrane on a
vapour-controlled deck). Both configurations avoid the condensation risk of a cold roof assembly
in a heated building, but each requires specific design attention:

Inverted roof: The membrane must resist the hydrostatic load of the drainage course above and the
cyclic freeze-thaw of entrapped moisture. EPDM is the preferred membrane for inverted assemblies
due to its dimensional stability under load and its imperviousness to water absorption.

Warm roof: Vapour control layer continuity is critical. All fasteners, pipe sleeves, and
penetrations through the VCL must be sealed with compatible tape or liquid vapour barrier, as any
breach creates a condensation pathway through the insulation to the membrane.

## EPDM vs Competing Systems in Commercial Specification

The commercial sector is where the true total cost of ownership (TCO) case for EPDM is strongest,
because the cost of disruption from waterproofing failure is multiplied by the scale of occupied
floor area affected.

### EPDM vs TPO in Large Commercial Roofing

TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin) is commonly specified in commercial projects due to competitive
initial pricing and the availability of light-coloured membranes for cool-roof credits. However:
- Field seam heat-welding reliability depends on operator skill and ambient conditions
- Long-term UV performance of TPO seam adhesive at the weld flash has been questioned in peer
  review literature
- Reported service life in European commercial applications averages 12 to 18 years before
  significant maintenance is required — approximately half the documented EPDM service life

### EPDM vs PVC in Retail Applications

PVC membranes have a long European track record in commercial roofing, particularly in Northern
Europe. Their plasticiser migration problem, however, is now well-documented in Portuguese
applications where higher temperatures accelerate the migration rate. PVC membranes installed in
the 1990s on Portuguese commercial properties frequently show surface crazing, shrinkage (causing
tensile stress at upstands), and brittleness within 15 to 20 years. Replacement costs are
comparable to initial installation due to the labour-intensive removal requirement.

### EPDM vs Liquid Applied Membranes

Liquid-applied systems (polyurethane, PMMA, cementitious) are frequently specified for complex
geometries and small-area rooftop detail work. On large commercial roof fields, however, their
limitations include: consistent film thickness control across thousands of square metres, recoating
obligations every 5 to 10 years, sensitivity to rain interruption during application, and higher
long-term maintenance cost than EPDM sheet systems. EPDM is the appropriate primary membrane
for large commercial roof fields; liquid systems remain useful for complex flashings and transition
details where they are used in conjunction with the EPDM primary system.

## Maintenance and Inspection Programs for Commercial Properties

Commercial property managers and facilities management companies require structured maintenance
programs with documented inspection records for insurance compliance and asset management
reporting. The standard Membriko commercial maintenance protocol includes:

- Annual visual inspection: drainage clearance, upstand condition, equipment base integrity
- Five-year infrared thermography survey: detection of sub-membrane moisture without invasive
  probing
- Condition report with photographic record: issued in PDF format with GPS-referenced photograph
  annotations
- Defect classification: colour-coded categorisation of identified defects by severity and
  recommended action timeline
- 20-year installation warranty: covers material defects and workmanship failures, documented
  in the property's maintenance record system

This structured approach to asset documentation is increasingly required by commercial property
investors and institutional owners for their asset management platforms, and is a standard
Membriko deliverable on all commercial projects.
