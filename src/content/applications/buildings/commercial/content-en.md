# Commercial Building Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## An Asset Decision, Not a Maintenance Decision

When a waterproofing membrane fails on a commercial building, the consequences extend far beyond the cost of repair. A roof failure in an occupied office block, shopping centre, hotel, or hospital is a business disruption event with measurable financial consequences distributed across multiple parties simultaneously: the building owner absorbing repair costs and liability exposure, the tenants suffering operational disruption and damage to their contents, the asset manager recording an unplanned capital expenditure, and the insurer responding to the claim. The true cost of a failing commercial roof is systematically underestimated when the analysis stops at the membrane replacement price.

Membriko was established on a straightforward conviction: that commercial waterproofing with EPDM rubber membrane is the only technically correct choice for building owners and managers who think in 20, 30, or 50-year horizons — not in annual maintenance budgets. Membriko is an EPDM specialist based in Pombal, at the geographical centre of Portugal, and works exclusively with EPDM rubber membrane. This is not a general waterproofing contractor that also installs EPDM when a client requests it. Every Membriko technician, every logistics process, every quality control procedure is built around a single material and a single method.

The Portuguese commercial property market is navigating an inevitable rehabilitation cycle. Decades of construction using SBS and APP modified bitumen systems are reaching end of service life simultaneously, across the country. The question facing building owners and asset managers is not whether their commercial roof will require intervention — it is when, and with what system. This page answers that question with technical rigour, documented performance data, and the accumulated experience Membriko brings to office complexes, retail centres, hotels, and healthcare facilities across Portugal.

## The Portuguese Commercial Property Sector and the Waterproofing Challenge

Portugal's commercial real estate sector encompasses an estimated 47 million square metres of gross leasable area, with significant stock concentrated in Greater Lisbon, the Porto metropolitan area, and along the A1 motorway corridor — the spine of the country through which Membriko is centrally positioned at Pombal. A substantial proportion of this stock was constructed between the 1970s and 2000s using modified bitumen waterproofing systems that have now reached or exceeded their design service life.

Commercial roof rehabilitation is currently the highest-volume segment in the Portuguese waterproofing market. This reality creates two distinct categories of building owners: those who manage the problem reactively — patching leaks as they emerge, repeatedly, until the accumulated cost of repairs exceeds the cost of replacement — and those who adopt a lifecycle approach, replacing the failed system with a solution that carries a 50-year proven service life, eliminating the roof problem for the next two or three tenancy cycles without intervention.

Membriko works with the second category. The Membriko commercial client base includes property developers, institutional investment funds with Portuguese asset exposure, business park operators, hotel groups, and regional health authorities. What these organisations share is that they evaluate waterproofing as an asset decision — with total lifecycle cost analysis, implications for the building's energy certificate, and documentation requirements for their asset management systems.

### The Four Components of the True Cost of Commercial Waterproofing Failure

When a commercial roof fails, the cost rarely stops at the membrane repair. Complete analysis includes:

**1. Direct damage to interior installations.** Suspended ceilings, insulation, electrical installations in roof-level conduit runs, IT infrastructure in data rooms and server suites, and the contents of spaces below the infiltration zone. In office buildings with critical technical infrastructure, the content damage cost can be an order of magnitude larger than the cost of the roof repair itself.

**2. Rent abatement and tenant compensation.** Portuguese law — the Código Civil and the Regime do Arrendamento Urbano — establishes the landlord's obligation to maintain the property in habitable and usable condition. A failing roof that impairs the use of a commercial space can generate rights to rent reduction, suspension, or termination, as well as compensation for damage to the tenant's business or property.

**3. Management and claims handling costs.** Technical assessment of the loss, stakeholder communications, insurer negotiations, emergency contractor management, legal documentation — all of these activities consume management time with a real opportunity cost.

**4. Impact on asset valuation.** A building with documented water infiltration history, or with a roof in poor condition, suffers a discount in property valuation. Institutional investors acquiring assets in Portugal conduct detailed technical due diligence — and a roof at end of service life with a failure history is a direct price-reduction factor or a retention condition pending rectification.

Membriko consistently frames the commercial waterproofing proposal within this context of asset value: the cost of not intervening, or of intervening with the wrong system, is systematically higher than the cost of a correctly executed EPDM solution.

## Building Types: Sector-Specific Expertise

Membriko does not apply a generic approach across all commercial buildings. Each typology presents specific technical and operational challenges that require distinct solutions and processes.

### Office Buildings

Modern office buildings in Portugal present rooftop surfaces with penetration density far exceeding residential construction. Air handling units, condensers, extract and supply ductwork, cable management conduits, telecommunications antennae — each element is a penetration through the waterproofing membrane and, therefore, a singular point of failure risk. A typical commercial office building of 3,000 m² gross floor area may have 30 to 60 roof penetrations, each one requiring a factory-detailed waterproofing transition rather than a site-formed mastic fill.

A specific risk in office buildings is the concealment of water ingress damage by suspended ceiling systems. In a building with a suspended ceiling at 2.5 metres and a roof structure at 12 metres above floor level, infiltration can travel through slabs, insulation, and ceiling void services for months before becoming visible. Membriko includes, as a standard process component, electronic leak detection of the full installed surface — not only visual inspection of seams — specifically to eliminate defects that would remain undetected until they have already caused hidden damage.

### Shopping Centres and Retail

Shopping centres represent the extreme case in terms of operational constraints. With roof areas that may reach tens of thousands of square metres, continuous operation 365 days per year, and extreme sensitivity to any service interruption, installing new waterproofing on an operating retail centre requires planning that extends well beyond membrane selection.

Membriko has a specific protocol for installation in occupied retail environments:

- **Phased working zones of 300 to 500 m²**, with each zone made watertight before the next is opened. The building maintains roof coverage across its full extent at all times.
- **Cold installation — no open flame.** This is the single most important reason commercial retail managers specify EPDM. The absence of open flame eliminates the hot-work permit procedure and the associated fire risk. The security management team does not need to activate fire watch procedures for roofing works — the process is entirely cold.
- **No VOC fumes at occupant level.** Water-based and low-VOC EPDM adhesive systems eliminate the solvent odour that causes tenant complaints and which can represent a health concern in spaces with limited ventilation.
- **Overnight continuity.** At the end of each working day, any incomplete section is sealed with temporary protection. No roof area is left exposed to overnight weather risk.

### Hotels and Tourism Accommodation

The hospitality sector adds the guest experience dimension to the already complex financial consequences of waterproofing failure. A roof leak in a hotel room generates an immediate service failure, reputational damage on review platforms, and typically a room-night credit — in addition to the repair cost. In Portugal, where tourism is a primary economic driver and where quality hotel supply competes in a demanding European market, the reliability of waterproofing has a direct impact on business sustainability.

Hotels also present the complexity of accessible roof surfaces — pool terraces, spa areas, garden rooftops — that must function as amenity spaces while maintaining complete watertightness below. Membriko specifies EPDM systems with root resistance tested to EN 13948 and FLL for planted roof assemblies, and floating slab or technical decking protection systems for accessible terraces, always maintaining the continuity of the waterproofing membrane beneath any overlay or loading.

### Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities

Healthcare facilities occupy the top of the criticality hierarchy: they are the buildings that can least tolerate any waterproofing failure. Contamination of a sterile environment — an operating theatre, ICU, hospital pharmacy, or clinical laboratory — by water infiltration carries clinical and regulatory consequences that render the cost of roof repair irrelevant by comparison. Membriko approaches healthcare specifications with the level of rigour that matches the criticality of the application.

For healthcare projects, Membriko specifies systems carrying manufacturer warranties of up to 40 years — the longest available in the single-ply membrane market — combined with Membriko's own 20-year installation warranty. The documentation package includes full technical specification, installation photographic records, electronic leak detection test certificates, and warranty certificates formatted for integration into the hospital facilities management system.

## Why EPDM Is the Correct Membrane for Commercial Buildings

The choice of membrane for a commercial building should not be driven by installation cost per square metre. It should be driven by total lifecycle cost, operational reliability across that lifecycle, and the residual risk of failure in a critical-use building. By these criteria, EPDM has no equivalent.

### Service Life That Eliminates the Replacement Cycle

The SBS and APP modified bitumen systems installed in the Portuguese commercial building stock of the 1980s through 2000s have a real service life of 15 to 25 years in the Portuguese climate, with the lower end of that range being the more common outcome in high UV-exposure locations. A 5,000 m² commercial bitumen roof requiring full replacement represents a substantial capital expenditure — plus the disruption associated with installation in an occupied building.

EPDM, with documented service life exceeding 50 years under European climatic conditions comparable to Portugal, eliminates this cycle within the foreseeable life of the commercial asset. A commercial building constructed or refurbished today with a Membriko EPDM installation will not require new waterproofing before 2075 or beyond — spanning three to four complete tenancy cycles without any roofing reinvestment.

### Cold Application Compatible with Occupied Buildings

EPDM is installed cold — by adhesive bonding, mechanical fastening, or ballasting — without open flame, hot bitumen, combustion gases, or solvent fumes at working level. This characteristic, which is a consequence of the material's chemistry rather than a process choice, has substantial practical implications in occupied commercial environments:

- No fire risk during installation: no hot-work permit required
- No tar or hot bitumen odour requiring tenant notification
- No requirement to clear adjacent spaces for safety reasons during application
- No fumes capable of activating automatic fire detection systems

Membriko regularly works on roofs of occupied buildings where the tenants cannot — and should not — interrupt operations to permit roofing works. EPDM is the only high-performance waterproofing system that satisfies this requirement without any compromise to the quality of the outcome.

### Permanent Elasticity for Large Commercial Structures

Large commercial buildings experience structural movements of significant magnitude: thermal expansion of the reinforced concrete frame and steel elements, concrete creep over time, differential deflection between columns and long-span slabs, and the opening and closing of expansion joints that may represent tens of millimetres of movement. A waterproofing system without adequate elasticity accumulates stress at these points until failure — inevitably.

EPDM's elongation at break — 300% to 500% in current production membranes, substantially above the EN 13956 minimum of 300% — means the membrane absorbs all foreseeable structural movements without concentrating stress at any point. Membriko engineers expansion joint details in roofing to accommodate calculated movements per Eurocode 1 (EN 1991-1-4), with EPDM expansion strips that allow ±50 mm of movement per joint without any stress transfer to the adjacent membrane field.

### Compatibility with All Rooftop Equipment and Services

The chemical inertness of EPDM makes it compatible with all structural and services materials used in commercial roofing: concrete, galvanised steel, aluminium, copper, PVC, polyethylene, and HDPE. There is no galvanic reaction, no chemical leaching, no requirement for separation or protection layers between the membrane and equipment support bases. This universal compatibility simplifies specification and eliminates a family of pathologies common in alternative systems where the membrane reacts with adjacent materials over time.

## Warranty and Building Lifecycle

The warranty associated with a waterproofing system is, for a sophisticated commercial buyer, as important as the technical specification of the membrane. Membriko structures its warranty offer in three levels:

**Membriko Installation Warranty — 20 Years:** Issued by Membriko for all commercial projects, covering workmanship and material defects for 20 years from the date of installation completion. The warranty certificate is registered, nominative to the building owner, and transferable on property sale. The certificate is delivered with the full technical installation dossier.

**Manufacturer Warranty — Up to 40 Years:** For critical infrastructure projects — hospitals, data centres, major logistics hubs — Membriko specifies systems from manufacturers offering material and workmanship warranties of up to 40 years, conditional on installation by a certified applicator. Membriko holds manufacturer certification from the leading European EPDM membrane producers to issue these extended warranty programmes.

**Statutory Defect Liability — 5 Years:** Portuguese law (Código Civil, Article 1225) establishes a minimum five-year contractor liability for construction defects. Membriko's 20-year warranty extends and supplements this statutory obligation without replacing it. Clients receive documentation that clearly explains both layers of protection.

The integration of warranty into asset lifecycle planning is an argument Membriko uses regularly with institutional investors: a building carrying a documented EPDM roofing warranty with 20 years remaining requires a substantially lower capital expenditure provision than a building with a bitumen roof approaching end of service life — and this difference is reflected in transaction pricing and property valuation.

---

## Installation Without Business Disruption

The question Membriko hears most frequently from commercial building managers is whether works can proceed without closing the building. The answer is always yes — and the reason is technical, not merely logistical.

EPDM is installed cold, without open flame, hot gases, hot bitumen, or solvent odours at floor level. The adhesive systems Membriko uses are water-based or low-VOC formulations, which means there is no solvent odour at occupant level in the building below. The absence of flame eliminates the hot-work permit procedure and the requirement for a fire watch. None of the conditioning factors that make other systems incompatible with occupied buildings applies to EPDM installation.

The Membriko protocol for installation in occupied commercial buildings includes:

**Pre-installation planning with building management:** Access survey, identification of sensitive zones (server rooms, laboratories, critical spaces below the working area), definition of working hours compatible with building use, and a phased programme approved by management before mobilisation.

**Protection of facades and external installations:** All rooftop equipment not being directly worked on is protected against dust and preparation debris. Facades below working areas are protected by nets or sheeting.

**Continuous communication with the building manager:** Daily progress reports, advance notification of any activity likely to generate noise above agreed levels (mechanical fastener drilling, for example), and a dedicated Membriko site contact available during working hours.

**End-of-day watertightness guaranteed:** No roofing area is left open or unprotected at the end of the working day. The work sequence is planned to ensure every zone is made watertight before end of day, or sealed with certified temporary protection.

## Rooftop Equipment Integration: HVAC, Antennae, and Building Services Infrastructure

A commercial building roof is not a clean surface. It is a technical platform carrying dozens of penetrations, support frames, service connections, and structural transitions, each of which is a potential infiltration point if not detailed and executed to the correct standard.

Membriko has completed hundreds of commercial roof installations and maintains a catalogue of construction details for every type of standard singular point. There is no improvisation on site — every singular point has a tested, documented detail.

**HVAC condensers and air handling units:** Each unit support is enclosed by EPDM membrane carried up and over the support curb to a minimum height of 200 mm above finished roof level. A prefabricated EPDM curb cap fits over the support frame and is secured with a stainless steel pressure ring. The junction between the EPDM cap and the metal frame incorporates compressed butyl tape to accommodate differential thermal movement without stressing the membrane.

**Drainage outlets:** Drains are installed with EPDM-compatible or cast iron flanges that accept the membrane in a continuous wrap. The membrane passes under the clamping plate, ensuring watertightness by compression. There is no exposed mastic on any drainage fitting in any Membriko installation.

**Service conduits and pipework:** Every pipe penetration receives a prefabricated EPDM pipe boot in the correct diameter, bonded to the primary membrane with a 100 mm overlap and secured to the pipe with a stainless steel jubilee clamp over a butyl tape bed. Membriko does not use polyurethane or silicone mastic at pipe penetrations — mastic dries and cracks within 3 to 7 years in exterior exposure.

**Lightning conductors and earth bonding:** The conductor passes through the membrane via an EPDM saddle piece with a grommetted sleeve, bonded to the membrane and sealed to the conductor with self-amalgamating butyl tape. Earth bonding continuity is maintained without interruption through the detail.

**Structural expansion joints:** Membriko installs EPDM expansion cover strips over all structural expansion joints, bonded to both sides of the joint with a free central expansion loop accommodating ±50 mm of movement in each direction. Strips are tested to EN 1928 for watertightness under hydrostatic head before completion of each project.

## EPDM vs Competing Systems in Commercial Specification

The comparison of waterproofing systems in a commercial context must be based on total lifecycle cost, not installation cost per square metre. Membriko makes this case with data — and the outcome is consistent across every analytical scenario.

| Feature | EPDM | TPO | PVC | Bitumen SBS/APP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Documented service life | 50+ years | 12-18 years | 20-30 years | 15-25 years |
| Installation method | Cold bond — no flame | Hot air weld | Hot air weld | Gas torch — open flame |
| Compatible with occupied buildings | Yes — no flame, low VOC | Partial — weld fumes | Partial — weld fumes | No — open fire risk |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic to polymer chemistry | Good; seam UV risk | Good with plasticiser | Requires protective surface layer |
| Plasticiser migration | None — no plasticisers | None | Yes — progressive stiffening | N/A |
| Root resistance (EN 13948) | Yes | Formulation-dependent | Formulation-dependent | With copper foil additive |
| EPD availability for BREEAM/LEED | Yes (major manufacturers) | Yes (some) | Yes (some) | Limited |
| End-of-life recyclability | 100% thermally recyclable | Yes | Complex — chlorine content | Limited |
| 30-year TCO vs EPDM | Lowest | 15-25% higher | 20-30% higher | 40-50% higher |

**Narrative context on alternative systems:**

TPO is a legitimate choice for budget-driven commercial projects with a planned refurbishment cycle within 12 to 15 years. Its cool-roof reflectivity in light colours has genuine value in cooling-dominated climates, and Membriko acknowledges these advantages honestly. For institutional owners seeking to maximise asset value over a 25 to 30-year hold period, however, TPO does not match EPDM's lifecycle economics in any scenario Membriko has modelled.

PVC has a 30-year European track record in commercial roofing, predominantly in Northern European markets where temperatures are lower. In Portugal's higher-temperature climate, plasticiser migration rates are significantly elevated, compressing effective service life and bringing forward the replacement obligation. PVC membranes installed on Portuguese commercial properties in the 1990s frequently show surface crazing, shrinkage at upstands, and brittleness within 15 to 20 years.

Modified bitumen systems (SBS/APP) should be understood as legacy technology for new commercial specifications. Their continued market share in Portugal reflects familiar specification habits rather than technical merit. The torch application fire risk, the surface protection requirement, and the 15-year replacement cycle are all commercially inferior to EPDM in any lifecycle analysis that accounts for disruption cost.

## Energy Certification Benefits: EPDM as a Rating Improvement Tool

Energy certification for commercial and service buildings in Portugal is governed by the Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Comércio e Serviços (RECS), under Decree-Law 118/2013 and its subsequent revisions. The energy class of a commercial building has direct implications for its property valuation, eligibility for green finance instruments, and competitiveness for corporate tenants with ESG commitments.

The roof contributes to the energy class through the thermal transmittance coefficient (U-value) of the roof assembly. RECS establishes maximum U-values for roofs in commercial buildings according to climatic zone:

- Zone I1/V1 (mild — most of Portugal's Atlantic coast): Maximum Uroof of 0.50 W/m²K
- Zone I2/V2 (moderate — interior and north): Maximum Uroof of 0.40 W/m²K
- Zone I3/V3 (severe — high-altitude interior): Maximum Uroof of 0.35 W/m²K

An EPDM membrane at 1.5 mm installed over 100 mm of PIR insulation (lambda 0.022 W/m²K) achieves U-values in the range of 0.20 to 0.22 W/m²K — meeting all climate zones with substantial margin. In commercial buildings constructed before 1990, where original insulation may be degraded or entirely absent, the installation of a new EPDM membrane with correctly specified PIR insulation can improve the roof U-value from 0.80 W/m²K or worse to 0.21 W/m²K — a fourfold improvement that directly raises the building's energy class in the RECS simulation.

**Cool Roof Option:** Light-coloured EPDM topcoat systems achieve Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) values of 65 to 85. For commercial buildings in Portugal's V3 cooling zone — the Alentejo interior and the Algarve — cool roof specification can reduce cooling energy demand by 8 to 15%, with a corresponding improvement in annual energy performance. Membriko includes U-value calculations in every commercial rehabilitation proposal, and provides the energy auditor with the system data required to update the building's energy certificate.

## Fire Safety in Commercial Buildings

The Portuguese fire safety framework for buildings — SCIE (Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios) — is established by Decree-Law 220/2008 and developed in Portaria 1532/2008. A building's classification under utilisation type (Utilização-Tipo) determines the fire performance requirements applicable to roofing materials.

The three most relevant utilisation types for commercial waterproofing specification are:

**UT III — Administrative** (offices, public administration, and similar): Roofing materials must satisfy minimum reaction to fire Class E under EN 13501-1. Vulcanised EPDM membrane directly satisfies this requirement — Class E indicates a material that does not propagate flame once the ignition source is removed.

**UT VIII — Commercial or Service** (shopping centres, hypermarkets, restaurants, and similar): Larger establishments may require BROOF(t4) external fire performance classification for roof coverings in certain risk scenarios — notably in proximity to property boundaries or in covered arcade configurations. Where BROOF(t4) is required, Membriko specifies a mineral protection overlay above the EPDM membrane: 50 mm of rounded gravel at a minimum of 50 kg/m², or a fire-rated mineral protection board. This is a standard construction detail in Membriko's commercial specification toolkit.

**UT XII — Healthcare** (hospitals, clinics, continuing care facilities): Specific external fire performance requirements for waterproofing membranes do not exceed UT III requirements, but fire compartmentation and escape route clarity on accessible rooftops must be maintained.

**The Practical Advantage of Cold Installation for Fire Safety Compliance:**

An important but frequently underappreciated point: EPDM's cold installation method means that no hot-work permit is required at any stage of the installation process. In occupied commercial buildings operating a Permit to Work system, eliminating the hot-work category of activity from the scope of roofing works significantly simplifies the FM interface and removes the requirement for a fire watch during and for a defined period after application. For large commercial projects where hot-work permit management creates significant administrative overhead and scheduling constraints, this is a material operational benefit.

## Maintenance Programmes for Commercial Properties

Institutional property managers require structured maintenance programmes with defined scope, documented periodicity, and reports that can be integrated into their asset management platforms. Membriko offers three tiers of maintenance programme for commercial properties:

**Tier 1 — Essential (Annual)**

Annual visual inspection by a Membriko technician. Drainage clearance verification — all outlets flowing freely. Upstand condition check — height, bonding, and mechanical fixing integrity. Inspection report: PDF with photographic evidence, defect log, and prioritised recommendations. Scope: all buildings under Membriko installation warranty.

**Tier 2 — Enhanced (Annual with Five-Year Thermographic Survey)**

All Tier 1 scope, plus infrared thermographic survey at years 5, 10, and 15 post-installation — by drone or handheld equipment depending on roof access conditions. The thermographic survey identifies wet insulation and sub-membrane moisture accumulation before any visible infiltration symptom appears at ceiling level. Thermographic report with annotated heat map and quantified wet area estimates. Recommended for buildings where tenant disruption from any future repair event is commercially significant.

**Tier 3 — Comprehensive (Annual, Five-Year Thermography, and Emergency Response)**

All Tier 2 scope, plus emergency call-out response within 4 working hours for active infiltration events. Minor repair works included in the annual contract (up to 2 linear metres of seam repair or 0.5 m² of field repair per year, without additional charge). Priority scheduling: Tier 3 clients receive scheduling priority over non-contract reactive work. Recommended for hospitals, data centres, hotels, and critical commercial infrastructure where any infiltration event has immediate operational consequences.

All maintenance visits generate a report issued electronically within 5 working days. Reports are structured to match the data fields required by standard property management platforms. On request, Membriko provides a structured data export compatible with the client's existing facilities management software.

## The Portuguese Commercial Property Market and Membriko's Positioning

Portugal is navigating a sustained cycle of commercial real estate investment and rehabilitation that is creating structural demand for long-life waterproofing systems. Institutional investors — property investment funds, REITs, pension funds with Portuguese commercial real estate exposure — have adopted technical evaluation practices that clearly discriminate between buildings with remaining waterproofing service life and buildings with imminent replacement obligations.

Membriko occupies a unique position in this market: the only specialist focused exclusively on EPDM with national project delivery capability and a centralised base on the A1 corridor. This specialisation has concrete implications for commercial clients:

**Rapid Mobilisation:** Based in Pombal, Membriko is within 90 minutes' drive of both major commercial property concentrations in the country — Lisbon and Porto. This central position enables team mobilisation to any location in mainland Portugal within a single working day.

**Bilingual Documentation:** For multinational clients managing Portuguese assets from headquarters in other European countries, Membriko issues all technical documentation — specifications, installation reports, warranty certificates — in both Portuguese and English. This capability is directly relevant to German, British, French, and Dutch fund managers with exposure to the Portuguese commercial property market.

**Technical Consistency:** Membriko does not subcontract labour. All installations are executed by Membriko's own crews, trained and certified by Membriko. This policy ensures that the technical standard and quality control process are identical across every project — regardless of scale or location.

**No Tiered Crew Allocation:** Every commercial project receives the same senior technical resource allocation as a residential project. There is no junior crew tier assigned to larger or more straightforward jobs. The technicians who install a 500 m² office roof are the same technicians who would install a 15 m² bay window roof — selected and managed for technical competence, not for cost efficiency.

## BREEAM and LEED Compliance

Environmental building certification — BREEAM and LEED — is increasingly specified in commercial development briefs from international promoters, corporate tenants with ESG commitments, and lenders offering green finance instruments for certified assets.

**BREEAM Credits Supported by EPDM Specification:**

| BREEAM Category | Credit | How EPDM Contributes |
|---|---|---|
| Materials | Mat 01 — Life Cycle Assessment | EPD-documented EPDM reduces embodied carbon score in LCA model |
| Materials | Mat 03 — Responsible Sourcing | ISO 14001-certified manufacturer supply chain documentation |
| Water | Wat 02 — Water Calculation | Green roof or cool roof system manages rainfall at source |
| Energy | Ene 01 — Energy Performance | Improved roof U-value reduces annual energy demand in RECS model |
| Pollution | Pol 03 — Surface Water Runoff | Green roof over EPDM reduces peak runoff coefficient |

BREEAM assessors in Portugal are familiar with EPDM as the preferred membrane for green roof assemblies. Membriko provides the EPD documentation, system specification, and installation certification required to support a BREEAM Materials category submission. All evidence documentation is available in English for submission to international assessment platforms.

**LEED v4 Credits Supported:**

| LEED Credit | How EPDM Contributes |
|---|---|
| MR: Building Product Disclosure — EPD | Environmental Product Declarations available from major EPDM manufacturers |
| MR: Construction and Demolition Waste | EPDM offcuts are thermally recyclable — waste documentation provided |
| SS: Heat Island Effect — Roof | SRI ≥ 29 (low slope) achieved with light-coloured EPDM topcoat system |
| EA: Minimum Energy Performance Prerequisite | Improved U-values contribute to ASHRAE 90.1 / RECS compliance in energy model |

Membriko's experience in projects requiring green building certification includes technical support to the certification team, preparation of the materials evidence dossier, and participation in technical verification site visits by the assessor.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Can EPDM membrane be installed with the building in full operation?**

Yes — and this is one of the most significant practical advantages of EPDM in commercial environments. Membriko's cold installation process requires no open flame, no hot bitumen, and generates no solvent odours at occupant level. This means installation can proceed in fully occupied commercial buildings without requiring closure or tenant notification. We work with your facilities management team to agree access zones, working hours, and a phased programme that keeps the building protected and fully operational throughout the works.

**2. What is the impact on the building's energy certificate?**

Significant — particularly for pre-2000 commercial stock. If existing roof insulation is degraded or under-specified, installing new PIR insulation under a new EPDM membrane can improve the roof U-value from 0.80 W/m²K or worse to 0.21 W/m²K. This directly raises the building's energy class in the RECS simulation. Membriko can provide a preliminary estimate of the energy class improvement based on existing building data before any commitment to works.

**3. How is EPDM integrated with existing HVAC equipment on the roof?**

All existing HVAC units, condensers, and services are integrated using prefabricated EPDM details — raised curb membranes, pipe boots, and pressure plate seals. Where necessary, Membriko coordinates with the HVAC contractor to temporarily lift equipment, install the EPDM base and support curb, and reinstate the equipment. Every singular point receives a factory-fabricated detail — not mastic or site-formed aluminium flashing.

**4. What warranty is available for large commercial buildings?**

Membriko's standard 20-year installation warranty applies to all commercial projects. For critical infrastructure — hospitals, data centres, and large office complexes — Membriko can specify systems carrying manufacturer warranties of up to 40 years, covering material and workmanship when installed by a certified applicator. Both warranties are transferable on property sale and are documented in the building's technical file.

**5. Does EPDM satisfy BREEAM requirements for green building certification?**

Yes. EPDM from manufacturers publishing Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to EN 15804 directly supports the BREEAM Mat 01 Life Cycle Assessment credit. EPDM also contributes to Ene 01 (energy performance through improved U-values), Wat 02 (rainfall management, particularly in green roof assemblies), and Pol 03 (surface water runoff). Membriko provides all required documentation for the BREEAM assessor's evidence file, in English.

**6. How long does installation take for a 2,000 m² commercial roof?**

A 2,000 m² commercial roof installation with standard penetration density typically takes 8 to 12 working days for the primary membrane field. Singular points — penetrations, drainage, upstands, equipment curbs — add 2 to 4 days. The complete project — including substrate preparation, membrane installation, singular points, quality control testing, and as-built documentation — is typically delivered in 3 to 4 weeks. Projects with phased delivery requirements can be structured to complete one building wing or zone per week.

**7. Is EPDM membrane compatible with rooftop photovoltaic installations?**

Yes. EPDM is the preferred substrate for ballasted photovoltaic installations on flat commercial roofs. PV mounting frames are placed on rubber-footed aluminium rail systems that distribute load without penetrating the membrane. Where penetrating fixings are required, Membriko installs EPDM pipe boots and pressure plate seals at each penetration. Membriko coordinates with the PV installer to ensure the waterproofing and photovoltaic installation sequence is correct and that no membrane damage occurs during the PV installation phase.

**8. Can EPDM be installed over existing bituminous waterproofing?**

In many cases, yes. EPDM can be installed as an overlay onto existing APP or SBS bitumen if the existing membrane is structurally sound, dry, and well adhered to the substrate. A compatibility primer is applied, and the EPDM membrane is mechanically fastened or adhered to the existing surface. This approach eliminates the cost and waste of full membrane removal and avoids disturbing potentially asbestos-containing components in pre-1985 Portuguese commercial roofing assemblies. A pre-installation condition survey determines whether overlay is appropriate for each specific project.
