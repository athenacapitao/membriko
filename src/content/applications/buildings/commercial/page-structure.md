# Commercial Buildings — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The commercial buildings page targets a distinct decision-maker profile from the residential
roofing pages: facilities managers, property development directors, quantity surveyors, building
services engineers, and institutional asset managers. These readers are experienced buyers. They
have been through waterproofing specification cycles before. They are not persuaded by generic
claims — they respond to technical depth, documented performance data, financial rigour, and
clear evidence that the contractor understands the commercial operational context.

The page must simultaneously serve two keyword clusters: the broad "impermeabilização edifícios
comerciais" search that captures early-stage research, and the more specific "EPDM edifício
comercial Portugal" and "membrana EPDM centro comercial" searches from buyers who already know
what they want and are selecting a contractor. The structure therefore alternates between broad
context (for the first group) and dense technical specificity (for the second group), with
conversion prompts at two points — mid-page and at the close.

The section order follows a commercial buyer's decision arc:
1. Stakes — business consequences of commercial waterproofing failure (not just water damage)
2. Building types — demonstrate sector-specific expertise
3. Why EPDM — material science translated to commercial language
4. Warranty and lifecycle — the commercial buyer's primary concern
5. Installation without disruption — the operational constraint all commercial buyers cite
6. Rooftop equipment integration — the detail issue most contractors mishandle
7. EPDM vs alternatives — the specification comparison commercial buyers run
8. Energy certification — regulatory compliance framed as a commercial value driver
9. Fire safety — eliminate the compliance doubt before it becomes an objection
10. Technical specifications — the data table for engineer/specifier readers
11. Maintenance programs — the asset management framing that institutional buyers require
12. Portuguese commercial market — local context and Membriko positioning
13. BREEAM and LEED — green certification, increasingly a tender requirement
14. FAQ — capture long-tail search, address pre-sales queries
15. CTA — final conversion prompt

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Establish the commercial stakes — disruption, liability, asset value — before any
product mention.

**Content:**
- Headline: "Impermeabilização de Edifícios Comerciais: Uma Decisão de Activo, Não de Manutenção"
  (Commercial waterproofing is an asset decision, not a maintenance decision)
- Sub-headline: A failed commercial roof is a business disruption event. EPDM's 50-year service
  life eliminates the reinvestment cycle entirely.
- Four stat blocks: 50+ anos de vida útil comprovada / Garantia de instalação de 20 anos /
  -45°C a +150°C gama de serviço / Instalação sem encerramento da actividade
- CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico Técnico" (primary) + "Ver Especificações Técnicas" anchor (secondary)
- Background: Aerial photograph of a large commercial roof with HVAC equipment visible — conveys
  the scale and complexity of the commercial context

**Design note:** The hero stat block should emphasise "sem encerramento da actividade" (without
business closure) — this is consistently cited as the primary concern of commercial operators
and differentiates the commercial page from residential roofing pages.

## Section 2: Building Types — Sector-Specific Expertise

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko understands the specific waterproofing challenges of each
commercial building category — not a generic pitch.

**Content:** Four building type cards, each with: building type, primary challenge, Membriko
approach.

1. **Edifícios de Escritórios (Office Buildings)**
   - Challenge: High penetration density (HVAC, conduit, antennae), concealed water damage behind
     suspended ceilings, BMS and data infrastructure at risk
   - Membriko approach: Full penetration survey before specification, prefabricated EPDM pipe boots
     for all services, no exposed mastic on any singular point

2. **Centros Comerciais e Retalho (Shopping Centres and Retail)**
   - Challenge: Large roof areas, 24/7 operational constraints, existing SBS bitumen approaching
     end of life, torch work prohibited in occupied retail environments
   - Membriko approach: Cold-applied EPDM installation — no open flame, no fumes, compatible with
     occupied building operation; phased installation to maintain continuous roof coverage

3. **Hotéis e Alojamento Turístico (Hotels and Tourism Accommodation)**
   - Challenge: Guest experience impact of any failure, accessible terraces and podium pools,
     high UV exposure in coastal locations, reputation damage on review platforms
   - Membriko approach: EPDM root-resistant systems for green and amenity terrace roofs,
     extended manufacturer warranties for critical hospitality assets

4. **Hospitais e Unidades de Saúde (Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities)**
   - Challenge: Zero-tolerance for failure, complex penetration density, sterile environment
     integrity, mandatory long-term documentation for asset registers
   - Membriko approach: 40-year manufacturer warranty systems specified for critical healthcare
     infrastructure, comprehensive as-built documentation package, LNEC-approved systems

**Visual:** Four-column card layout with building type icon, brief description, and "Ver Mais"
link per card.

## Section 3: Why EPDM for Commercial Buildings

**Purpose:** Translate EPDM's material science into commercial building owner language — durability,
reliability, operating cost — not polymer chemistry.

**Content:**

**Five commercial advantages with brief technical grounding:**

1. **Eliminates the 15-Year Replacement Cycle**
   - SBS and APP bitumen systems installed in the 1990s Portuguese commercial stock are failing
     at 15 to 20 years. Each full roof replacement on a 5,000 m² commercial roof costs six figures
     and requires 4 to 6 weeks of access — with associated business disruption.
   - EPDM's 50+ year documented service life removes this cycle entirely from the asset's lifecycle.

2. **Cold Application — Safe for Occupied Buildings**
   - EPDM is installed cold, using contact adhesive or mechanical fasteners. No open flame,
     no hot bitumen, no fumes, no fire risk. The health and safety requirements for commercial
     sites occupied by staff and the public require exactly this approach.

3. **Elasticity That Accommodates Building Movement**
   - Large commercial buildings experience significant structural movement: thermal expansion of
     the reinforced concrete frame, live load deflection, and long-term creep. EPDM's 300 to 500%
     elongation at break means it bridges substrate cracks and accommodates structural movement
     without stress concentration at the membrane.

4. **Compatible with All Rooftop Equipment**
   - EPDM's chemical inertness makes it compatible with aluminium, steel, copper, and plastic
     service elements. It does not react with galvanic coupling or chemical leaching from HVAC
     drains. No membrane protection or sacrificial layer required around equipment bases.

5. **Lowest 30-Year Total Cost of Ownership**
   - When replacement, maintenance, and disruption costs are factored in, EPDM's 30-year TCO
     is substantially lower than bituminous systems despite a higher initial installation cost.
     This is the financial argument that converts commercial asset managers.

**Visual:** Five benefit cards with icon, title, two-sentence expansion. Consider a TCO bar chart
showing EPDM vs bitumen over 30 years.

## Section 4: Warranty and Building Lifecycle

**Purpose:** Address the commercial buyer's primary risk — the cost of failure in a complex,
occupied asset.

**Content:**

**Membriko Warranty Structure:**
- 20-year Membriko installation warranty (workmanship and material): issued as a registered
  warranty certificate, transferable on property sale, documented in the building's technical file
- Manufacturer material warranty: up to 40 years for critical infrastructure applications using
  specified manufacturer systems
- Portuguese statutory defect liability: 5 years under Código Civil Art. 1225 — the Membriko
  20-year warranty supplements and extends beyond the statutory minimum

**Building Lifecycle Integration:**
- EPDM installed today on a commercial building under construction or refurbishment remains
  serviceable through at least 2 to 3 full tenancy cycles without replacement
- Property valuers and institutional investors recognise remaining EPDM warranty as a positive
  factor in building assessment — reducing the provision required for near-term capital expenditure
- Asset management documentation: Membriko provides a full technical file (specification,
  as-built drawings, inspection records, warranty certificate) formatted for integration into
  property management software

**Visual:** Lifecycle timeline graphic showing EPDM service life vs building ownership periods
and tenancy cycles. Highlight "no replacement required" periods.

## Section 5: Installation Without Business Disruption

**Purpose:** Directly address the most-cited commercial client objection to roof refurbishment:
the operational disruption.

**Content:**

**Why EPDM Enables Work Over Occupied Buildings:**

- **No open flame.** Cold-applied EPDM eliminates the fire risk and associated hot-work permit
  requirements that make torch-applied bitumen incompatible with occupied commercial premises.
  No H&S interface with FM team on hot-work procedures.

- **No VOC fumes at working level.** Water-based and low-VOC EPDM adhesive systems eliminate the
  solvent odour that causes complaints and potential health concerns in occupied buildings. Building
  management does not need to notify tenants of chemical exposure risk.

- **No structural load interruption.** EPDM installations do not require the structural slab to
  be cleared of equipment. Work can proceed around existing HVAC units, services, and fittings.

- **Phased delivery.** Large commercial roof areas can be divided into working phases of 200 to
  500 m², with each phase made watertight before the team moves to the next. The building remains
  protected throughout, with no extended uncovered area.

- **Overnight continuity.** At the end of each working day, any uncompleted section is sealed with
  temporary protection. No roof area is left exposed overnight to weather risk.

**Membriko Commercial Site Management Protocol:**
- Pre-installation site survey and access planning with building management
- Written method statement and risk assessment provided before mobilisation
- Daily progress reports to FM team
- Phased handover with interim flood test certificates for each completed section

**Visual:** Diagram showing phased installation zones on a typical commercial roof plan. Timeline
showing working-day phases with protection at end of each phase.

## Section 6: Rooftop Equipment Integration

**Purpose:** Demonstrate the technical competence that commercial HVAC and building services
engineers need to see before trusting a waterproofing contractor.

**Content:**

**The Penetration Problem in Commercial Buildings:**

A typical commercial office building of 3,000 m² GFA may have 30 to 60 roof penetrations:
drainage outlets, condenser unit feet, cable management conduits, lightning conductors, gas
service lines, fresh air intakes, and communications masts. Each penetration is a potential
failure point where the membrane must maintain complete watertightness while accommodating
movement and thermal cycling between the fixed service element and the building structure.

**Membriko Equipment Integration Details:**

- **HVAC condenser units:** Raised curb system with EPDM membrane wrapped up and over the curb,
  minimum 200 mm upstand. Prefabricated EPDM curb cap with pressure ring seal at the equipment
  base frame. Provision for 10 mm thermal movement between curb and frame via flexible EPDM skirt.

- **Drainage outlets:** Sumped cast-iron or EPDM-compatible polymer drains with bonded flange
  that accepts the EPDM membrane in a continuous wrap. No exposed clamp ring — the membrane
  passes under the clamping plate with compression seal.

- **Service conduits and pipes:** Prefabricated EPDM pipe boots in the correct diameter for each
  penetration. No mastic filling. Each boot is bonded to the primary membrane with overlap
  adhesive and mechanically secured at the pipe with a stainless-steel jubilee clamp over a
  butyl tape bed.

- **Lightning conductors:** EPDM saddle piece bonded over the conductor at roof level. The
  conductor passes through a grommeted sleeve in the saddle, sealed with compatible butyl tape.
  Earthing continuity maintained throughout.

- **Expansion joints:** Purpose-made EPDM expansion joint cover strips bonded to both sides of
  the joint with a central expansion loop providing 50 mm of movement accommodation in each
  direction. Tested to EN 1928 for watertightness under hydrostatic head.

**Quality Control:** Every singular point is individually inspected, photographed, and logged
in the as-built record. Electronic leak detection (ELD) is used across the full roof area after
completion to verify zero defects.

**Visual:** Detailed section drawings showing each of the five standard singular point details.

## Section 7: EPDM vs Alternatives for Commercial Specification

**Purpose:** Provide the comparison data that commercial specifiers and quantity surveyors need
to justify EPDM selection in a tender or value engineering exercise.

**Content:** Full comparison table plus narrative context for each competitor.

| Feature | EPDM | TPO | PVC | Bitumen SBS/APP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Documented service life | 50+ years | 12-18 years | 20-30 years | 15-25 years |
| Installation method | Cold — no flame | Hot air weld | Hot air weld | Gas torch |
| Compatible with occupied buildings | Yes — no flame, low VOC | Partial — weld fumes | Partial — weld fumes | No — fire risk |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic to chemistry | Good; seam UV risk | Good with plasticiser | Requires protection layer |
| Plasticiser migration risk | None — no plasticisers | None | Yes — progressive stiffening | N/A |
| Root resistance (EN 13948) | Yes | Depends on formulation | Depends on formulation | With copper foil additive |
| BREEAM / LEED EPD availability | Yes (major manufacturers) | Yes (some) | Yes (some) | Limited |
| End-of-life recyclability | Yes — 100% thermally recyclable | Yes | Complex — chlorine content | Limited |
| 30-year TCO vs EPDM | Lowest | 15-25% higher | 20-30% higher | 40-50% higher |

**Narrative context below table:**

TPO is a legitimate choice for budget-driven commercial projects with a planned refurbishment
cycle within 15 years. Its cool-roof reflectivity is genuinely valuable in cooling-dominated
climates. However, for institutional owners seeking to maximise asset value over a full 25 to
30-year hold period, TPO does not match EPDM's lifecycle economics.

PVC's 30-year European track record makes it a defensible specification in Northern European
conditions. In Portugal's higher-temperature climate, the plasticiser migration rate is
significantly higher, compressing the effective service life and bringing forward the replacement
obligation.

Bituminous systems (SBS/APP) should be understood as legacy technology for new commercial
specifications. Their continued market share reflects familiar specification habits rather than
technical merit. The torch application risk, surface oxidation requirement, and 15-year
replacement cycle are all commercially inferior to EPDM in any lifecycle analysis.

## Section 8: Energy Certification Benefits

**Purpose:** Position EPDM as a contributor to regulatory compliance and energy rating improvement
— a commercial value driver, not merely a membrane.

**Content:**

**RECS Compliance (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Comércio e Serviços):**

All commercial buildings in Portugal require an energy certificate (certificado energético) issued
under DL 118/2013. The roof's U-value is a direct input to the energy simulation that determines
the building's energy class. Improving from a class E or D rating (common for 1990s commercial
stock with degraded insulation) to class B or higher typically requires both new insulation and
a new waterproofing membrane that is compatible with the insulation system.

**U-Value Targets and EPDM System Performance:**

| Climate Zone | RECS Max. U-value (Roof) | EPDM + 100mm PIR | EPDM + 150mm PIR |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 / V1 (Mild — most of Portugal's coast) | 0.50 W/m²K | 0.21 W/m²K ✓ | 0.15 W/m²K ✓ |
| I2 / V2 (Moderate — interior and north) | 0.40 W/m²K | 0.21 W/m²K ✓ | 0.15 W/m²K ✓ |
| I3 / V3 (Severe — high altitude interior) | 0.35 W/m²K | 0.21 W/m²K ✓ | 0.15 W/m²K ✓ |

**Cool Roof Option:**

White or light grey EPDM topcoat systems achieve Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) values of 65 to 85,
reducing rooftop surface temperatures by 15 to 25°C relative to black EPDM in summer conditions.
For commercial buildings in Portugal's V3 cooling zone (Alentejo interior, Algarve), cool roof
specification can reduce cooling energy demand by 8 to 15%, with corresponding improvement in
annual energy performance.

## Section 9: Fire Safety for Commercial Buildings

**Purpose:** Eliminate the fire compliance doubt before it becomes a barrier to specification.

**Content:**

**SCIE Framework for Commercial Buildings:**

Portaria 1532/2008 classifies commercial buildings into utilisation categories (Utilizações-Tipo)
that determine fire safety requirements. The three most relevant for waterproofing specification:

- **UT III (Administrative):** Offices, public administration, and similar. Roofing materials
  must meet minimum class E reaction to fire. EPDM satisfies this requirement directly.

- **UT VIII (Commercial or Service):** Shopping centres, hypermarkets, restaurants. Larger
  establishments may require BROOF(t4) external fire performance classification for roof
  coverings in the vicinity of property boundaries or in covered arcade configurations.

- **UT XII (Healthcare):** Hospitals and clinical facilities. No specific external fire performance
  class for waterproofing is prescribed beyond UT III requirements, but fire compartmentation
  and escape route clarity over occupied rooftops must be maintained.

**EPDM Fire Performance:**

- Reaction to fire: Class E (EN 13501-1) — material does not sustain flame propagation once
  ignition source is removed
- External fire performance (BROOF): Standard EPDM membrane does not achieve BROOF(t4) without
  additional protection. Where required, a mineral ballast overlay (50 kg/m² rounded gravel,
  minimum 50 mm depth) or a fire-rated mineral board overlay achieves the BROOF(t4) classification.
  This is a standard detail in Membriko's commercial specification toolkit.

**Cold Application and Hot Work Permits:**

A practical but critically important point: EPDM's cold installation method means no hot-work
permit is required. In occupied commercial buildings where a Permit to Work system is in operation,
eliminating the hot-work category of work simplifies the site management process and removes the
requirement for a fire watch during and after application. This is not a minor administrative
benefit — it significantly reduces the FM interface overhead during a commercial refurbishment.

hot-work permit elimination.

## Section 12: Portuguese Commercial Market Context

**Purpose:** Local authority statement — show Membriko understands the Portuguese commercial
property market, not just the material.

**Content:**

**Market Context:**

Portugal's commercial property market has experienced significant investment activity since 2015,
with major domestic and international institutional investors acquiring office parks, logistics
hubs, and retail assets concentrated in the Lisbon metropolitan area, the Porto region, and the
A1 corridor. A substantial proportion of this investment stock consists of 1980s to 2000s
construction with aging waterproofing systems requiring upgrading to maintain asset value and
energy class certification.

**Membriko's Geographic Position:**

Based in Pombal, Membriko is strategically positioned at the centre of mainland Portugal's
north-south axis — equidistant from Lisbon (approximately 150 km south) and Porto (approximately
150 km north), and directly accessible via the A1 motorway that connects the country's two primary
commercial real estate markets. This location enables rapid mobilisation to commercial projects
across the full country without the logistics overhead of Lisbon or Porto-based contractors.

**Sector Experience:**

Membriko's commercial portfolio includes office complexes, logistics and industrial buildings,
educational facilities, healthcare units, and hospitality properties across the central region and
beyond. Every commercial project receives the same senior technical resource allocation as a
residential project — there is no junior crew tier for larger or simpler jobs.

**Language Capability:**

For multinational corporate clients, Membriko's technical documentation is available in both
Portuguese and English, including specification documents, as-built reports, and warranty
certificates. This serves international property owners managing Portuguese assets from
headquarters in other European countries.

## Section 13: BREEAM and LEED Compliance

**Purpose:** Position Membriko and EPDM within the green building certification frameworks
that are increasingly specified in commercial development briefs.

**Content:**

**BREEAM Credits Supported by EPDM Specification:**

| BREEAM Category | Credit | How EPDM Contributes |
|---|---|---|
| Materials | Mat 01 — Life Cycle Assessment | EPD-documented EPDM reduces embodied carbon score |
| Materials | Mat 03 — Responsible Sourcing | ISO 14001-certified manufacturer supply chain |
| Water | Wat 02 — Water Calculation | Green roof or cool roof systems manage storm water |
| Energy | Ene 01 — Energy Performance | Improved roof U-value reduces energy demand |
| Pollution | Pol 03 — Surface Water Runoff | EPDM on green roof basis reduces peak runoff |

BREEAM assessors in Portugal are familiar with EPDM as a preferred membrane for green roof
assemblies. Membriko provides the EPD documentation, system specification, and installation
certification required to support a BREEAM Materials submission.

**LEED v4 Credits Supported:**

| LEED Credit | Relevance |
|---|---|
| MR Credit: Building Product Disclosure (EPD) | EPDM EPDs available from major manufacturers |
| MR Credit: Construction and Demolition Waste | EPDM offcuts are recyclable — waste documentation available |
| SS Credit: Heat Island Effect — Roof | SRI ≥ 29 (low slope) achieved with cool roof EPDM topcoat |
| EA Prerequisite: Minimum Energy Performance | Improved U-values contribute to energy model compliance |

**Practical Support:**

Membriko provides the following documentation to BREEAM and LEED assessors on request:
manufacturer EPDs (in English and Portuguese), system specification sheets with tested U-values,
material compliance declarations, and installation certificates that can be uploaded to the
certification platform's evidence management system.

---

## Section 14: FAQ

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail commercial search queries and eliminate pre-sales questions that
delay the decision to contact Membriko.

Eight questions specifically addressing commercial buyer concerns:

1. **Podem instalar membrana EPDM com o edifício em funcionamento?**
   Yes — this is one of EPDM's primary advantages in commercial settings. Because EPDM is cold-
   applied (no open flame, no hot bitumen, no solvent fumes at working level), installation can
   proceed on occupied commercial buildings without requiring closure. We work with your FM team
   to agree access zones, working hours, and a phased programme that keeps the building protected
   and operational throughout.

2. **Qual é o impacto no certificado energético do edifício?**
   Significant. If the existing roof insulation is degraded (common in pre-2000 Portuguese
   commercial stock), installing new PIR insulation under a new EPDM membrane can improve the
   roof U-value from 0.80 W/m²K or worse to 0.21 W/m²K — a fourfold improvement. This directly
   raises the building's energy class in the RECS simulation. We can provide a preliminary
   estimate of the energy class improvement based on the existing building data before committing
   to the project.

3. **Como se integra o EPDM com os equipamentos AVAC existentes na cobertura?**
   All existing HVAC units, condensers, and services are integrated using prefabricated EPDM
   details — raised curb membranes, pipe boots, and pressure plate seals. Where necessary, we
   coordinate with your HVAC contractor to lift equipment temporarily, install the EPDM base
   and curb, and replace the equipment. Every singular point receives a prefabricated factory
   detail — not mastic or site-formed flashing.

4. **Qual a garantia disponível para edifícios comerciais de grande dimensão?**
   Membriko's standard 20-year installation warranty applies to all commercial projects. For
   critical infrastructure — hospitals, data centres, and large office complexes — we can specify
   systems that carry a manufacturer warranty of up to 40 years, covering both material and
   workmanship when installed by a certified applicator. Both warranties are transferable on
   property sale and are documented in the building's technical file.

5. **O EPDM cumpre os requisitos BREEAM para certificação verde?**
   Yes. EPDM from manufacturers who publish Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to EN 15804
   directly supports the BREEAM Mat 01 Life Cycle Assessment credit. EPDM also contributes to
   Ene 01 (energy performance via improved U-values), Wat 02 (storm water management, particularly
   in green roof assemblies), and Pol 03 (surface water runoff). Membriko provides all required
   documentation for the BREEAM assessor's evidence file.

6. **Quanto tempo demora a instalação numa cobertura comercial de 2.000 m²?**
   A 2,000 m² commercial roof installation with standard penetration density typically takes 8 to
   12 working days for the primary membrane. Singular points (penetrations, drainage, upstands,
   equipment curbs) add 2 to 4 additional days. The full project — including substrate preparation,
   membrane installation, singular points, quality control testing, and as-built documentation —
   is typically completed in 3 to 4 weeks. Projects with phased delivery can be structured to
   complete one wing or zone per week.

7. **A membrana EPDM é compatível com painéis fotovoltaicos instalados na cobertura?**
   Yes. EPDM is the preferred substrate for ballasted photovoltaic installations on flat commercial
   roofs. PV mounting frames are placed on rubber-footed aluminium rails that distribute load
   without penetrating the membrane. Where penetrating fixings are required, EPDM pipe boots and
   pressure plates seal each penetration without compromise to the membrane field. We coordinate
   with the PV installer to ensure the waterproofing and PV installation sequence is correct.

8. **É possível instalar EPDM por cima da impermeabilização existente (sobre o betume)?**
   In many cases, yes. EPDM can be installed over existing APP or SBS bitumen if the existing
   membrane is structurally sound, dry, and well adhered. A compatibility primer is applied,
   and the EPDM is either mechanically fastened or adhered to the existing surface. This
   eliminates the cost and waste of full membrane removal and avoids disturbing potentially
   asbestos-containing components in pre-1985 Portuguese commercial roofing assemblies. A
   condition survey determines whether overlay is appropriate for a specific project.
