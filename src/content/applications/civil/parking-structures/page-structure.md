# Parking Structures — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Car park waterproofing is one of the highest-value project categories in Portuguese civil
construction. The typical underground car park beneath a residential development or shopping
centre represents 500 to 3,000 m² of waterproofing area — ten times the average residential
flat roof project. Targeting specifiers, developers, structural engineers and facilities managers
who control this procurement is therefore a priority for Membriko's commercial positioning.

The page must speak simultaneously to two distinct audiences:
1. Technical specifiers (structural and civil engineers, architects) who need precise performance
   data, regulatory compliance information and installation methodology detail.
2. Property developers and facilities managers who need to understand the financial case for
   specifying EPDM over cheaper alternatives, and the risk consequences of inadequate waterproofing
   in a car park environment.

The persuasion structure follows the same arc as other Membriko application pages — stakes,
science, proof, method, compliance, comparison, ROI — but with emphasis on the regulatory
complexity unique to car parks (SCIE, Eurocodes, DL 220/2008) and the traffic-bearing system
design that distinguishes car park from conventional roofing applications.

The eight FAQs target the specific objections and technical questions that arise in car park
procurement: compatibility with wearing courses, performance under de-icing salt, maintenance
under traffic, fire compliance, and cost versus liquid-applied alternatives.

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Establish the scale of the problem and the stakes of failure.

**Content:**
- Headline: "Impermeabilização de Estacionamentos: A Infra-estrutura que Protege Tudo o Resto"
- Sub-headline: Car park waterproofing failures are among the most expensive infrastructure
  failures in Portuguese construction — rebar corrosion, slab spalling, and structural
  remediation costs dwarf the original waterproofing budget. EPDM is the system that prevents
  this outcome.

  combustíveis / 20 anos de garantia

## Section 3: Why EPDM for Car Parks

**Purpose:** Technical rationale for EPDM in this specific demanding environment.

**Content:**
- Polymer chemistry: saturated backbone, cross-linked network, resistance to hydrocarbon and
  chemical attack
- Elongation under traffic-induced slab deflection
- Performance under freeze-thaw cycling (exposed decks)
- Absence of plasticisers (unlike PVC) — no degradation mechanism under oil and fuel contact
- Single-ply simplicity vs. multi-layer liquid systems

   - EPDM for slab and wall waterproofing
   - Integration with drainage channels and sumps

2. **Multi-Storey Car Parks (Estacionamentos Elevados)**
   - Inter-deck waterproofing with wearing course system
   - Exposure to rain, UV (rooftop level) and thermal cycling
   - Expansion joint design and EPDM detail

3. **Rooftop Car Parks (Estacionamentos em Cobertura)**
   - Combined waterproofing and thermal insulation requirements
   - Traffic-bearing system design for cars, emergency vehicles
   - Interface with building structure below
