# Car Park Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## The Infrastructure That Protects Everything Below

Car parks are among the most deceptive structures in Portuguese construction. Their waterproofing failures are invisible until the consequences become undeniable — and by the time staining appears on underground car park ceilings, concrete spalls from inter-deck soffits, or rusted rebar pushes through the surface of a multi-storey car park deck, the structural damage that has accumulated behind that visible symptom is almost certainly far more expensive to remediate than the waterproofing system itself would have cost to install correctly in the first place.

Membriko was established in Pombal with a straightforward conviction: waterproofing quality is not a line item to cut; it is the investment that determines total cost of ownership over a building's service life. In no application is this principle more clearly demonstrated than in car park structures. Our exclusive specialisation in EPDM rubber membrane systems, applied across hundreds of civil and commercial projects in Portugal, gives us a depth of technical capability that generalist waterproofing contractors — who install EPDM alongside bitumen, PVC, and liquid coatings, whichever is cheapest this week — simply cannot replicate.

This page covers everything a structural engineer, architect, developer, or facilities manager needs to understand about EPDM waterproofing in car park structures: the material science, the system design for underground, multi-storey and rooftop car parks, traffic-bearing system design, chemical resistance to oil, fuel and de-icing agents, fire safety compliance under DL 220/2008, and the Membriko installation process that eliminates the root causes of car park waterproofing failure.

## Portuguese Car Park Infrastructure: Scale and Urgency

Portugal operates approximately 1.2 million formal parking spaces in constructed facilities — underground car parks beneath residential and commercial developments, multi-storey structures in urban centres, and rooftop car parks over shopping centres, logistics hubs and mixed-use developments. The majority of Portugal's structured car park stock was built between 1985 and 2010, a period when waterproofing was dominated by APP modified bitumen sheet and, to a lesser extent, plasticised PVC membranes. These systems, installed with design service lives of 20 to 25 years, are now at or beyond that limit.

What happens when a car park waterproofing system fails? The sequence is consistent and expensive. Water infiltrates through the deteriorated membrane or its seams, percolates through the protection layer, and contacts the structural reinforced concrete slab. Car park slabs fall into Exposure Class XD3 under EN 1992-1-1 (Eurocode 2) — reinforcement corrosion induced by chlorides, cyclic wet and dry. In this class, chloride ions — from de-icing salts tracked in by vehicles in winter, or from chlorinated cleaning water — initiate electrochemical corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Corrosion products occupy two and a half to six times the volume of the original steel, generating expansive stress inside the concrete that fractures the cover and exposes the rebar. The visible manifestations are the blistering, spalling and rusting that property owners recognise as signs that the car park is failing structurally, not merely cosmetically.

Based on remediation projects Membriko has surveyed, the cost of structural repair to a car park with established chloride penetration is typically five to twelve times the cost of the original waterproofing installation. The economic case for investing in quality waterproofing is unambiguous.

## Why EPDM is the Right Material for Car Parks

EPDM — Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer rubber — was not developed for the car park market. It was developed as an industrial sealing material, and its adoption in civil and building waterproofing follows directly from the properties that made it valuable in demanding industrial applications: broad-spectrum chemical resistance, exceptional thermal stability, permanent elasticity without dependence on plasticisers, and a service life that no competing material can match.

### The Saturated Backbone: The Foundation of Chemical Resistance

EPDM's polymer chain is composed of ethylene and propylene monomers — saturated hydrocarbons — joined by single carbon-carbon bonds. This saturation is the origin of the material's chemical resistance. Polymer degradation reactions — oxidation, solvent attack, hydrolysis — occur preferentially at the most reactive sites in the molecular structure: unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and polar functional groups. EPDM's main chain has neither. The absence of reactive sites means that the agents which degrade other waterproofing materials — ultraviolet radiation, ozone, hydrocarbons, chloride solutions — have no primary mechanism of attack on the EPDM polymer backbone.

In car park environments, the primary chemical aggressors are hydrocarbons (engine oil, fuels, brake fluid, transmission fluid) and chlorides (de-icing salts, chlorinated cleaning products). EPDM is chemically inert to both. This inertness is not a surface treatment, not an additive that depletes over time — it is structural, intrinsic to the molecular architecture of the vulcanised elastomer. Membriko specifies EPDM for car parks because the properties that matter in this environment are permanent, not temporary.

### Elongation Under Traffic-Induced Slab Deflection

Reinforced concrete slabs in car parks deflect under vehicular loading — this is an unavoidable physical reality. A 200 mm thick slab over an 8 metre span deflects 5 to 15 mm under maximum vehicle load. Over years of service, concrete shrinkage, creep, and differential foundation settlement add further movement to the substrate. A waterproofing membrane without adequate elongation will crack under these demands and become a water entry point.

EPDM achieves elongation at break in excess of 300% to EN 13956, and the products Membriko specifies typically reach 350 to 450% in independent testing. In practice, this means EPDM can bridge concrete cracks of several millimetres of opening width without damage to the membrane. This crack-bridging capacity is one of the most important technical arguments for EPDM in concrete structures where substrate movement is predictable and unavoidable.

### No Plasticisers: The Advantage That Compounds Over Time

PVC roofing and waterproofing membranes require substantial quantities of plasticisers — typically phthalate compounds — to achieve the flexibility necessary for installation and service. These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to the PVC matrix; they are physically dispersed through it, and they migrate outward progressively under the influence of heat, ultraviolet radiation, and solvent contact. In a car park environment — where temperature cycling is significant, UV exposure occurs on exposed deck areas, and hydrocarbon contact accelerates plasticiser extraction — this migration proceeds at an elevated rate. The result is a progressively stiffer, more brittle membrane that eventually cracks.

EPDM contains no plasticisers. Its flexibility is an inherent property of the cross-linked rubber network — it cannot be extracted or depleted. A Membriko EPDM installation in a car park deck will have the same flexibility and elongation properties after twenty years of service as it had on the day of installation. This is the difference between a material whose properties are stable and one whose properties degrade by design.

## Types of Car Park Structure and EPDM Solutions

Membriko works across the three principal car park structure types found in Portugal, each presenting distinct waterproofing challenges and requiring specific design responses.

### Underground Car Parks

Underground car parks are the most technically demanding parking structures from a waterproofing perspective. The combination of hydrostatic pressure from groundwater (in sites with a high water table), vehicular traffic loading on the inter-deck slabs, and absence of natural ventilation-assisted drying creates conditions most favourable to accelerated failure of inadequate waterproofing systems.

Membriko approaches underground car parks with a fully bonded EPDM system at 2.0 mm thickness for the base slab and walls in contact with damp ground, and 1.5 to 2.0 mm for inter-deck slabs. Fully bonded installation — as opposed to mechanically fastened or ballasted — is mandatory in underground car parks because it eliminates the possibility of sub-membrane water migration in the event of a localised entry at a singular point. All singular points receive prefabricated EPDM accessories: floor drains with integrated EPDM flanges, expansion joints with moulded EPDM profiles, pipe and cable penetrations with EPDM sealing boots and pressure rings, and wall upstands with a minimum 200 mm height above finished floor level.

Watertightness is verified before the protection layer is installed. The test method Membriko uses is the flood test (adapted from EN 1187 methodology for horizontal surfaces) or, where the substrate geometry makes flood testing impractical, the electric field holiday detection method.

### Multi-Storey Car Parks

Multi-storey car parks — above-ground structures with multiple parking levels — present a specific advantage from a maintenance perspective: the inter-deck slabs are visible on their underside (as the ceiling of the level below), meaning any infiltration becomes visible relatively quickly. This visibility is, paradoxically, a benefit: waterproofing in multi-storey car parks is more easily monitored than in underground structures.

The EPDM waterproofing system for inter-deck slabs in multi-storey car parks follows a trafficked deck assembly with a wearing course. The typical assembly from bottom to top is: structural concrete slab / primer / EPDM membrane 1.5-2.0 mm / protection layer / wearing course (mastic asphalt or polymer concrete). The EPDM membrane is not exposed to direct traffic — it is protected by the wearing course — which means the performance demands on the EPDM are focused precisely where it excels: watertightness, elongation for substrate movement, and chemical resistance to fuel and oil drips through the wearing course.

The uppermost exposed deck level, if open to the sky, is treated as an exposed trafficked rooftop, with the additional requirements of UV resistance (met by EPDM without additional protective coatings) and drainage design for direct rainfall.

### Rooftop Car Parks

Rooftop car parks over commercial or mixed-use buildings — a common configuration above Portuguese shopping centres, logistics warehouses and hypermarkets — combine the requirements of a trafficked flat roof with those of a car park slab. They are the most demanding configuration: direct UV and rainfall exposure, surface temperatures reaching 70 to 80°C in Portuguese summer conditions, vehicular and emergency vehicle loading, and the absolute requirement not to cause disruption to the commercial or operational activity in the floors below.

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for rooftop car parks, with an inverted roof slab configuration where the project includes thermal insulation, and a direct slab system where the deck is purely trafficked without insulation requirement. Expansion joint detailing receives particular attention in rooftop car parks: joints occur at intervals of 15 to 25 metres in large-area structures, and the moulded EPDM joint profiles Membriko installs are designed to accommodate ±25 to ±50 mm of movement without compromising watertightness.

---

## Traffic-Bearing Systems Over EPDM

The interface between the EPDM membrane and the traffic-bearing wearing course is one of the most technically critical — and most frequently misunderstood — aspects of car park waterproofing. It requires careful coordination between the waterproofing specification and the pavement engineering, and Membriko addresses it as part of the design process, not as a field decision.

EPDM is the watertight layer of the car park deck system, not the wearing surface. The correct assembly places the EPDM beneath a protection layer and a traffic-rated wearing course that carries all mechanical and abrasive loads from vehicular traffic. The EPDM's role is to prevent water and dissolved chlorides from reaching the structural slab, regardless of what happens at the surface above.

### Mastic Asphalt (Asfalto Coulée)

Mastic asphalt — polymer-modified bitumen applied in a fluid state at elevated temperature — is the most common wearing course material for interior car park decks in Portugal. Its compatibility with EPDM is acceptable provided specific conditions are met. The maximum temperature of contact between molten asphalt and the EPDM membrane must not exceed 160°C — above this, bond adhesives at seams soften and membrane distortion becomes possible. Before asphalt placement, a mechanical protection layer — typically glass-fibre reinforced board or lightweight concrete board — is installed over the EPDM membrane. In zones where asphalt application temperatures are near the limit, a loose-laid EPDM (rather than fully bonded) under the protection board accommodates the thermal load better.

Membriko coordinates with the paving subcontractor on the application temperature, sequence and timing of asphalt placement to ensure compatibility with the installed EPDM membrane.

### Polymer Concrete and Resin Systems

In higher-specification interior car parks and public parking facilities with specific aesthetic requirements, polymer concrete or epoxy/polyurethane resin systems serve as the wearing course over the protection layer. These systems are thinner than mastic asphalt (5 to 10 mm versus 25 to 50 mm), and their application temperature is compatible with EPDM without an intermediate protection board in most cases. Membriko specifies resin wearing courses whose compatibility with the EPDM substrate has been documented or tested by the manufacturer.

### Construction Traffic: The Immediate Threat

The most critical period for the integrity of an EPDM car park membrane is not the service phase — it is the construction phase. Mechanical plant, concrete loads, reinforcement delivery, and the traffic of subsequent trades after the membrane is installed but before the protection layer is in place represent the primary cause of puncture and mechanical damage to car park membranes. Membriko's installation protocol includes immediate temporary protection of the installed membrane with protection boards, followed by visual inspection before the permanent protection layer is placed. This step is non-negotiable.

## The Membriko Installation Method: Six Steps to Complete Watertightness

Membriko follows a structured, documented installation process that systematically eliminates the root causes of car park waterproofing failure. There are no informal variations — every step is executed to the established procedure and recorded with photographic evidence.

**Step 1 — Survey and Structural Assessment**

Membriko conducts a technical site visit before any quotation or specification. In car parks, the survey includes: measurement of existing slopes or review of design levels for fresh concrete slabs; identification of all floor drains, pipework penetrations, cable ducts and service connections; assessment of structural capacity to carry the waterproofing, protection and wearing course assembly loads; and, in renovation projects, inspection of the existing system to diagnose the extent of infiltration damage and evaluate the substrate condition.

**Step 2 — Drainage and Slope Design**

Membriko prepares the drainage layout and slope plan before work begins on site. For car parks, the drainage design specifies: minimum 1.5% slope to all drainage points; maximum drain spacing of 12 to 15 metres; sump drain positions at the lowest points of each drainage bay; and sizing of drain capacity for the design flow rate. For rooftop car parks with direct rainfall exposure, the design flow rate is calculated from local peak rainfall intensity — typically 100 to 150 litres per minute per square metre for the Pombal region.

**Step 3 — Surface Preparation and Priming**

The concrete slab is cleaned, de-dusted, and verified free of oil contamination, loose material and surface moisture before primer application. Membriko conducts the adhesion pull-off test (EN 12188) to verify that the concrete surface tensile strength exceeds 0.08 N/mm² — the minimum for reliable bonded membrane adhesion. Primer is applied by roller or airless spray in accordance with the membrane manufacturer's instructions, with full coverage and uniform film thickness.

**Step 4 — EPDM Membrane Installation**

EPDM is installed by the fully bonded method in all car park applications. Full bonding — as opposed to mechanical fastening or ballasting — is mandatory in car parks because it eliminates the possibility of sub-membrane water migration if a localised entry occurs at a singular point. EPDM sheets are seamed with factory-matched double-sided seam tape, applied with a roller to ensure full contact and air elimination. Seam overlaps are a minimum of 75 mm. Membriko uses exclusively seaming materials from the same product family as the membrane itself — no mixed-manufacturer seam systems, which create potential chemical incompatibility at the most vulnerable point of the installation.

**Step 5 — Singular Points: Drains, Joints, Penetrations and Upstands**

Singular points account for more than 80% of waterproofing failures in car park structures. Membriko treats every singular point with prefabricated EPDM accessories — not mastics that dry out and crack over time.

Floor drains receive EPDM-bonded flanges from the same elastomer family as the membrane sheet, secured with contact adhesive and butyl seam tape. Expansion joints are treated with moulded EPDM U-profiles that accommodate ±25 to ±50 mm of movement, bonded to both margins of the joint with contact adhesive. Pipe and cable penetrations receive prefabricated EPDM boots with a stainless-steel pressure ring clamped to the pipe and the EPDM boot bonded to the membrane. Wall and parapet upstands are dressed to a minimum height of 200 mm above finished floor level, with the top edge mechanically secured and covered by a metal termination bar.

**Step 6 — Protection Layer, Wearing Course and Watertightness Test**

After the membrane and all singular points are installed, Membriko conducts a watertightness test before the protection layer is placed. This test is non-negotiable: it is the only reliable means of detecting installation defects before they are concealed beneath permanent materials. Following successful test, the protection layer is installed and handed over to the paving contractor for the wearing course. Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty certificate, together with the photographic record of the complete installation process.

## Drainage and Slope Engineering

Drainage effectiveness is as important as the membrane itself. A perfect EPDM membrane in a car park with inadequate slopes will accumulate water at low points, creating additional hydrostatic load on the membrane, facilitating freeze-thaw damage in exposed structures, and accelerating biological fouling and sediment deposition that can block drains and compound drainage problems over time.

Membriko designs to a minimum slope of 1.5% for covered car parks — higher than the 1.0% minimum for flat roofs under RGEU, reflecting the greater volume of cleaning water that car park drainage must manage. For rooftop car parks exposed to direct rainfall, the minimum specified slope is 2.0%. The practical difference between 1.0% and 2.0% slope on a 500 m² car park is substantial: at 2.0%, the drain catchment drains approximately 2.5 times faster, and the standing water zone in the event of a blocked drain is significantly smaller.

Floor drains in car parks are sized for the cleaning water flow rate — typically 5 to 15 litres per minute per square metre of catchment — which in covered car parks often exceeds the design rainfall flow rate. Drains with debris-protection gratings are fitted with integrated EPDM flanges that eliminate the most vulnerable joint in a conventional drain assembly. The EPDM flange is pre-fabricated from the same elastomer as the membrane and bonded with the same adhesive system, producing a drain-to-membrane connection with no dissimilar material interface.

The drainage design documentation Membriko produces for each car park project includes: plan layout showing drain positions and catchment zones, slope diagrams showing fall direction and gradient from each point, cross-sections at all drains showing finished floor level relative to drain grating, and specification of drain type, capacity rating and maintenance access requirements.

## EPDM Versus Alternatives: Liquid-Applied, Bituminous and PVC Systems

Car park waterproofing specifications are frequently written around familiarity rather than technical merit — whichever system the specifier encountered on the previous project, whichever material the main contractor is most comfortable installing, whichever product appears cheapest in the initial schedule of rates. Membriko presents the technical and economic comparison transparently.

### Liquid-Applied Polyurethane and PMMA Systems

Liquid-applied systems — polyurethane or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) resins applied by roller or spray to form a continuous film — have a genuine advantage in geometrically complex details where seaming a sheet membrane is difficult. Membriko acknowledges this advantage. In some projects, particularly those with highly irregular penetration layouts or curved surfaces, the design basis for the detail treatment may be liquid-applied rather than sheet membrane.

In large-area car park decks, however, liquid-applied systems present significant limitations relative to EPDM. Film thickness in liquid application varies with technique, surface porosity, and applicator skill — thinner zones are disproportionately vulnerable, and measuring film thickness uniformly across a 1,000 m² surface is impractical. EPDM sheet is produced in factory-controlled conditions to a constant, verified thickness. Polyurethane systems require re-application every 8 to 15 years in trafficked applications — a maintenance cycle that, over a 50-year building life, produces a total cost of ownership substantially higher than EPDM despite a lower initial installation cost. PMMA systems are more durable than PU but significantly more expensive at installation, and the total cost comparison with EPDM over 50 years remains unfavourable.

### Modified Bitumen (APP and SBS Sheet)

Modified bitumen sheet was the dominant car park waterproofing material in Portugal from the 1980s through the early 2000s. Its principal limitation is service life: in a car park environment with significant thermal cycling, hydrocarbon exposure, and periodic high-pressure cleaning, APP bitumen achieves a realistic service life of 15 to 20 years. After this period, the bitumen oxidises, loses flexibility, and develops cracking — first at seams and perimeter details, then progressively across the field of the membrane.

Membriko regularly surveys car parks presenting for re-waterproofing after failure of bituminous systems installed in the 1990s or 2000s. The failure pattern is consistent: open seams at mid-deck locations, transverse cracking in zones of highest UV exposure on rooftop decks, delamination at parapet upstand details, and progressive structural concrete staining below. SBS bitumen performs better than APP in low-temperature flexibility but does not compete with EPDM in longevity or chemical resistance.

### PVC Sheet Membrane

Plasticised PVC membranes are rarely specified in car parks in Portugal for a technically well-founded reason: the plasticisers in PVC are extracted by the hydrocarbon environment of car parks. Contact with fuel spillages, solvent-based cleaning products, or vehicle fluids causes swelling, softening, and accelerated degradation of plasticised PVC. For car park applications, this limitation cannot be overcome without changing the base material.

| Criterion | EPDM (Membriko) | Liquid PU | APP Bitumen | PVC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Projected service life | 50+ years | 8-15 years | 15-20 years | 20-25 years |
| Oil and fuel resistance | Good (intermittent contact) | Good | Moderate | Poor |
| De-icing salt resistance | Excellent | Good | Moderate | Moderate |
| Installation condition sensitivity | Low | High (PU) | Medium | Medium |
| Factory-controlled thickness | Yes | No (site-applied) | Variable | Yes |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | 200-300% | 40-100% | 200-300% |
| 30-year maintenance cost | Minimal | High | Very high | High |
| Recyclability | Yes | Limited | Limited | No |

## Chemical Resistance: Oil, Fuel and De-icing Agents in Detail

The car park chemical environment is what distinguishes this application from all other waterproofing contexts. Membriko characterises the chemical aggressors in three categories and addresses each specifically.

### Hydrocarbons: Engine Oil and Vehicle Fuels

Parked vehicles drip engine oil, gearbox oil, power steering fluid, brake fluid and fuel. These are the primary hydrocarbon aggressors in any car park environment. EPDM, as noted in the material science section, resists intermittent exposure to these fluids effectively: swelling is modest and reversible, and mechanical properties are preserved above 85% of original values even after prolonged exposure in ASTM D471 immersion testing. Hydrocarbons do not break EPDM polymer bonds — there is no permanent chemical degradation, only a reversible physical swelling effect that subsides when the agressor is removed.

Brake fluid — predominantly polyglycol in DOT 3, DOT 4 and DOT 5.1 formulations — is fully compatible with EPDM. EPDM is, in fact, the material of choice for brake system seals and hoses in automotive engineering, where the combination of brake fluid contact resistance and temperature stability is essential.

For car parks with a high concentration of older or poorly maintained vehicles (high-turnover urban public car parks), Membriko recommends 2.0 mm EPDM in preference to 1.5 mm, providing a greater mechanical safety margin and additional thickness to accommodate any localised swelling without compromise to the watertight layer.

### De-icing Salts: Chloride Inertness as Structural Protection

De-icing salts — sodium chloride (NaCl) and in more severe applications calcium chloride (CaCl₂) — are applied to roads in Portugal's snow-affected mountain regions (Serra da Estrela, Peneda-Gerês, Montesinho) and are tracked into car parks by vehicles from treated road surfaces. EPDM is completely inert to chloride solutions at any concentration relevant to de-icing applications. The saturated polymer backbone does not react with chloride ions; the carbon black reinforcement does not corrode; there are no components extracted or degraded by brine solutions.

Membriko's technical position is that the resistance of EPDM to de-icing salts delivers a double benefit in car park structures: the membrane is itself unaffected by the chloride environment, and — more importantly — it prevents chloride ions from reaching the structural reinforcement in the concrete slab. An EPDM membrane with virtually zero chloride ion permeability, installed over the full slab area with correctly sealed singular points, effectively reduces the concrete cover requirement from Exposure Class XD3 (cyclic wet and dry with chloride exposure) to near-background conditions. This structural protection benefit is rarely quantified in waterproofing procurement decisions, but it represents a significant component of the total cost justification for EPDM over cheaper alternatives.

### Cleaning Agents and Maintenance Chemicals

Car parks are cleaned periodically with high-pressure water washing equipment and detergent solutions. EPDM is resistant to alkaline detergents (pH up to approximately 13) and dilute acids (pH above approximately 4). Concentrated acids — hydrochloric acid used for concrete lime scale removal — should not be applied directly to exposed EPDM surfaces, including upstand details and drain flanges. For surfaces protected by the wearing course, exposure to cleaning agents is irrelevant to the membrane.

Membriko includes in the maintenance guidance accompanying each car park installation a list of cleaning products verified as compatible with EPDM, and products to be avoided in zones where the membrane is accessible.

## Maintenance Under Traffic

One of the least discussed advantages of EPDM in car parks is the simplicity of maintenance over its service life. Unlike liquid-applied systems requiring periodic reapplication, or bituminous systems that accumulate progressive irreversible damage, EPDM beneath its protection layer remains stable and rarely requires intervention.

Membriko's recommended maintenance programme for EPDM car park installations:

**Annual visual inspection** of upstands, drain flanges, expansion joint profiles and perimeter details — the singular points are the only components that may require attention over the service life. This inspection is conducted without any disruption to car park operation and takes a trained Membriko technician two to four hours for a 1,000 m² structure.

**Quinquennial wearing course assessment.** The traffic-bearing wearing course above the EPDM deteriorates independently of the membrane. The EPDM can remain in perfect service while the wearing course has reached end of life and requires replacement — a distinct advantage. Wearing course replacement does not require membrane replacement, which is not the case with liquid-applied systems where the wearing course and waterproofing layer are combined.

**Moisture mapping for infiltration diagnosis.** Where infiltration is suspected — from visible staining on the soffit of the level below or from rising damp in localised zones — Membriko performs infrared thermographic survey or ground-penetrating radar (GPR) moisture mapping, identifying the location of the water entry without requiring wearing course removal across the entire suspected area.

**Localised repair.** When a defect is identified, repair is straightforward: targeted removal of the wearing course in the affected zone, cleaning and preparation of the EPDM, application of an EPDM patch with contact adhesive and seam tape. A 1 to 2 m² repair can be completed in a single working day without closing the car park. The repaired zone is reinstated with a compatible wearing course patch following the watertightness test confirming the repair.

## Fire Safety: DL 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008

Fire safety legislation is one of the aspects most frequently under-addressed in car park waterproofing specifications. Membriko includes SCIE compliance verification in every proposal for car park projects and provides fire classification documentation for all specified EPDM systems.

Car parks in Portugal are classified as **Utilisation Type IX — Parking** under the SCIE regulatory framework. This classification establishes:

**Risk category.** Car parks are classified into four risk categories based on the number of spaces, location (underground, above ground, rooftop) and vehicle type (light or heavy). Categories 3 and 4 (201 to 500 spaces and above 500 spaces respectively) require sprinkler systems, dedicated detection systems, and higher specification of surface reaction to fire class in escape routes.

**Reaction to fire of surfaces.** For underground car parks of 2nd category or higher, surfaces lining escape routes require a minimum fire reaction class of A2-s1, d0 or B-s2, d0. The EPDM membrane, classified as Class E under EN 13501-1, is installed beneath the protection layer and wearing course — it is not an exposed surface subject to the more demanding escape route classifications. Membriko provides EN 13501-1 fire classification certificates for all specified EPDM products with each commercial project proposal.

**Compartmentalisation.** Expansion joints between fire compartments require sealing with materials of appropriate fire resistance class. Membriko's expansion joint solutions for car parks include options with intumescent sealing material compatible with the EPDM joint profile, providing both watertightness and fire compartmentation in a single joint assembly.

**Ventilation.** Covered car parks over 100 m² require natural or mechanical ventilation designed for combustion gas evacuation. Membriko coordinates the waterproofing specification with the mechanical ventilation design to ensure that drain positions, upstand heights and penetration details are compatible with the AVAC system layout.

## Portuguese Building Regulations and Standards

Car park waterproofing in Portugal sits at the intersection of product standards, structural codes, and safety regulations. Membriko applies the complete regulatory framework consistently across all projects.

**European product standards:**
EN 13956 (NP EN 13956) is the harmonised European standard for flexible sheets for waterproofing — synthetic polymer sheets. EPDM falls within Type 3 of this standard. CE marking under the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) is mandatory for all EPDM products placed on the Portuguese market. EN 12311-2 governs tensile and elongation testing. EN 1849-2 governs thickness and mass per unit area.

**Structural standards (Eurocodes):**
EN 1991-1-1 (Eurocode 1) specifies imposed loads for car park structures. Category F (vehicles up to 30 kN gross vehicle weight): characteristic distributed load 2.5 kN/m², characteristic concentrated wheel load 10 kN. Category G (vehicles up to 160 kN GVW, for emergency access): 5.0 kN/m². EN 1992-1-1 (Eurocode 2) specifies minimum concrete cover to reinforcement by exposure class — XD3 for car park slabs exposed to chlorides.

**Portuguese regulations:**
RGEU (Decree-Law 38 382/51) Article 90 sets the minimum drainage slope for flat surfaces of occupied buildings. For car parks, Membriko applies 1.5% as the minimum, exceeding the regulatory baseline. DL 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008 govern fire safety for all building types including parking facilities (Utilisation Type IX). NP EN 13501-1 governs fire reaction classification of construction products.

**Technical approvals:**
LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) issues Documentos de Aprovação Técnica (DTA) as national technical approvals for specific systems and installation methods, supplementing CE marking with local climatic and regulatory validation. Membriko specifies only CE-marked or DTA-approved systems.

## Ventilation and Air Quality in Covered Car Parks

Car park ventilation is both a regulatory requirement and a practical condition for occupant safety and the long-term integrity of the building's mechanical and electrical installations. Membriko includes ventilation coordination in the waterproofing design process for a practical reason: waterproofing integrity and ventilation effectiveness are mutually dependent in covered structures.

In underground car parks with mechanical ventilation (required for areas exceeding 200 m² under the SCIE framework), the ventilation system creates pressure differentials between the car park interior and the exterior. These pressure differentials act on the waterproofing membrane — particularly at seams and singular points — creating suction or pressure loads that inadequate systems do not reliably resist. EPDM installed by the fully bonded method is inherently resistant to these pressure differentials because the membrane is positively adhered to the structural substrate across its entire area.

Combustion gases from vehicles — carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), volatile organic compounds — do not attack EPDM. The CO concentrations regulated for car parks (50 ppm average, 200 ppm maximum under SCIE) are far below any threshold relevant to polymer degradation.

Membriko alerts specifiers to the coordination required between floor drain positions in the waterproofing system and low-level ventilation grilles in the AVAC design: in some underground car park designs, floor drains serve simultaneously as low-pressure ventilation points. In these cases, the EPDM drain flange sealing must be compatible with the required ventilation opening specified by the mechanical engineer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does EPDM withstand direct vehicle traffic on the membrane surface?**

No — and it should not be installed for direct traffic without a protection system above it. EPDM is the watertight layer of the car park deck assembly, not the wearing surface. The correct system for car parks always includes a mechanical protection layer (glass-fibre board, lightweight concrete board, or protection concrete) and a traffic-rated wearing course (mastic asphalt, polymer concrete or resin system). The EPDM beneath this assembly has a service life of 50 or more years; the wearing course above it lasts 15 to 25 years and can be renewed without affecting the membrane. This is the correct engineering approach, and Membriko designs every car park installation to this standard.

**What is the minimum EPDM thickness for underground car parks?**

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm for underground and rooftop car parks. For protected inter-deck slabs in multi-storey car parks carrying light vehicles only, 1.5 mm is acceptable when the protection layer is installed promptly after the membrane. The 2.0 mm specification provides greater mechanical resistance during the construction phase (before the protection layer is in place), greater absolute elongation for concrete crack bridging, and a greater safety margin if a localised mechanical impact goes undetected during construction. For any car park where the waterproofing system will be inaccessible for decades once completed, investing in 2.0 mm is straightforward risk management.

**How does EPDM resist engine oil and vehicle fuels?**

Vulcanised EPDM resists intermittent contact with engine oil and fuels well — the pattern of exposure in a standard car park. Hydrocarbons cause some swelling of the elastomer (3 to 8% in prolonged total immersion; much less in point contact with drips), but this swelling is reversible and does not degrade mechanical properties below acceptable limits (minimum 85% of original values per ASTM D471). Hydrocarbons do not break EPDM polymer bonds — there is no permanent chemical degradation, only a reversible physical response. For commercial vehicle parks or fuelling stations where exposure may be more intense and continuous, Membriko evaluates the specification of a hydrocarbon-resistant EPDM grade or a dedicated chemical protection layer over the membrane.

**What happens if there is a large fuel spillage in an EPDM car park?**

For a point fuel spillage — from a couple of litres to a full vehicle tank of 40 to 60 litres — EPDM will maintain its watertightness without permanent damage. The fuel should be cleared as quickly as possible for safety reasons and to minimise localised swelling, after which the EPDM recovers its dimensions and properties. For a prolonged continuous spillage from a cracked fuel tank left unattended for hours, Membriko recommends a visual inspection of the affected zone after cleaning and, if any doubt exists, a localised watertightness test. In the large majority of cases, the membrane remains intact. Where a defect is identified, EPDM patch repair is straightforward and does not require membrane replacement over a large area.

**Does EPDM comply with fire safety requirements for car parks under DL 220/2008?**

EPDM is classified Class E under EN 13501-1 — the minimum fire reaction classification accepted for most construction products. In car parks, the EPDM membrane is installed beneath the protection layer and wearing course, meaning it is not an exposed surface subject to the more demanding escape route fire reaction classifications under the SCIE framework. Membriko provides EN 13501-1 fire classification documentation for all specified EPDM products with every commercial proposal, and coordinates with the SCIE project responsible to confirm system compliance for the specific car park category. Expansion joint fire stopping, where required by the project's compartmentalisation design, is incorporated into the Membriko joint detail specification.

**How is a fault in the EPDM membrane detected in a car park with a bituminous wearing course?**

Detection of infiltration under asphalt is one of the specific technical challenges of car park waterproofing maintenance. The methods Membriko employs are: (1) visual inspection of the soffit of the level below — efflorescence staining, damp zones and calcium carbonate deposits indicate the approximate location of infiltration from above; (2) infrared thermography — the damp membrane beneath the wearing course retains heat differently from the dry membrane, creating detectable thermal patterns visible with an infrared camera in the cooling phase after solar exposure; (3) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) — identifies sub-surface moisture zones without requiring any intervention to the wearing course. After the affected zone is located, targeted removal of the wearing course confirms and exposes the defect for repair.

**What is the difference between EPDM car park waterproofing and liquid-applied polyurethane systems?**

The principal differences are durability and thickness consistency. Liquid PU systems are applied by roller or spray, forming a film of 1 to 2 mm — but film thickness varies with application technique and surface condition, and may be below specification in zones of lower applicator attention. EPDM is produced in factory-controlled conditions to a constant, verified thickness. The second difference is service life: PU systems in trafficked applications require reapplication every 8 to 15 years; EPDM has a service life of 50 or more years. The third difference is long-term chemical resistance: PU maintains good properties when new, but thermal and UV ageing reduce its chemical resistance more rapidly than EPDM's vulcanised rubber network. For car parks designed for multi-decade service, total cost of ownership with EPDM is substantially lower than with liquid PU despite a higher initial installation cost.

**How long does EPDM installation take in a car park without disrupting operations?**

In renovation projects in operating car parks, Membriko plans installation in zones — typically 200 to 500 m² per work front — maintaining the remainder of the facility in operation. Installation productivity is 300 to 500 m² per working day in straightforward conditions, meaning a 1,000 m² car park requires three to five days of productive installation work, excluding watertightness testing and protection layer installation. For new construction, waterproofing is typically on the critical path following the structural slab: Membriko mobilises teams sized to the programme and coordinates with the main contractor to minimise the structural critical path dependency.
