# Parking Structures — EPDM Research Summary

## Context: Parking Infrastructure in Portugal

Portugal operates approximately 1.2 million formal parking spaces in structured facilities —
multi-storey car parks, underground car parks beneath residential and commercial developments,
and rooftop car parks over shopping centres and logistics hubs. The volume of structured parking
has grown consistently since the mid-1990s as urban densification in Lisbon, Porto, Braga, Coimbra
and coastal resort municipalities accelerated. The majority of Portugal's existing underground car
park stock was built between 1985 and 2010, placing the waterproofing systems installed during
that period at or beyond their design life. The replacement and rehabilitation market is therefore
substantial and growing.

Car park waterproofing represents one of the most technically demanding categories in the entire
waterproofing industry. Unlike conventional roofing, a car park deck must simultaneously:
- Resist hydrostatic pressure from above (rainfall, cleaning water) and below (groundwater for
  underground structures)
- Carry vehicular traffic loads (typically 2.5 to 5.0 kN/m² distributed load for light vehicles;
  up to 20 kN/m² for commercial vehicles and emergency access)
- Resist chemical attack from motor oils, fuel spills, de-icing agents and tyre compounds
- Accommodate substantial thermal cycling (rooftop car parks) or freeze-thaw cycles (exposed
  decks)
- Comply with fire safety legislation under DL 220/2008 (SCIE)
- Meet slope and drainage requirements under RGEU and structural codes

## EPDM Chemistry Specific to Car Park Environments

### Resistance to Petroleum Hydrocarbons

Car parks present hydrocarbon contamination from vehicle drip: engine oil, transmission fluid,
brake fluid, petrol and diesel. These substances attack many polymeric materials — particularly
PVC (which undergoes swell and plasticiser extraction) and some modified bitumens (which soften
and lose structural integrity under aromatic hydrocarbon contact).

EPDM's chemical resistance to petroleum hydrocarbons is a function of its non-polar, saturated
polymer backbone. Non-polar solvents (aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) are generally more
damaging to non-polar polymers than to polar ones — a counterintuitive fact that requires
explanation. EPDM is indeed a non-polar polymer, but its high degree of cross-linking (achieved
through sulphur vulcanisation at the ENB diene sites) substantially restricts chain mobility and
swelling. The result is moderate to good resistance to aliphatic hydrocarbons (petrol, diesel,
motor oil) with measurable but manageable swelling (typically 3-8% volume swell in prolonged
total immersion).

For car park applications, the exposure is intermittent (drip, not immersion), which is
significantly less aggressive. ASTM D471 immersion testing in reference fuel and lubricating
oils consistently shows that vulcanised EPDM retains > 85% of its mechanical properties after
extended immersion — a performance level that is adequate for car park service.

Where higher chemical resistance is required (commercial vehicle parks, fuel station forecourts),
the specification typically moves to a reinforced EPDM or a composite system with a chemical-
resistant protection layer.

### Resistance to De-icing Agents

In Portugal, rock salt (sodium chloride) is applied to road surfaces in northern and interior
mountain regions during winter. In multi-storey car parks near coastal areas, salt is tracked in
by vehicles from salted coastal roads and seawater spray. The combination of chloride ion and
moisture creates a highly corrosive environment for reinforced concrete — the reason why concrete
spalling and rebar corrosion are the defining structural failure mode in ageing Portuguese car
parks.

EPDM is chemically inert to sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride de-icing
salts. The saturated backbone does not react with chloride ions; the carbon black reinforcement
does not corrode; there are no components that are leached or extracted by brine solutions.
The primary function of EPDM in a car park deck in de-icing conditions is therefore to prevent
chloride ions from reaching the structural concrete — a function EPDM fulfils with a high factor
of safety, given its < 1% water absorption (ASTM D471) and negligible chloride ion permeability.

### Traffic-Bearing Systems Over EPDM

EPDM used in car park applications is not typically exposed directly to vehicular traffic. The
waterproofing layer is protected by a wearing course that provides the traffic surface and
mechanical protection. The standard system assembly from top to bottom is:

1. Wearing course (asphalt, resin-bound aggregate, concrete paving)
2. Protection layer (screed or board insulation)
3. EPDM waterproofing membrane (1.5 to 2.0 mm)
4. Primer on structural slab
5. Structural reinforced concrete slab

In inverted slab configurations (rooftop car parks on insulated structures), the order may
vary. The wearing course must be compatible with the EPDM — not all asphalt mix types are
compatible; in particular, asphalt laid at high temperature can soften and bond adhesive seams
if not protected. Standard practice is to install a slip layer or protection board before
asphalt placement.

For trafficked roof decks without an asphalt wearing course (pedestrian and light vehicle access),
precast concrete paving or proprietary car park deck systems with an interlayer compatible
with EPDM are used.

## Drainage Engineering in Car Parks

Drainage is a critical design parameter for car park waterproofing:

- **Minimum slope:** 1.5% to all drain points for covered car parks (greater than the 1.0%
  minimum for flat roofs under RGEU, reflecting the need for faster drainage of cleaning water
  and incidental rainfall)
- **Drain spacing:** a maximum distance of 12 to 15 metres between drains on a sloped slab is
  typical industry practice
- **Drain design:** cast-iron or stainless-steel drains with EPDM-bonded flanges; proprietary
  EPDM drain accessories eliminate the most vulnerable point of a car park waterproofing system
- **Sump drains:** drains installed in sumped recesses ensure positive drainage gradient to
  drain mouth, preventing water accumulation around drain perimeter

For underground car parks, drainage design must also account for groundwater ingress through the
slab and walls in high-water-table conditions, typically requiring a tanking specification in
addition to the car park deck waterproofing.

## Regulatory Framework for Car Parks in Portugal

### Fire Safety — DL 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008

Decree-Law 220/2008 (Regime Jurídico da Segurança Contra Incêndios em Edifícios — SCIE) and
Portaria 1532/2008 (Regulamento Técnico de SCIE) are the primary fire safety statutes governing
car parks in Portugal.

Car parks (Utilização-Tipo IX — Estacionamento) are classified by capacity:
- 1st Category: up to 20 vehicles
- 2nd Category: 21 to 200 vehicles
- 3rd Category: 201 to 500 vehicles
- 4th Category: above 500 vehicles

Key fire-related requirements for car park waterproofing:
- Reaction to fire classification of exposed surfaces: EPDM is classified E under EN 13501-1;
  for concealed applications (beneath wearing course), fire reaction of the membrane itself
  is not typically exposed to ignition
- Ventilation requirements (natural or mechanical) dictated by the car park category
- Sprinkler requirements for 3rd and 4th category underground car parks
- Fire compartmentalisation requirements at expansion joints

### Structural Loading — Eurocodes

Vehicular loading on car park decks is defined in EN 1991-1-1 (Eurocode 1 — Actions on
structures, Part 1-1: Densities, self-weight and imposed loads). Category F (car parks for
vehicles ≤ 30 kN gross vehicle weight) imposes:
- Characteristic distributed load: 2.5 kN/m²
- Concentrated load (wheel load): 10 kN on a 200 mm × 200 mm contact area

For emergency vehicle access and maintenance vehicles, Category G (up to 160 kN GVW) imposes
a characteristic load of 5.0 kN/m² distributed. The waterproofing specification must be
coordinated with structural design to confirm the slab and wearing course assembly can carry
applicable loads.

### Concrete Protection and Cover Requirements

The Eurocodes (EN 1992-1-1) specify minimum concrete cover to reinforcement based on
environmental exposure class. Car parks are classified in Exposure Class XD3 (reinforcement
corrosion induced by chlorides other than from seawater — cyclic wet and dry). The minimum
cover for XD3 in Portuguese conditions is typically 45 to 50 mm with c+∆c. Effective
waterproofing significantly reduces the effective exposure class of the concrete, potentially
allowing reduced cover — a structural cost benefit that is rarely quantified in waterproofing
procurement decisions.

## Key Technical Studies

### BRE Report BR 444 (UK — Waterproofing of Car Park Decks)

The Building Research Establishment published BR 444 as the definitive UK technical reference
for car park deck waterproofing. While a UK document, it is the most comprehensive technical
treatment of the subject in the English-language construction literature and is routinely
referenced by Portuguese and European engineers. Key findings relevant to EPDM:

- EPDM sheet systems are categorised as Type III systems (sheet membranes) in BR 444 and are
  rated as the most durable category for car park deck applications
- The report notes that correctly installed EPDM systems have demonstrated service lives
  exceeding 30 years in protected (under wearing course) car park applications
- Failure analysis in BR 444 identifies the main causes of car park waterproofing failure
  as: (1) inadequate drainage slope, (2) failure at penetrations and drains, (3) inadequate
  protection layer allowing membrane puncture during construction traffic, (4) incompatible
  wearing course application temperature
- Each of these failure modes is addressed by the Membriko installation protocol

### Concrete Society Technical Report TR 47 (UK)

Waterproofing of Concrete Structures addresses the use of sheet membranes for car park and
below-ground structures. EPDM sheet systems are identified as capable of providing watertight
performance under sustained hydrostatic head when correctly detailed at joints, penetrations
and upstands. The document specifies a minimum hydrostatic test pressure of 0.5 bar for
underground applications.

### Portuguese Concrete Institute Recommendations (FEPICOP)

The Portuguese precast concrete and construction federation acknowledges the preference for
elastomeric sheet membranes over liquid-applied systems for traffic-bearing car park decks,
citing the difficulty of achieving consistent film thickness and cure with liquid systems under
site conditions typical of Portuguese summer and winter temperature extremes.

## EPDM vs Competing Systems for Car Parks

| Criterion | EPDM | Liquid PU/PMMA | Asphalt-based | PVC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proven service life | 30-50+ years | 8-15 years | 15-25 years | 20-30 years |
| Chemical resistance (oil/fuel) | Good (intermittent) | Good | Moderate | Poor (plasticiser loss) |
| Installation conditions | Wide window | Humidity sensitive | Temperature sensitive | Temperature sensitive |
| Seam vulnerability | Minimal (tape/adhesive) | None (monolithic) | None | Heat-weld seams |
| Traffic suitability | Under protection layer | Direct traffic rated | Direct traffic | Not typically trafficked |
| Fire classification | Class E | Varies (C-D typical) | Class E-F | Class C-E |
| Repair method | Patches with adhesive | Liquid reapplication | Hot patching | Heat-weld patches |
| Recyclability | Yes | Limited | Limited | No (chlorinated) |

Note: Liquid-applied PU and PMMA systems have a legitimate advantage in complex geometries where
seamless application is achievable. Membriko evaluates each project to determine whether a sheet
or liquid approach is optimal, and in some cases specifies a hybrid: EPDM sheet for the main
field with liquid-applied detail at complex penetrations.

## Research Gap and Membriko Position

As of 2026, no peer-reviewed study specifically quantifying EPDM performance under Portuguese
car park conditions has been published. Performance data is extrapolated from UK (BR 444), US
(Roofing Alliance studies) and German (SKZ) research. The Membriko technical position is that
the conservative estimate of 30+ years under protection layer service life is well-supported
by available evidence, with conditions in most Portuguese car parks being less aggressive than
worst-case scenarios modelled in the UK and US literature.
