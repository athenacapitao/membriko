# Plaza and Podium Deck Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane — Complete Membriko Guide

## 1. Introduction: Urban Plazas in Portugal and the Waterproofing Challenge

Plaza decks and podium structures over occupied basements have become the defining typology of contemporary urban renewal in Portugal. In Lisbon, Porto, Braga, Coimbra, and virtually every medium and large city in the country, the public realm is increasingly constructed over reinforced concrete slabs that cover underground car parks, retail concourses, technical voids and basement infrastructure. The plaza that pedestrians traverse, the garden where children play, the riverside café with its terrace — in a great many cases, all of this sits over a concrete slab separating the public surface from the occupied space immediately below.

This structural configuration creates one of the most demanding — and most consequential — environments in the entire field of waterproofing. This is not a roof, where a leak manifests as a damp patch on a ceiling. This is a public plaza or garden over a car park, a commercial space, or even a residential dwelling. A failure in the waterproofing of this slab carries catastrophic consequences: water ingress to the space below, chloride-induced corrosion of reinforcement bars, progressive structural degradation, and — where the public surface above is landscaped — the requirement to strip the entire finish layer system (garden, drainage board, filter geotextile, protection layers) to access the membrane for repair. The cost of this intervention is typically five to ten times the cost of the original installation.

This is precisely why Membriko specifies EPDM membrane for all plaza and podium deck waterproofing applications. Membriko is Portugal's EPDM waterproofing specialist, based in Pombal, with installations across the country. EPDM — synthetic rubber made from ethylene, propylene and diene monomer — is the only material with the properties required to serve this environment for the 50+ years that podium slabs are designed to last: elongation of 300–450% to accommodate structural movement, intrinsic resistance to root penetration without biocidal additives, complete chemical inertness to irrigation and fertilisation products, and proven immunity to UV and atmospheric degradation.

This guide explains the technical rationale, the available systems, Membriko's installation processes, and the reasons why EPDM is the defensible choice — economically and technically — for any plaza or podium deck project in Portugal.

## 2. Why EPDM for Plaza and Podium Decks

### Elongation and Structural Movement Accommodation

Podium slabs move. They move thermally — a 30-metre concrete slab expands approximately 15–18 mm between winter minimum temperatures (-10°C in continental Portugal's interior) and summer maximum surface temperatures (70–80°C on an exposed plaza). They move under load — service vehicles, pedestrian crowding and public events impose variable loads that deflect the slab. And there are the expansion joints between adjacent structural bays, where accumulated movement over a seasonal cycle can reach 20–30 mm.

EPDM membrane has an elongation at break of 300–450%. Against the actual movements imposed by the structure — which rarely exceed 0.1–0.5% of the total span length under normal design conditions — this elongation provides a safety margin of several orders of magnitude. Competing systems with elongation of 2–5% (cementitious coatings) or 10–30% (some high-modulus liquid polyurethane membranes) operate much closer to the limits imposed by structural movement.

Membriko treats all expansion joints with prefabricated EPDM joint covers featuring a designed slack loop dimensioned for the calculated movement range. These are not mastic beads that harden over time. They are vulcanised elements from the same material family as the field membrane, designed for the specific movement amplitude of the joint, and intended to last as long as the membrane itself.

### Intrinsic Root Resistance — Without Biocides

Where trees, shrubs or lawns are present over a podium slab, root penetration is the most serious threat to membrane integrity. A root that breaches the membrane creates a continuous water ingress point that is practically impossible to locate without completely dismantling the garden system above — a process that destroys years of plant growth and costs tens of thousands of pounds in stripping and reinstatement.

The FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau) root penetration test, codified in EN 13948, is the European standard for qualifying membrane root resistance. It exposes the membrane to two aggressive species — Agropyron repens (couch grass, selected for its mechanically strong root tips) and Quercus robur (English oak, selected for the chemical aggressiveness of its root exudates) — for a minimum of 24 months under controlled growing conditions. The membrane must demonstrate zero perforations, zero root penetration and zero deformation attributable to root action.

EPDM passes this test without any biocidal additives. The three-dimensional network of carbon–carbon bonds in the vulcanised rubber creates a physical barrier that root tips cannot penetrate, and is chemically inert to all root exudates. This is a fundamental distinction from competing systems:

- **PVC membranes** require mecoprop or pendimethalin herbicides incorporated into the formulation to resist roots — biocides that migrate progressively into drainage water and raise environmental compliance questions under the EU Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC), particularly in urban plazas draining to municipal stormwater systems.
- **SBS or APP modified bitumen** has no root resistance without a separate HDPE or copper foil root barrier layer, adding installation complexity and one more potential failure interface beneath the planting.
- **Liquid polyurethane (PU) membranes** have no current FLL root resistance certification without a separate root barrier.

Membriko uses exclusively FLL-certified EPDM with EN 13948 root resistance in all landscaped plaza and roof garden applications.

### Chemical Inertness in the Planted Environment

Podium slabs with gardens are in permanent contact with water. Rainwater, irrigation water, fertiliser solutions, pesticides, fungicides, pH adjustment agents — EPDM is chemically inert to the full spectrum of agrochemicals used in ornamental landscape management. This inertness does not degrade over time: it is intrinsic to the EPDM polymer chemistry.

By contrast, plasticised PVC membranes progressively lose their plasticiser content in permanently wet environments, becoming rigid and brittle over 15–20 years. This is precisely the environment of a podium garden slab, making PVC a technically questionable choice for this application despite its lower initial cost.

### Service Life Exceeding the Renovation Cycle of the Finish Layers

An EPDM membrane installed on a podium deck has a documented service life of 50+ years (ERA 30-Year Field Study, USA; SKZ German Durability Study). This period exceeds the natural replacement cycle of all the layers above it — gardens (20–30 years), paving (20–40 years), drainage boards (25–35 years). Membriko sizes waterproofing systems to outlast the building's planning horizon. The membrane should never be the reason for an intervention to the public space above it.

## 3. Types of Plaza and Podium Applications

### Pedestrian Plaza over Basement or Car Park

The most common typology in Portuguese urban renewal. The structural concrete slab covers a car park, commercial basement or technical services void. The public surface is paving — limestone, granite, asphalt or permeable resin-bound aggregate.

Membriko specifies 1.5–2.0 mm EPDM over the slab, protected by a non-woven protection geotextile and a protection concrete screed (50–75 mm) or a support layer for paving slabs on adjustable pedestals. The system is designed for the pedestrian and service loads anticipated (5.0–7.5 kN/m² per EN 1991-1-1).

### Intensive Podium Garden

Trees, shrubs, lawn and substantial planting in deep substrate (300–1,000+ mm) over the structural slab. The dominant typology in luxury residential development, hotels, university campuses and corporate headquarters.

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm FLL-certified EPDM, followed by a protection geotextile, drainage board (20–40 mm cavity), filter geotextile, and engineered mineral garden substrate. Total saturated weight (substrate plus drainage layer plus membrane) can reach 4–8 kN/m² — structural verification is mandatory.

### Vehicular Service Deck

Areas of access for service vehicles, emergency vehicles and delivery lorries — over the same slab that covers the occupied spaces below. EPDM is not designed for direct tyre contact; Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM beneath a reinforced concrete load-distribution slab (minimum 100 mm, C25/30, with mesh reinforcement) designed for the anticipated axle loads (up to 3.5 tonnes per axle for typical service vehicles).

### Hybrid Multi-Zone Podium

The most common real-world configuration: a single continuous slab integrating pedestrian zones, planted beds, tree pits, service vehicle access routes, commercial terrace areas and service ducts. Each zone imposes different load, drainage and finish requirements — but a single continuous waterproofing membrane must serve all zones without differentiation.

This is the context in which Membriko's specialism is most valuable: the experience to design a system that accommodates all zones without discontinuity, with transitions between different finish configurations treated monolithically at the membrane level.

## 4. Load-Bearing Finishes Over EPDM — The Multi-Layer System

### Protection Layer

The EPDM membrane is never left exposed to direct loading from finish materials or construction traffic. Immediately above the membrane, Membriko installs:

- **Protection geotextile** (300–500 g/m², non-woven): mandatory in all Membriko plaza and podium installations. Protects the membrane against puncture during construction and redistributes point loads.
- **Protection concrete screed** (50–75 mm, C20/25) in vehicular zones or under heavy paving loads.
- **Rigid protection boards** (XPS or mineral fibre) in inverted configurations where thermal insulation sits above the membrane.

### Pedestrian Paving and Surface Finishes

- **Natural stone** (granite, limestone, basalt): the predominant high-quality finish in Portuguese urban plazas. Bedded in mortar or laid on adjustable pedestals over the drainage layer.
- **Ceramic and terracotta tile**: common on hotel terraces and residential podium gardens; requires movement joints in the paving at maximum 3-metre spacing to prevent thermal expansion forces being transmitted as concentrated loads to the membrane below.
- **Asphalt or permeable resin-bound aggregate**: used in service vehicle access zones.
- **Pre-cast concrete paving slabs**: heavy but self-supporting on drainage pedestals; common in large municipal plaza areas.

### Garden Substrate

- Engineered mineral substrate (not topsoil) for adequate drainage and controlled settlement.
- Depth: 100–200 mm for sedum and herbaceous perennials; 300–600 mm for shrubs; 600–1,200 mm for trees.
- Saturated weight: 1.0–1.8 kN/m² per 100 mm depth — structural verification mandatory for total imposed load calculations on the slab.

## 5. Membriko's Installation Process

### Step 1: Integrated Pre-Design Coordination

Membriko enters the design process at the outline design stage, in coordination with the structural engineer, landscape architect and MEP engineer. At this stage, the team establishes: use zones and their respective load requirements, drain and sump locations, expansion joint positions, parapet heights and zone separation edge details. The most frequent problems in plaza waterproofing installations — conflicts between drain positions and garden geometry, insufficient upstand heights, poorly located expansion joints — are eliminated at this stage rather than resolved expensively during construction.

### Step 2: Slab Survey and Preparation

Structural concrete slab inspection covering: cracks (>0.3 mm are injected with epoxy resin before membrane installation), surface laitance (removed by shot-blasting or grinding to achieve minimum pull-off strength of 0.8 N/mm² per EN 12188), and moisture content. Slopes are verified: minimum 1.5% to drains in planted zones, minimum 1.0% in paved zones. Where slopes are insufficient, Membriko specifies a sloped levelling screed prior to waterproofing.

### Step 3: Drain and Singular Point Installation

All drain points are installed and connected to the building drainage system before membrane work begins. Drain collar flanges are set at the correct height for integration with the drainage layer depth specified. Expansion joint profiles and upstand formers are positioned and fixed to the slab.

### Step 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Membriko installs large-format single EPDM sheets (up to 15.25 m wide by 61 m long) to minimise field seam count. Every seam overlap has a minimum of 75 mm and is bonded with EPDM butyl seam tape or specific contact adhesive, with 100% visual and pressure inspection of all seam lengths. Singular points — drains, pipes, parapet edges, internal corners, expansion joints — are treated with prefabricated EPDM accessories from the same product range as the field membrane. Membriko does not use exposed mastic seals at singular points on new installations.

### Step 5: Quality Assurance — Flood Test Before Cover

One hundred per cent of the installed membrane area is flood-tested before any protection layer, drainage board or substrate is placed. The test holds 50 mm of water for a minimum of 24 hours. Any drop in water level triggers investigation to locate the leak source, repair and re-test. The test result is photographically documented and included in the client handover file.

### Step 6: Protection, Drainage and Handover

Immediately after flood test sign-off, the protection geotextile is installed. Membriko coordinates with subsequent trades (drainage board installation, substrate, paving) to ensure the correct construction sequence without membrane damage. The handover pack includes: as-built membrane layout drawing showing all seam positions and singular point locations, flood test certificate, CE declarations of conformance for all installed products, and Membriko's 20-year installation warranty certificate.

## 6. Drainage Design for Multi-Level Plazas

Drainage in a multi-zone podium is an engineering discipline in its own right, inseparable from the waterproofing design. Membriko approaches drainage as an integral part of the system, not an accessory.

### Why Drainage Design Is Critical

Hydrostatic pressure above the membrane increases the risk of infiltration at seam overlaps and drain connections. Permanent substrate saturation causes root rot in planted zones. Water accumulation in the drainage system during winter creates frost heave risk in paving and at drain surrounds. Inadequate drainage capacity allows water to pond to depths that impose unplanned hydrostatic loads on the membrane.

### Multi-Layer Drainage System

Above the EPDM membrane, Membriko installs (in landscaped zones):
1. **Protection geotextile** — puncture protection barrier during and after construction
2. **Drainage layer** — moulded HDPE drainage board (8–20 mm cavity height) or expanded clay aggregate (Leca, 20–40 mm fraction) for large planted areas
3. **Filter geotextile** — prevents fine substrate particles migrating into the drainage layer and reducing hydraulic capacity
4. **Engineered mineral garden substrate** — the plant growth medium

### Multi-Level Drainage Architecture

- **Primary drains**: located at the low point of each zone, connected directly to the building drainage system. Drain flanges with compression rings bear against the EPDM membrane without interrupting waterproofing continuity.
- **Secondary overflow outlets**: perimeter overflow scuppers set 50 mm above the primary drain invert, providing flood protection in the event of primary drain blockage.
- **Tree pit drainage**: each tree pit has a dedicated drainage ring connecting the pit base to the main drainage layer, preventing waterlogging of tree roots.

### Hydraulic Design

Drainage layer capacity is calculated for the site rainfall intensity at the design return period (typically 10 years), per EN 12056-3. In Portugal, design rainfall intensity varies from 60–80 L/s/ha in the Minho to 50–70 L/s/ha in the Alentejo; intense short-duration summer storms in the Algarve can exceed 100 L/s/ha. Inadequate drainage capacity is the single most common cause of plaza waterproofing problems unrelated to membrane defects.

## 7. EPDM versus Liquid-Applied and Bituminous Systems

Membriko presents this comparison as objective technical analysis, not commercial advocacy. Each system has its appropriate context — but for plazas and podiums with planting and intensive use, the differences are materially significant.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Liquid Polyurethane | SBS/APP Bitumen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Proven service life | 50+ years field evidence | 10–20 years (recoating required) | 15–25 years |
| FLL root resistance | Intrinsic — EN 13948 certified | Not certified (separate barrier required) | Not certified (separate barrier required) |
| Expansion joint accommodation | ≥20 mm movement — prefabricated covers | Typically 5–10 mm | 10–15 mm with formed loop detail |
| Installation on occupied structures | Cold — no flame, low VOC | Cold — moderate VOC | Open flame — fire risk |
| Mid-life intervention | None required for 50+ years | Recoating at year 10–15 | Replacement at year 15–25 |
| Chemical resistance | Inert to fertilisers, pesticides, pool chemicals | May degrade with prolonged agrochemical exposure | Chemically stable; solvent risk during application |
| 30-year total cost of ownership | Lowest | Highest (recoating cost plus garden reinstatement) | High (replacement cost plus finish layer reinstatement) |

For podiums with intensive gardens: the cost of stripping the garden to recoat a liquid PU membrane at year 15 — including dismantling the substrate, drainage layer, geotextile, vegetation and reinstating all layers afterwards — is typically greater than the initial cost differential between PU and EPDM. Membriko's position: EPDM is the economically defensible choice over a 30-year horizon for any planted plaza application.

## 8. Thermal and Acoustic Considerations

### Thermal Performance

The EPDM membrane itself is thermally thin (thermal resistance < 0.1 m²K/W) — the thermal performance of the podium deck derives from the insulation layer in the build-up, not from the membrane. Membriko recommends the inverted (upside-down) configuration for plaza and podium decks:

- In the inverted configuration, the membrane is protected from extreme thermal variation (plaza surfaces can reach 70–80°C in summer) and from UV radiation.
- Thermal insulation (XPS with compressive strength ≥300 kPa to resist garden and paving loads) is installed above the protection geotextile, with the membrane working at near-constant temperature below.
- The total thermal resistance of the system depends on the specified XPS thickness — typically 80–120 mm to meet Portuguese REH/RECS requirements for accessible terraces and roofs.
- The colour and albedo of the plaza surface finish material significantly influences surface temperatures and the cooling load on the building below: light-coloured limestone paving can reduce surface temperature by 15–20°C compared with dark asphalt.

### Acoustic Performance

The EPDM membrane makes no meaningful contribution to sound attenuation through the podium slab. Acoustic performance is a function of the structural slab's mass and rigidity and the layers above it. For podiums over noise-sensitive spaces (concert halls, hotel bedrooms, conference rooms), Membriko coordinates with the acoustic consultant to specify acoustic isolation elements — high-density recycled rubber pads or mineral wool isolation boards — immediately below the membrane, with which EPDM is fully compatible.

## 10. Maintenance of EPDM-Waterproofed Plaza and Podium Decks

### What EPDM Does Not Require

An EPDM membrane installed beneath a plaza or podium finish does not require:

- **Surface coating or topcoat** — unlike liquid PU, which requires recoating at year 10–15.
- **Seam re-sealing** — EPDM-to-EPDM seam bonds do not degrade under UV exposure or thermal cycling once cured.
- **Biocidal treatment** — the membrane is unaffected by bacteria, fungi or biological organisms.

In buried plaza applications, the membrane is additionally protected from UV radiation and mechanical abrasion by the finish layers above, resulting in a service life that is likely to exceed that of surface-exposed installations.

### What Membriko Recommends (Annual Inspection)

- **Visual check of exposed upstand terminations and perimeter flashings**: the points most exposed to mechanical damage in any waterproofing system, where accidental impact from maintenance activities can cause localised damage.
- **Drain cleaning and flow rate check**: blockage by leaf litter, sediment and substrate particle migration is the primary drainage performance risk in planted plazas.
- **Expansion joint cover inspection**: prefabricated EPDM joint covers should be checked for displacement or mechanical damage at least annually.
- **Annual photographic condition report**: documentation for early detection of any developing anomaly.

Membriko offers annual maintenance contracts with photographic condition reporting and drain clearing service.

## 11. Integration with Landscaping

Plaza and podium deck waterproofing does not exist independently of the landscape design. The decisions made by the landscape architect — tree placement, planting bed depths, irrigation system routing, plant species selection — directly affect the membrane specification and drainage system. And the constraints of the waterproofing system — drainage capacity, maximum substrate depth, drain positions — condition the possibilities of the landscape design.

Membriko engages in this collaboration from the outset of the project, not as a waterproofing subcontractor delivering a membrane, but as a technical consultant to the integrated system.

**Tree pits:** For each tree pit, Membriko specifies a perimeter drainage ring connecting the pit base to the main drainage layer, preventing root waterlogging. The tree pit edge is treated with an EPDM separation detail that prevents lateral root migration into the adjacent membrane zone.

**Water features and reflecting pools:** For ornamental water elements (reflecting pools, fountains, cascades) integrated into a plaza over a structural slab, Membriko specifies the EPDM as the primary pond liner, continuous with the plaza deck waterproofing membrane. A single material, continuous across the full slab, eliminates compatibility and interface risks between a separate pond liner and the surrounding deck membrane.

**Irrigation system integration:** Irrigation supply pipes that penetrate the membrane are treated with prefabricated EPDM pipe boots — no exposed mastic is used. Membriko coordinates with the irrigation designer to establish the location and diameter of all penetrations before installation commences.

## 12. Portuguese Urban Design Context

Portugal is experiencing a period of intensive urban renewal funded by EU cohesion funds, the PRR (Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência) and private sector investment. This has generated a surge of mixed-use urban development with plaza and podium deck elements across cities of all sizes since approximately 2018.

The most common project typologies in Portugal include:

- **Riverside development plazas** in Lisbon (Parque das Nações, Alcântara, Belém waterfront) and Porto (Ribeira Sul, Afurada), where plazas over commercial and residential basements form the primary public realm surface.
- **University campus redevelopment** projects creating accessible terraces over car parks and service zones, often incorporating planted and amenity areas.
- **Residential condominium developments** on urban infill sites in which the condominium garden sits over the basement car park — now the dominant typology in new-build multi-family residential development in Portuguese city centres.
- **Hotel and hospitality developments** with roof terrace gardens over restaurants, spas or conference facilities, where the waterproofing is buried immediately beneath expensive natural stone or terracotta finish.
- **Retail parks and shopping centres** with accessible podium terraces over trading floors.

There is also a growing volume of **rehabilitation work on existing podium decks**: developments built in the 1990s and 2000s with original SBS or APP bitumen waterproofing that has reached or exceeded its design service life. Membriko carries out technical condition assessment (including drone-based infrared thermography to locate wet areas within planted zones without vegetation stripping) and proposes the appropriate rehabilitation system — EPDM overlay over prepared existing substrate, or full replacement after finish layer stripping, depending on the condition found.

## 13. Sustainability

### Material Efficiency Over the Full Lifecycle

A 50+ year EPDM membrane installed once in a podium deck versus a liquid PU system that requires recoating at year 10–15 and possibly full replacement at year 20–25 represents a 50–60% reduction in membrane material consumption over the building's life. Each recoating cycle also imposes the carbon and cost of stripping and reinstating the landscape or paving above — an impact that does not appear in the simple headline specification cost comparison.

### No Biocides in Drainage Water

EPDM's root resistance requires no herbicides. Drainage water from landscaped plazas waterproofed by Membriko is free of pesticide residues — relevant to EU Water Framework Directive compliance and to building certifications requiring responsible materials sourcing (BREEAM Mat 05, LEED v4 MR credits).

### Recyclability at End of Life

EPDM sheet membrane is 100% recyclable at end of life through established vulcanised rubber recycling processes. Recycled EPDM is used in playground surfacing, athletic tracks and road asphalt — a closed material loop that eliminates landfill disposal. For projects targeting BREEAM or LEED materials credits, Membriko can provide Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) documentation for the installed EPDM system.

### Urban Heat Island Mitigation

Planted podium decks with adequate substrate depth and vegetation support reduce surface temperatures by 15–25°C compared with exposed hard surfaces. This mitigation of urban heat island effects is measurable and increasingly quantified in Portuguese urban climate adaptation strategies. The possibility of creating intensive landscaping over podium structures — which depends entirely on the quality and longevity of the waterproofing membrane below — is a direct environmental co-benefit of specifying EPDM over systems with a shorter service life that would require mid-life garden stripping.

### Stormwater Retention

Properly designed planted plaza systems with appropriate substrate depth and drainage layer retention capacity can achieve stormwater retention rates of 50–70% for typical rainfall events, reducing peak flow in municipal drainage systems. This is a quantifiable contribution to urban stormwater management that aligns with Portuguese municipal climate adaptation programmes. Membriko dimensions drainage systems in coordination with the stormwater management requirements of each project.

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions

**What EPDM thickness is recommended for a plaza with intensive landscaping and mature trees?**

For intensive landscaping with trees, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM with EN 13948 / FLL root resistance certification. For pedestrian-only zones without planting, 1.5 mm is the standard specification. When both zones are present on the same slab, the 2.0 mm specification is applied across the full area for consistency and to provide coverage against future changes in zone use.

**How are expansion joints between two concrete structural bays treated in a plaza deck?**

Expansion joints between structural bays are the highest-risk singular point in any plaza waterproofing system. Membriko uses prefabricated EPDM expansion joint covers with a designed slack loop dimensioned for the calculated movement range — typically ±15–20 mm for Portuguese climatic conditions. The cover is bonded on both wings to the field membrane with a minimum 150 mm overlap on each side. No field-applied mastic bead seals are used.

**Does EPDM resist the irrigation and fertilisation products used in roof gardens?**

Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to the entire spectrum of agrochemicals used in ornamental landscape irrigation: fertilisers (including high-concentration NPK solutions), pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and pH adjustment agents. This chemical inertness is intrinsic to the EPDM polymer chemistry and does not degrade over time.

**What test confirms watertightness before the membrane is covered?**

Membriko performs a flood test on 100% of the installed membrane area before any protection layer, drainage board or substrate is placed above it. The test holds 50 mm of water for a minimum of 24 hours. Any drop in water level triggers investigation to identify the leak source, which is repaired and re-tested. The flood test result is documented photographically and included in the handover file.

**How long does an EPDM waterproofing membrane last in an urban plaza without maintenance?**

Field evidence from the ERA 30-Year Field Study (USA) and the SKZ German Durability Study demonstrates EPDM service life in excess of 50 years in comparable climatic conditions. In a buried plaza application — where the membrane is protected from UV radiation and direct mechanical impact by the finish layers above — the expected service life is likely to exceed that of surface-exposed applications. Membriko's 20-year installation warranty represents the guaranteed minimum; the anticipated design life corresponds to the building's planning horizon.

**Can EPDM be installed over existing bituminous waterproofing in a plaza rehabilitation project?**

Yes, subject to condition assessment of the existing substrate. Where the existing bituminous membrane remains structurally bonded and the surface is mechanically sound, EPDM can be fully adhered over the prepared existing membrane using a compatible primer. Where the existing membrane shows delamination, blistering or chemical degradation, full removal to the concrete slab is required before EPDM installation. Membriko performs a pull-off test (EN 12188) and moisture measurement before confirming the appropriate rehabilitation method.

**Is EPDM suitable for plaza decks with service vehicle traffic?**

Yes, with the appropriate protection system above the membrane. EPDM is not designed for direct tyre contact or wheel point loads. For vehicular zones, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM beneath a reinforced concrete load-distribution slab (minimum 100 mm, C25/30, with mesh reinforcement) designed for the anticipated axle loads. Loads of up to 3.5 tonnes per axle for standard service vehicles are compatible with a correctly designed system; heavier vehicles require structural engineering review of both the protection slab and the structural deck.

**What is the environmental impact of EPDM compared with liquid polyurethane membranes?**

EPDM has a lower embodied carbon per year of service life than liquid PU when the recoating cycle of PU systems is factored into the comparison. Leading EPDM manufacturers publish ISO 14025-compliant Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) quantifying embodied carbon, primary energy demand and water use. EPDM requires no biocidal additives for root resistance, contains no chlorine, and is recyclable at end of life through established vulcanised rubber recycling processes. For projects targeting BREEAM Mat 05 or LEED v4 MR credits, Membriko provides full EPD documentation for the installed system.
