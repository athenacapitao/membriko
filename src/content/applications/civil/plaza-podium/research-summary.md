# Plaza and Podium Decks — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Plaza and Podium Deck Waterproofing

Plaza decks and podium structures represent one of the most structurally and technically demanding waterproofing environments in the built environment. Unlike a conventional flat roof, a plaza or podium deck must simultaneously serve as a structural loading platform, a waterproofing substrate, a drainage distribution system, and — in the majority of contemporary urban projects — the foundation of a public or semi-public amenity space ranging from pedestrian paving to intensive roof gardens with mature trees.

The defining characteristic of this application is complexity. A standard flat roof has one zone, one finish, and one function. A plaza deck may combine, on the same continuous structural slab, zones of light vehicular traffic, pedestrian paving, ornamental planting, deep-substrate tree pits, water features, and commercial terrace seating — each imposing different mechanical, chemical and thermal loads on the waterproofing membrane immediately below. The membrane must perform without distinction across all these zones while remaining permanently buried beneath protection layers, landscaping and paving that make access for inspection or repair extremely difficult.

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) vulcanised rubber sheet membrane has established itself as the reference material for this application in demanding European projects. Its combination of exceptional elongation (300-450% at break), wide service temperature range (-45°C to +150°C), complete immunity to root penetration without biocidal additives, and resistance to the fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water present in planted environments makes it uniquely suited to the plaza and podium deck environment.

## Structural and Load-Bearing Context

Plaza decks are invariably built over occupied or semi-occupied spaces: underground car parks, retail concourses, building basements, service voids or inhabited floors. This means that any waterproofing failure produces consequences not merely to the membrane itself, but to the spaces below — water ingress to reinforced concrete causes chloride-induced rebar corrosion, progressive structural capacity loss, and repair costs that can exceed ten times the original waterproofing installation cost.

The structural slab itself undergoes thermal and live-load movement that the waterproofing membrane must accommodate without failure. A 30-metre concrete podium slab expands approximately 15-18 mm between winter minimum (-10°C inland Portugal) and summer maximum (+45°C ambient with surface temperatures reaching 70-80°C on exposed concrete). EPDM's 300-450% elongation capacity provides an enormous margin over the actual strains imposed — a fundamental advantage over cementitious or thin liquid-applied systems whose elongation is measured in single-digit percentages.

Expansion joints between adjacent structural bays concentrate accumulated thermal movement and present the highest-risk singular point in any plaza waterproofing system. Movement at these joints can reach 20-30 mm over a full seasonal cycle, and the waterproofing detail must bridge this movement indefinitely without fatigue or delamination. Prefabricated EPDM expansion joint covers — moulded from the same material as the field membrane and formed with a designed slack loop — are the only system capable of accommodating this magnitude of cyclical movement for 50+ year design lives.

## Root Penetration — The Critical Threat

Wherever tree pits, planting beds or landscaped zones are integrated into the plaza design, root penetration becomes the primary threat to membrane integrity. The consequences of root breach are severe: a single root tip penetrating the membrane creates an ongoing leak source that is virtually impossible to locate without stripping the entire planting system, at enormous disruption and cost.

The FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau) root penetration test, codified in EN 13948, is the European standard for membrane root resistance qualification. The test exposes membrane samples to two aggressive root species — Agropyron repens (couch grass, selected for its mechanical root tip strength) and Quercus robur (English oak, selected for its chemical root exudate aggressiveness) — for a minimum of 24 months in controlled growing conditions. The membrane must demonstrate zero perforation, zero root penetration and zero deformation attributable to root action.

EPDM passes EN 13948 / FLL testing without biocidal additives. The densely cross-linked thermoset rubber network provides purely mechanical root resistance: the molecular structure is physically impenetrable to root tips and chemically inert to root exudates. This is a fundamental distinction from:

- **PVC membranes** which require mecoprop or pendimethalin herbicides incorporated into the formulation to resist roots — biocides that leach progressively into drainage water and raise environmental compliance questions under the European Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC), particularly in urban plazas draining to municipal stormwater systems.
- **SBS modified bitumen** which has no root resistance at all and requires a separate HDPE or copper foil root barrier layer, adding installation complexity and a second potential failure interface beneath the planting.
- **Liquid-applied polyurethane (PU) membranes** which have no current FLL root resistance certification and are not specified for planted environments without a separate root barrier.

## Drainage System Design

Drainage design is inseparable from plaza waterproofing design. Unlike a roof, a plaza deck must manage multiple drainage inputs simultaneously: rainfall on exposed paving, irrigation water from planted zones, water from fountains or reflecting pools, and incidental spillage from commercial or hospitality uses.

The drainage architecture for a planted plaza typically follows a four-layer system above the EPDM membrane:

1. **Protection geotextile** (non-woven, 300-500 g/m²) — protects the membrane surface from puncture during construction and subsequent loading.
2. **Drainage layer** — either moulded plastic drainage board (20-40 mm cavity) or expanded clay aggregate (Leca) in planted zones. The drainage layer carries horizontal water movement to collection drains at perimeter or internal sumps.
3. **Filter geotextile** — prevents fine substrate particles from migrating into the drainage layer and reducing its hydraulic capacity over time.
4. **Planting substrate** or protection concrete — the final layer in the construction sequence, depending on the zone use.

Drain positions, sump design, and drainage board capacity must be hydraulically engineered for the specific site rainfall intensity. In Porto and northern Portugal, design rainfall intensity exceeds 100 L/s/hectare for 10-year return period events, while in the Algarve, intense but shorter duration summer storms can deliver 80-120 mm/hour. Inadequate drainage capacity allows hydrostatic pressure to build above the membrane — increasing penetration risk at seam overlaps and drain connections.

**EN 13956:2012** — Flexible sheets for waterproofing — Plastic and rubber sheets for roof waterproofing. The base product standard for EPDM sheet. Specifies minimum tensile strength (≥7.5 N/mm²), elongation at break (≥300%), cold folding resistance, tear resistance and dimensional stability. All Membriko-specified EPDM products carry CE marking under EN 13956.

**EN 13948:2007** — Flexible sheets for waterproofing — Bitumen, plastic and rubber sheets for roof waterproofing — Determination of resistance to root penetration. The European standard encoding the FLL test methodology. Required for all membranes used in landscaped applications. The two reference test species (Agropyron repens and Quercus robur) are defined in this standard with their cultivation protocols.

**FLL Dachbegrünungsrichtlinien (Green Roof Guidelines)** — The FLL guidelines, most recently updated, are the de facto European technical reference for all aspects of green roof and planted deck design including substrate depth, root barrier specification, drainage system design and irrigation requirements. Referenced by Portuguese landscape architects and engineers on specification-led projects.

**RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas) — Decree-Law 38 382/51** — Portuguese building regulations governing, among other aspects, minimum drainage slopes (1% for accessible terraces) and structural loading. In practice, the Eurocodes (EN 1990 to EN 1999) govern structural design for plaza decks.

**EN 1991-1-1 (Eurocode 1 — Actions on Structures)** — Defines characteristic loads for roofs and terraces including snow, wind and imposed loads. For accessible plazas, imposed loads of 5 kN/m² (public access, tables and chairs) or 7.5 kN/m² (areas where vehicles may be present) are typical. Substrate weight for intensive planting (300-400 mm substrate depth, saturated) adds 3-5 kN/m² to structural loading, requiring verification.

**NP EN 1337 (Structural Bearings)** and associated Eurocodes define the movement accommodation requirements at expansion joints in podium structures. These define the joint opening ranges that expansion joint waterproofing details must span.

## Competing Systems for Plaza Decks

**Liquid-applied polyurethane (PU) membranes** are widely used for plaza decks in Portugal due to their seamless application and ability to navigate complex geometries. Their principal weaknesses for this application are: no FLL root resistance certification without a separate root barrier; service life of 10-20 years requiring recoating at mid-life; significant sensitivity to surface moisture and temperature during application; and susceptibility to fatigue under dynamic loading (foot traffic, service vehicle vibration). In deep-planted zones, the cost of stripping and reinstating the planting to recoat after 15 years typically exceeds the differential cost of installing EPDM at the outset.

**APP modified bitumen sheet** (typically 4-5 mm torch-applied) is the incumbent specification on many Portuguese podium projects built in the 1990s and 2000s. At current ages, these original installations are approaching or have exceeded their design life and represent a substantial rehabilitation pipeline. APP bitumen has no root resistance without a separate HDPE root barrier, requires open-flame installation (presenting fire risk on occupied structures), and has a service life limited to 20-25 years in Portugal's UV and thermal loading environment.

**SBS modified bitumen** is more flexible than APP and more suited to the differential movement environment of podium decks, but retains the open-flame installation limitation and the root resistance limitation. Its 15-25 year service life requires mid-life replacement that, in a planted or paved plaza environment, necessitates complete strip-out of the finish layers — a cost that frequently exceeds the original installation.

**Thermoplastic PU (TPU) membranes** are an emerging competitor with good elongation and some FLL root resistance data, but lack the long-term field evidence of EPDM. No 50-year field study exists for TPU in this application.

## Portuguese Urban Design Context

Portugal's urban renewal agenda — driven by EU cohesion fund investment, municipal regeneration programmes, and the private-sector mixed-use development market — has generated a substantial volume of plaza and podium deck projects in the last decade. Projects include:

- **Riverside development plazas** in Lisbon (Parque das Nações area, Alcântara, Belém waterfront) and Porto (Ribeira Sul, Afurada) where plazas over commercial and residential basements are the primary public realm surface.
- **University campus redevelopment** projects creating accessible terraces over car parks and service zones, often with planted and amenity zones integrated.
- **Shopping centre and retail park** podium decks providing accessible rooftop terraces, car parks with planted ramps, and service yards over trading floors.
- **Hotel and hospitality** terraces over restaurant and spa facilities where the waterproofing is immediately beneath expensive finish materials (natural stone, terracotta tile, irrigated planters).
- **Residential condominium** podium gardens over basement car parks — a dominant typology in contemporary Portuguese multi-family developments in urban infill sites.

Each of these project types carries a common characteristic: the cost of waterproofing failure is massively disproportionate to the cost of the membrane itself. A 1,000 m² podium garden over a basement car park may have a waterproofing installation cost of €30,000-50,000. A waterproofing failure requiring complete garden stripping, membrane replacement and garden reinstatement may cost €150,000-250,000, excluding damage to the spaces below.

## Research and Innovation

Self-adhered EPDM systems (such as Elevate RubberGard SA) with factory-applied butyl adhesive backing are increasingly available for plaza deck applications and eliminate the adhesive spread and flash-off wait time associated with conventional solvent bonding adhesives. In complex multi-zone plaza environments where installation sequences must be coordinated with structure, drainage installation and landscaping contractors working on adjacent areas, the self-adhered system's improved installation speed and reduced sensitivity to temperature and humidity conditions is a practical advantage.

Drone-based infrared thermography for leak detection in planted plazas is an emerging inspection method. Wet insulation or saturated substrate above a membrane breach shows as a thermal anomaly relative to surrounding dry material during evening thermographic surveys, allowing non-invasive identification of leak areas in planted zones without vegetation stripping. Membriko employs this methodology for post-installation monitoring on large projects and for condition assessment of existing installations prior to rehabilitation.
