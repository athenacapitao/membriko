# Retaining Wall Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane — Complete Membriko Guide

## 1. Introduction: Why Retaining Walls Fail and How to Prevent It

A retaining wall that works correctly is invisible. It holds back the earth, protects the adjacent structure, and channels water away in a controlled fashion. A retaining wall that fails — through water infiltration, accumulated hydrostatic pressure, or the progressive chemical degradation of concrete or masonry — is one of the most costly and disruptive problems a property owner or contractor can face.

In Portugal, retaining walls without adequate waterproofing are a common reality. Gravity walls in dry-stone or mortared masonry, cantilever concrete walls without drainage, urban retaining structures built to minimum specification — the outcome is invariably the same: moisture penetrating the structure, efflorescence on the exposed face, cracks that widen with seasonal thermal and moisture cycles, and eventually water entering basements, gardens or adjacent roads.

Membriko, based in Pombal with project experience across Portugal, specifies EPDM membrane for retaining walls because EPDM is the only material that simultaneously addresses the three challenges of this application: **hydrostatic pressure resistance**, **structural crack and joint bridging**, and **durability in permanent contact with wet soil and soil acids**.

## 2. Why EPDM Is the Ideal Retaining Wall Membrane

### Structural Resistance to Hydrostatic Pressure

Hydrostatic pressure is the primary enemy of any retaining wall in a wet environment. For every metre of water column above the wall base, lateral pressure increases by 9.81 kPa. A water table at 3 m above the wall foundation imposes 29.4 kPa at the membrane base — acting continuously, every hour of every year.

EPDM is tested for watertightness to EN 1928 (Method B) at a minimum pressure of 60 kPa, equivalent to a 6 m water column. The vast majority of residential and commercial retaining structures in Portugal operate below this threshold. Membriko specifies EPDM at a minimum of 1.5 mm thickness for residential applications and 2.0 mm for engineering structures and walls above 3 m in height.

### Elongation to Bridge Cracks and Construction Joints

The second critical challenge is movement. Retaining walls are not rigid structures: they deflect under seasonal loading, develop cracks at construction joints, and accommodate differential settlement between wall sections. A rigid or semi-rigid membrane — bituminous, cementitious or rigid plastic — cracks at these points and ceases to be watertight.

Membriko's EPDM has an elongation at break of ≥ 400% (EN 12311-2). A 1.5 mm thick membrane installed over a construction joint that subsequently opens by 15 mm sustains a local elongation of approximately 100-150% at the bridge point — well below its failure strain. After the joint closes (under thermal or seasonal variation), the EPDM recovers elastically to its original dimensions without fatigue or cumulative degradation.

### Durability in Contact with Soil

The third challenge is chemical: wet soil contains humic acids (products of organic matter decomposition), sulphates (particularly in Alentejo and Ribatejo clay soils), chlorides (in coastal zones), and pH variations. A membrane in permanent contact with this environment must be chemically inert.

EPDM is a vulcanised synthetic rubber with a saturated polymer backbone — no double bonds available to react with acids, oxidising agents or alkalis. It does not undergo hydrolysis. It releases no plasticisers that would degrade its properties over time. Water absorption is below 1% by mass (ASTM D471) even after decades of immersion. This is why Membriko specifies it for any long-term buried application.

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 10 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |
| Hydrostatic watertightness | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 |
| Water absorption | < 1% by mass | ASTM D471 |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| Humic acid resistance | Excellent | — |
| Dimensional stability | < 1% | EN 1107-2 |

## 3. Retaining Wall Types: Gravity, Cantilever, Anchored, Gabion

### Gravity Walls

Gravity walls resist earth thrust through their own dead weight. Built in mass concrete, rubble stone masonry or blockwork, they are the oldest and most prevalent wall type across Portugal — from the terraced vineyards of the Douro Valley to the garden boundary walls of rural quintas throughout the country.

**Specific considerations Membriko addresses for this wall type:**
The wide base (typically 40-60% of wall height) creates a substantial horizontal surface at foundation level requiring careful detail at the base-wall face junction. Gravity walls in stone masonry present irregular surfaces that require preparation — filling of open joints and levelling of protrusions — before EPDM membrane application. Membriko specifies 1.5 mm EPDM in full adhesion, complemented by a geocomposite drainage board on the retained face.

**Typical applications in Portugal:** agricultural terracing in the Douro Demarcated Region, quinta boundary and retaining walls, garden terracing in single-family residential properties, municipal road retaining structures.

### Cantilever Walls

Reinforced concrete cantilever walls — of L or T cross-section — are the structurally efficient solution for heights above 2-3 m. The stem transfers earth thrust to the foundation slab through cantilever bending action. This is the dominant wall type in modern construction in Portugal, in both residential contexts (basement walls, garage ramps, terraces) and civil infrastructure.

**Specific considerations Membriko addresses for this wall type:**
The base-stem construction joint is the critical waterproofing detail — the stem is cast onto the already-hardened base, creating an interface where shrinkage-related cracking is nearly inevitable. Membriko treats this joint with a pre-formed EPDM accessory or a reinforcing overlap strip bonded across the junction. The base slab may be subject to hydrostatic uplift when the water table rises above the foundation level — requiring EPDM membrane on the underside of the base slab as well, mechanically anchored at the perimeter.

Membriko specifies 1.5 mm EPDM for residential cantilever walls and 2.0 mm for commercial structures and civil infrastructure.

### Anchored and Sheet Pile Walls

Anchored retaining structures — contiguous bored pile walls, pre-cast concrete panel systems or steel sheet piles tied back with ground anchors — are used in deep urban excavations where space constraints prevent wide wall bases. In Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and the coastal cities of the Algarve, this wall type is common in basement construction, underground car parks and transport infrastructure.

**Specific considerations Membriko addresses for this wall type:**
The membrane penetration at each anchor head is the most critical waterproofing detail in this wall type. Membriko uses pre-moulded EPDM penetration sleeves with flanged mechanical compression seals, which seal against the anchor and accommodate load-variation-induced anchor movement throughout the structure's service life. The irregular surface geometry resulting from alternating pile shafts and sprayed concrete (gunite) infill panels requires thorough preparation before membrane application.

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for urban sheet pile and contiguous pile walls, complemented by high-capacity geocomposite drainage board between the pile face and the membrane.

### Gabion Walls — Adjacent Applications

Gabion walls are permeable structures by design — drainage is inherent in their function. They are not waterproofed as a primary element. However, Membriko applies EPDM membrane in specific contexts adjacent to gabion structures: on the retained soil face where fine particle migration through the stone-filled baskets must be controlled, and on channel and collection basin elements integrated into the gabion drainage system. EPDM's resistance and flexibility are equally well-suited to these smaller-scale associated applications.

---

## 4. Hydrostatic Pressure and Drainage Design

### The Fundamental Rule: Drain First, Then Waterproof

Membriko applies a principle derived from sound geotechnical engineering practice: drainage is the first line of defence against hydrostatic pressure; the waterproofing membrane is the second. A retaining wall with correctly designed and installed drainage can reduce hydrostatic loading on the membrane face from several metres of water head to less than 0.5 m. The EPDM membrane then has an easier — and longer — service life.

### Drainage Systems Membriko Specifies

**Geocomposite drainage board** (preferred): non-woven geotextile bonded to a dimpled or cuspated polypropylene or polyethylene drainage core. Placed with the geotextile filter face towards the retained soil, it captures groundwater and channels it to the base of the wall, where it is collected by a perforated pipe or discharged through weep holes. The smooth core face bears gently against the EPDM membrane, providing mechanical protection against angular aggregate in the backfill.

**Granular drainage blanket**: 300-600 mm of washed gravel or crushed stone (10-20 mm size, less than 5% fines passing 0.063 mm) placed against the waterproofed wall face. A robust solution for rural projects where geocomposite is not economically justified.

**French drain at wall base**: perforated pipe in geotextile-wrapped granular surround at the base of the wall, directing drainage water to a collection chamber or outfall. This is the water outlet that completes the drainage system regardless of whether geocomposite or granular material is used above it.

Membriko designs and supplies the drainage system as an integrated element with the EPDM membrane — it is not a separate supply or a responsibility of the main contractor. The interface between drainage and waterproofing is too critical to be managed by two separate parties.

---

## 5. Membriko's 7-Step Retaining Wall Installation Process

Membriko's EPDM membrane installation on retaining walls follows a seven-step protocol, developed and refined across projects throughout Portugal.

### Step 1: Geotechnical Assessment and Diagnosis

Free technical site visit. Membriko evaluates: wall type and condition (gravity, cantilever, urban sheet pile; stone, concrete, blockwork); existing evidence of water infiltration (efflorescence, moisture staining, biological growth, visible carbonation); groundwater indicators (wet soil at excavation, springs, watermarks); site access for equipment and personnel; location of buried services in the backfill zone.

Where available, Membriko reviews existing project documentation — structural drawings, geotechnical investigation reports, soil test results. For remediation of walls already in service, the assessment includes photographic recording and systematic mapping of identified defects.

### Step 2: Waterproofing Design

Selection of EPDM thickness (1.5 or 2.0 mm), drainage system type (geocomposite, granular or combined), singular point details (construction joints, corners, pipe penetrations, anchor heads), and a cut plan minimising field seams. Coordination with the structural engineer where remediation involves changes to the structural system. Preparation of quantities schedule for final costing.

### Step 3: Surface Preparation

This stage determines the quality of the entire waterproofing system. Membriko carries out:
- Cleaning and degreasing of the wall face: removal of efflorescence deposits, biofilm, flaking paint and loose mortar
- Crack and joint repair: filling with flexible repair mortar compatible with the substrate stiffness; for active cracks, expansive polyurethane injection profiles
- Regularisation: grinding of sharp edges and protrusions above 5 mm that could puncture the membrane
- Adhesion testing: systematic percussion to identify hollow or delaminating zones requiring removal and reinstatement before membrane application

### Step 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

The EPDM membrane is applied using full-adhesion waterborne neoprene-based EPDM adhesive. Installation proceeds from wall base to coping, ensuring that any water entering from above is directed outward by the membrane lap arrangement.

Internal corners (base-to-stem) and external corners (plan geometry) are treated with pre-moulded EPDM accessories — corner failures are the primary source of leaks in any waterproofing system, and Membriko does not improvise corners. Only factory-formed accessories with calibrated geometry are used.

Field laps between membrane sheets have a minimum 50 mm overlap and are bonded with QuickSeam tape (pressure-sensitive butyl on polyethylene backing) after EPDM surface activation primer. Each lap is individually tested for bond strength before proceeding.

### Step 5: Drainage System Installation

Installation of geocomposite drainage board or granular blanket over the EPDM membrane, covering the full retained face from drainage outlet to wall coping. The geocomposite is mechanically fixed at the top with a retention profile preventing soil fines entering from above. The drainage board base connects to the French drain pipe or to weep hole outlets.

### Step 6: Singular Points

All pipe penetrations, anchor heads, structural expansion joints and transitions between wall face and floor slab are treated with pre-moulded EPDM accessories or flanged mechanical compression sleeves. Membriko does not leave any singular point without a specific engineered detail — these points account for 80% of failures in poorly executed waterproofing systems.

The wall coping termination is executed with aluminium or hot-dip galvanised steel termination bar over the EPDM membrane, sealed with polyurethane sealant, preventing rainwater entry from the top of the wall.

### Step 7: Inspection, Testing and Warranty

Before backfill placement, Membriko conducts:
- Systematic visual inspection of the entire installed membrane
- Electrical spark test on all field laps and singular points (where membrane is accessible)
- Photographic as-built record of all phases and critical details
- Installation report delivered to the client

Backfill is placed in 300 mm compacted lifts — no heavy plant within 2 m of the wall face for the first three lifts. Membriko can remain on site during the first backfill lifts to verify correct practice and repair any damage immediately, before it is buried.

The 20-year Membriko installation warranty is issued at project handover.

---

## 6. Backfill Protection — The Highest-Risk Phase

Membrane installation is the visible part of Membriko's work. The backfill phase is where many well-executed waterproofing systems are compromised — frequently by another party on site, with no coordination with the waterproofing contractor.

Membriko takes a proactive position in this phase:

**Backfill material specification**: Backfill in contact with the geocomposite drainage board must not contain angular elements above 40 mm or construction waste (broken brick, demolished concrete) that could punch through the geocomposite into the membrane. Excavated site soil can be reused if screened and free of coarse angular components.

**Compaction method**: Heavy mechanical compaction (vibrating roller, sheepsfoot compactor) is not permitted within 2 m of the wall face for the first three lifts (900 mm depth). Compaction adjacent to the wall is by hand or light vibrating plate only.

**Membriko site attendance**: For projects above 100 m² of installed membrane, Membriko provides a site supervisor during the first backfill lifts. Any damage identified at this stage is repaired immediately, before burial renders it inaccessible.

## 7. EPDM vs Bituminous, HDPE and Cementitious Systems

Membriko does not recommend EPDM because it is the only product we sell — we recommend it because, for the majority of retaining wall applications, it is technically the most appropriate material. For that recommendation to be credible, the alternatives must be assessed honestly.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | SBS Bitumen | HDPE Geomembrane | Cementitious Crystalline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 15-25 years | 30-50 years | 20-30 years (if crack-free) |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | 30-150% | 12-18% (yield strain) | 0% (rigid) |
| Construction joint bridging | Excellent | Moderate | Poor — tears at small displacements | Hairline cracks only |
| Temperature range | -45°C to +130°C | -15°C to +90°C | -50°C to +60°C | 0°C to +50°C (application) |
| Installation method | Cold adhesive — no fire risk | Torch or hot bitumen | Thermal fusion welding required | Brush/spray to clean concrete only |
| Compatibility with masonry | Excellent | Good | Limited (irregular surfaces) | Not suitable |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 175 (repairs and replacement) | 120 | 160 (remediation of bridging failures) |

**Honest assessment by system type:**

**SBS modified bitumen** is the most widely used buried waterproofing material in Portugal. For regular concrete surfaces without significant joints or movement, it is an acceptable solution. Its limitations appear at construction joints with differential movement, at sub-zero temperatures (northeastern Portugal, Serra da Estrela), and in confined spaces where torch installation creates fire risk.

**HDPE geomembranes** are the correct choice for large civil engineering containment — landfills, lagoons, irrigation canals — where surfaces are extensive, flat and accessible for thermal welding by specialist teams. For retaining walls with construction joints, irregular geometry or masonry substrates, HDPE is inappropriate due to its rigidity and the controlled-conditions requirement for thermal seaming.

**Cementitious crystalline systems** are valid for new quality concrete without wide joints, where application from the interior face (in an already-constructed basement) is the only access. Membriko does not discourage these systems in those specific conditions. For masonry walls, cracked substrates or remediation work, they are not the correct solution.

---

## 8. Earth Pressure and Membrane Design

### The Three Earth Pressure States

Membriko recognises that its technical clients — civil and geotechnical engineers, architects specifying buried structures — need a well-reasoned answer to the question: "Does the membrane resist earth pressure?"

The correct answer is: **the membrane is not a structural element — it is a hydraulic barrier.** Earth pressure (lateral thrust from soil) is resisted by the wall structure — concrete, masonry, sheet piles — not the membrane. The membrane resists hydrostatic water pressure and carries the tensile stress of bridging across cracks and joints.

The three earth pressure states relevant to retaining wall design:
- **At-rest pressure (K₀)**: the undisturbed lateral earth pressure before any wall movement; for normally consolidated soils, K₀ ≈ 0.4-0.6
- **Active pressure (Ka)**: the reduced lateral pressure mobilised when the wall moves away from the soil; active conditions develop at very small displacements (0.1-0.5% of wall height)
- **Passive pressure (Kp)**: the much higher resistance mobilised when the wall is pushed into the soil; typically relevant at the embedded wall toe or at the base slab passive zone

### Membrane Strain at Construction Joints Under Hydrostatic Pressure

The critical membrane deformation scenario is a construction joint opening under hydrostatic pressure. Membriko analyses this with the following parameters:

For a 1.5 mm EPDM membrane bonded to both sides of a 10 mm joint that subsequently opens to 20 mm:
- Local elongation at the bridge zone: approximately 100-150%
- EPDM elongation at break: ≥ 400%
- Factor of safety against membrane failure at the joint: ≥ 2.5

For walls in Portuguese seismic zone A (southern Portugal, the Algarve, the lower Tagus valley) where dynamic earth pressure increments during seismic events can reach 30-50% above static values, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for all walls above 3 m height. The additional thickness provides more material available for joint bridging and reduces peak local strain at each joint.

## 10. Maintenance

One of the most practical advantages of Membriko's EPDM membrane installed on retaining walls is the absence of mandatory periodic maintenance.

The membrane is permanently buried and protected by the geocomposite drainage board and the backfill. It is not exposed to UV radiation, traffic loads, impact loads or any accelerated degradation agent. EPDM installed on the buried face of a retaining wall in 2025 will be in equivalent service condition in 2075, provided the original installation was correctly executed.

**Exceptions and attention points:**

The wall coping and any exposed upstand at the transition between the buried and exposed wall face should be visually inspected every five years. This zone is subject to UV radiation, thermal cycling and potentially mechanical impact from cleaning equipment or vegetation. Membriko recommends any damage in this zone be addressed promptly, before it allows water infiltration into the membrane-substrate interface.

**Inspection triggers:**
- New cracking appearing on the exposed face of the wall
- Damp staining or efflorescence in a previously dry zone
- Water entering a basement or space adjacent to the wall
- Following earthquakes with nearby epicentre (magnitude ≥ 4.5 on the Richter scale)

**Repair:**
EPDM is readily repaired even decades after the original installation. The membrane retains its flexibility and surface adhesion, allowing EPDM patch bonding with adhesive and QuickSeam tape in dry or damp conditions. Membriko supplies an emergency repair kit with every completed project.

## 11. Portuguese Geotechnical Conditions

Portugal has remarkable geological diversity across a relatively compact territory. That diversity translates into very different soil conditions for retaining walls, and Membriko adapts its EPDM specification to each region.

### Northern and Central Portugal — Granitic Soils

Granite-derived soils dominate the north and centre of Portugal. They have coarse texture, good drainage in the weathered surface zone, and very low permeability in unweathered granite beneath. The water table is highly seasonal — dry in summer, very wet in winter. The granitic sand fraction is highly abrasive.

For projects in this region, Membriko specifies geocomposite drainage board with verified puncture resistance (minimum 1.5 kN per EN ISO 12236), ensuring that quartz sand grains cannot punch through the geocomposite into the membrane during backfill compaction.

### Alentejo and Ribatejo — Expansive Clays

Alentejo and Ribatejo soils include Vertisol clays with high activity — they swell significantly when saturated and shrink and crack when dry. This cyclical behaviour imposes additional movement demands on retaining walls that a rigid waterproofing system cannot accommodate.

EPDM's ≥ 400% elongation is the only waterproofing solution that follows the seasonal movement of walls in expansive soils without cracking. Membriko sizes the membrane fold allowance at construction joints according to the expected movement amplitude for the specific soil type and site conditions.

### The Algarve — Limestone, Karst and Seismicity

The Algarve combines calcareous soils with the highest seismic hazard on Portuguese territory (Seismic Zone A per Eurocode 8 and the Portuguese National Annex). Algarve limestone has generally good drainage, but presents permeability discontinuities (dolines, sinkholes) and spring zones. Seismicity demands specific attention to dynamic earth pressure increments.

Membriko specifies exclusively 2.0 mm EPDM for retaining walls in the Algarve above 2 m height, regardless of soil type. The additional thickness provides greater safety margin for joint bridging under seismic dynamic loading.

### Lisbon and Porto — Urban Environments

Lisbon and Porto frequently build on historical fill soils or on Tagus and Douro alluvium — soft soils with high water tables, sometimes artesian in the lowest-lying zones. Basement retaining walls in these environments are loaded by significant hydrostatic pressure and by traffic surcharge loads transmitted through the road pavement.

For urban projects in Lisbon and Porto, Membriko specifies: 2.0 mm EPDM in full adhesion, high-capacity geocomposite drainage board (minimum 1 l/s·m drainage flow per EN ISO 12958), and reinforced detail treatment at all construction joints and service penetrations.

---

## 12. Portuguese Regulations and Applicable Standards

The normative and regulatory framework for retaining walls in Portugal is comprehensive and binding for engineering works. Membriko understands and applies these standards in the specification of every project.

**Eurocode 7 — Geotechnical Design (NP EN 1997-1)**
The governing standard for retaining wall design in Portugal. It defines earth pressure calculation methods (GEO, STR and HYD design approaches), drainage requirements and serviceability conditions that walls must satisfy. Adequate waterproofing is a prerequisite for demonstrating that the watertightness serviceability limit states established in the design are met in construction.

**Eurocode 8 — Design for Earthquake Resistance (NP EN 1998-5)**
Regulates geotechnical design in seismic zones. The Portuguese National Annex defines the seismic zonation of the territory (Zone A — highest hazard — covers southern Portugal, including the Algarve, southern Alentejo and the Greater Lisbon area). The dynamic earth pressure increments specified in NP EN 1998-5 are an input parameter in Membriko's membrane design for affected sites.

**EN 13967 — Flexible Sheets for Waterproofing: Damp Proof Courses**
The European product standard for waterproofing of buried walls. The EPDM specified by Membriko meets all requirements of this standard.

**REBAP — Regulamento de Estruturas de Betão Armado e Pré-Esforçado**
Still applicable to existing structures in Portugal alongside the Eurocodes. Membriko consults REBAP when working on remediation of existing walls designed and built under this regulation.

**Municipal Master Plans (Planos Directores Municipais)**
Municipal master plans for Lisbon, Porto and other councils frequently establish waterproofing performance requirements for construction in flood-risk zones or areas with high water tables. Membriko provides the complete technical documentation required for licensing submissions to Câmaras Municipais.

**LNEC — Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil**
Portugal's national civil engineering laboratory issues technical approvals and specifications for construction materials. Membriko uses EPDM materials with LNEC approval or equivalent European certification wherever contractual conditions require it.

## 13. Landscaping Integration

Retaining walls are, in many Portuguese residential and quinta projects, the central organising elements of the landscape. The wine terrace of the Douro, the walled garden of the Alentejo estate, the hillside garden of the Lisbon villa — all use retaining walls as the primary structure that defines and contains outdoor space.

Membriko understands that retaining wall waterproofing cannot be treated in isolation from the landscape design. The EPDM membrane is installed on the buried face — invisible in service — while the exposed face receives the aesthetic treatment defined by the client and landscape architect.

### Integration with Traditional Portuguese Materials

Membriko's clients frequently choose a combination: **EPDM on the structural core, traditional Portuguese materials on the exposed face.** Common examples:
- Reinforced concrete wall waterproofed with EPDM on the retained face, clad externally with locally sourced schist or limestone coursing
- Concrete blockwork wall waterproofed with EPDM, finished externally with traditional white lime render
- Restored granite masonry wall with lime mortar re-pointing and EPDM membrane on the retained face

Membriko coordinates its work with the mason, main contractor and landscape architect to ensure the correct construction sequence — the EPDM membrane is always installed before any face cladding or backfill, never after.

### Channels and Integrated Water Features

Retaining walls in gardens frequently incorporate water channels, cascades or wall-mounted water features. Membriko extends the EPDM membrane from the structural wall face into the channel and collection basin elements, creating a continuous, seam-minimised system between the structural waterproofing and the decorative water feature lining.

### Planters at Wall Top or Face

Built-in stone or concrete planters at the top of retaining walls are a common feature in Portuguese garden architecture. Membriko lines the interior of these planters with EPDM, preventing irrigation water and planting soil moisture from entering the wall core and undermining the membrane on the retained face.

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions

### Which membrane is better for a retaining wall — EPDM or bitumen?

For retaining walls with construction joints, movement potential or masonry substrates, EPDM is technically superior in every relevant category. The ≥ 400% elongation of EPDM (compared to 30-150% for SBS bitumen) is decisive when wall joints open under thermal and moisture cycling. Cold adhesive installation eliminates fire risk in confined spaces. The 50+ year service life compares favourably with 15-25 years for bituminous systems. Membriko specifies EPDM as the first choice in the great majority of retaining wall waterproofing cases.

### Does drainage need to be installed behind the EPDM membrane?

Yes — always. Drainage is the first line of defence, and the EPDM membrane is the second. A retaining wall with a correctly installed geocomposite drainage board can reduce hydrostatic loading from several metres of water head to less than 0.5 m. Membriko specifies and installs the drainage system as an integrated part of the waterproofing package — they are not two separate contracts.

### Does the EPDM membrane withstand earth pressure from the backfill?

The membrane is not a structural element — it is a hydraulic barrier. Earth pressure is resisted by the wall structure. The EPDM membrane resists hydrostatic water pressure up to 60 kPa (equivalent to a 6 m water head, per EN 1928) and bridges structural cracks and joints through its ≥ 400% elongation capacity. Membriko can provide material test reports confirming these values for each batch of EPDM used on a project.

### Can EPDM waterproof an existing cracked retaining wall?

Yes. EPDM is ideal for the remediation of cracked or deteriorated retaining walls. Cracks are filled with flexible repair mortar before membrane application. If new cracks develop at the same location after waterproofing, the EPDM accommodates the movement without tearing — unlike rigid cementitious or aged bituminous systems that crack again at the same point.

### Does EPDM resist permanent contact with wet soil and soil acids?

Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to all soil environments found in Portugal: granitic soils, clays, calcareous soils, organic alluvium and urban fill. It does not undergo hydrolysis, releases no plasticisers into the soil water, and resists humic acids, sulphates and chlorides without degradation. Water absorption is below 1% by mass (ASTM D471) even after decades of permanent wet soil contact.

### What EPDM thickness does Membriko recommend for retaining walls?

Membriko specifies 1.5 mm for residential and agricultural retaining walls up to 3 m height. For commercial structures, walls above 3 m, walls in seismic zone A (southern Portugal) and walls subject to a water table more than 3 m above foundation level, the specification is 2.0 mm. For hydrostatic pressure heads above 6 m, Membriko conducts a specific engineering analysis before finalising the thickness specification.

### Can EPDM be installed on an irregular stone masonry wall?

Yes. EPDM's ≥ 400% elongation and cold-adhesive installation method allow the membrane to conform to the irregular surface geometry of stone masonry walls. Protrusions above 10 mm are ground flush or mortared in; sharp edges are rounded; the membrane is pressed into surface depressions during adhesive application. This adaptability is not available with rigid HDPE or cementitious systems.

### What warranty does Membriko provide for retaining wall waterproofing?

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty on all retaining wall waterproofing work. This warranty supplements the manufacturer's product warranty and the 5-year statutory defects liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Art. 1225) for construction contracts. The warranty certificate is delivered to the client at project handover, accompanied by a photographic as-built record and an installation report.
