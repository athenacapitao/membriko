# Retaining Walls — EPDM Waterproofing Research Summary

## The Role of EPDM in Retaining Wall Waterproofing

Retaining walls are among the most demanding waterproofing environments in civil construction. They are simultaneously structural elements under permanent earth pressure, hydraulic barriers against groundwater and surface infiltration, and thermal-mechanical systems subject to differential temperature cycling between the exposed face and the buried face. The membrane installed against the buried face must perform all three functions — resisting hydrostatic uplift and lateral water pressure, protecting the concrete or masonry from carbonation and chloride attack, and accommodating the structural movement that thermal gradients impose.

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) addresses all three simultaneously, which is why it has become the material of choice for retaining wall waterproofing in technically demanding applications across Europe.

## Hydrostatic Pressure and Retaining Wall Environments

### Pressure Mechanics

The hydrostatic pressure acting on a buried retaining wall membrane is a function of the groundwater head above the membrane surface. For every metre of water head, pressure increases by approximately 9.81 kPa (0.098 bar). Practical examples:

- Wall with groundwater table at 1 m above base: 9.81 kPa at the base
- Wall with groundwater table at 3 m above base: 29.4 kPa at the base
- Wall with groundwater table at 5 m above base: 49.1 kPa at the base

EN 1928 (Method B — hydrostatic pressure test for waterproofing membranes) tests EPDM at 60 kPa minimum — equivalent to a 6 m water head — which exceeds the hydrostatic loading of the majority of residential and light commercial retaining structures.

For deep basement retaining walls and infrastructure (road cuttings, railway embankments, bridge abutments), groundwater heads can reach 10-20 m, requiring pressure ratings up to 196 kPa. EPDM membranes at 2.0 mm and above routinely meet these requirements when specified with appropriate reinforcement and mechanical protection layers.

### Capillary Action and Osmotic Wetting

Beyond hydrostatic pressure, retaining walls in clay soils experience osmotic wetting: moisture migrates through capillary action in the soil pore structure regardless of a positive water head. This is particularly problematic in Portuguese soils derived from granite (northern and central regions) and schist (Beira and Trás-os-Montes), where fine-grained material accumulates between rock fragments and maintains permanent moisture contact with the wall.

EPDM's near-zero water vapour transmission rate (μ ≈ 35,000 per EN 1931) and water absorption below 1% by mass (ASTM D471) make it highly effective against both positive hydrostatic pressure and capillary-driven moisture migration.

## Geotechnical Context in Portugal

### Soil Classification and Water Table Behaviour

Portugal's geological diversity creates a range of retaining wall conditions:

**Granitic soils (Norte, Centro, Beiras)**: Highly variable water tables; dry in summer, saturated in winter; freeze-thaw absent but significant thermal cycling; high silica content creates abrasive conditions for membranes. Retaining walls common in terraced vineyards (Douro), quintas and rural construction.

**Argillaceous soils (Alentejo, Beira Baixa)**: Expansive clays that exert additional lateral earth pressure beyond gravitational; desiccation cracking in summer that allows rapid water infiltration during first autumn rains; significant differential movement between dry and wet seasons.

**Alluvial soils (Tagus, Douro, Guadiana valleys)**: High water tables, often artesian; fine silt and clay fractions maintain capillary moisture year-round; retaining walls for riverside infrastructure, flood defences and urban development in low-lying areas.

**Schist (Trás-os-Montes, Beira Interior, Serra da Estrela foothills)**: Highly weathered surface zones with good permeability; fresh schist below with very low permeability; groundwater concentrated at the weathered-fresh rock interface — which is frequently the founding level of retaining structures.

**Calcareous soils (Algarve, Estremadura)**: Good drainage in limestone zones; springs and seepage zones common at lithological boundaries; karst features in Algarve require particular attention to membrane detailing at geological discontinuities.

### Seismic Considerations

Portugal is one of the most seismically active countries in Western Europe, with the Algarve and southern Alentejo experiencing the highest seismic hazard (Zone A under Eurocode 8 implementation in NP EN 1998-5). Retaining walls in seismic zones experience dynamic earth pressure increments during earthquakes — typically 30-50% above static values for moderate events.

EPDM's elongation at break of ≥ 400% (EN 12311-2) and its elastic recovery properties make it the appropriate choice for retaining structures in seismic zones. Unlike bituminous membranes, which are viscoelastic and can experience permanent deformation under repeated dynamic loading, EPDM recovers elastically from the cyclic strains imposed by seismic events.

## Wall Types and Membrane Requirements

### Gravity Retaining Walls

Mass concrete or masonry walls that resist overturning and sliding through their own weight. Wall thickness is large relative to height (typically 0.4-0.6H at base). The wide base creates a broad membrane area to protect. Key considerations:
- Differential settlement between wall sections common in gravity walls on non-uniform foundations
- EPDM's elongation accommodates inter-panel movements of 10-25 mm without tearing
- Typically buried to base; full-height membrane required from footing to coping

### Cantilever Retaining Walls

Reinforced concrete walls with an L or T cross-section. The stem is designed as a cantilever from the base slab. Structurally efficient for heights above 2-3 m. Key considerations:
- Stem-to-base junction is a critical point of stress concentration and cracking
- Construction joints at the stem base require bridging details; EPDM's flexibility handles this cleanly
- Base slab is partially buried and may be subject to uplift from groundwater pressure; EPDM on the underside of the base slab requires mechanical anchoring at the edges

### Anchored (Tied-Back) Walls

Sheet pile or soldier pile walls stabilised by ground anchors (rock bolts or soil nails through the membrane plane). Used for deep excavations and space-constrained urban sites. Key considerations:
- Membrane must be penetrated at each anchor position — the most critical waterproofing detail in this wall type
- EPDM penetration sleeves and compression flanges are standard detailing; the elastomeric seal accommodates anchor movement under load variation
- Urban applications in Lisbon, Porto and coastal municipalities often use this wall type for basement construction

### Gabion and Reinforced Earth Walls

Gabion walls (wire baskets filled with stone) and mechanically stabilised earth (MSE) walls are permeable structures by design. They do not typically require waterproofing. However, where gabion walls are used as retaining elements adjacent to infrastructure (roads, railways, utilities), EPDM waterproofing is applied on the retained side to prevent fine soil migration through the gabion structure and to control drainage to specific outlet points.

## Earth Pressure and Membrane Deformation

### At-Rest, Active and Passive Pressure

Retaining walls are designed for three earth pressure states:
- **At-rest pressure (K₀)**: The lateral earth pressure in the undisturbed natural state, before any wall movement. For normally consolidated soils, K₀ ≈ 0.4-0.6.
- **Active pressure (Kₐ)**: The reduced lateral pressure that develops when the wall moves away from the soil (outward deflection). Active pressure is mobilised at very small wall movements (0.1-0.5% of wall height).
- **Passive pressure (Kₚ)**: The much higher lateral pressure that develops when the wall is pushed into the soil (e.g., at the wall base or in front of an embedded wall toe).

For membrane design, active earth pressure conditions are critical in flexible wall systems (sheet piles), while at-rest conditions govern in rigid walls (mass concrete, reinforced concrete).

### Membrane Strain Under Earth Pressure

The membrane on a retaining wall face is subject to in-plane compression from earth pressure acting against it and out-of-plane bending at any crack or joint in the wall substrate. The critical deformation scenario is a construction joint or crack opening under hydrostatic pressure: the membrane must bridge the opening without tearing.

EPDM's performance in this scenario is characterised by:
- **Elongation at break ≥ 400%**: A 1.5 mm thick EPDM membrane bridging a 10 mm wide crack opening will sustain a local elongation of approximately 50-100% at the bridging zone — well within the failure strain.
- **Elastic recovery**: EPDM recovers its original dimensions after temporary crack closure; cyclic opening and closing of construction joints (due to thermal and seasonal moisture cycles) does not cause progressive fatigue failure.
- **Tensile strength ≥ 9 N/mm²**: Adequate to resist hydrostatic pressure at the bridging zone without extrusion through the crack.

## Drainage Systems Behind Retaining Walls

Effective drainage is the most important factor in reducing hydrostatic pressure on retaining wall membranes. With correctly designed drainage, the design hydrostatic head can often be reduced from the full groundwater table depth to less than 0.5 m. This dramatically reduces membrane loading and the risk of hydrostatic uplift.

Standard drainage systems behind retaining walls:
- **Geocomposite drainage board** (200-400 g/m² geotextile bonded to a dimpled or cuspated drainage core): placed against the EPDM membrane face to capture groundwater and direct it to weep holes or a collector drain at the base. The geotextile filter prevents soil fines clogging the drainage core.
- **Granular drainage blanket**: 300-600 mm of free-draining granular fill (typically 10-20 mm gravel with less than 5% fines passing 0.063 mm) placed against the wall face before backfilling. Less precise than geocomposite but robust for rural applications.
- **French drain at wall base**: Perforated pipe in granular surround at the base of the wall, collecting drainage water and directing it to an outlet structure.

The interface between the drainage system and the EPDM membrane must be compatible: the drainage layer must not puncture or abrade the membrane. Geocomposites are preferred for this reason — the geotextile facing provides a gentle, distributed contact surface.

## EPDM vs Competing Membrane Systems for Retaining Walls

### EPDM vs SBS Modified Bitumen

SBS (Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) modified bituminous membranes are the most widely used waterproofing for buried structures in Portugal. Key comparison points:

**Temperature performance**: Bituminous membranes soften at elevated temperatures (softening point typically 100-130°C for SBS modified). On sun-exposed wall tops and copings, bitumen can flow under direct solar radiation in Portuguese summer conditions (surface temperatures to 70-80°C). EPDM is stable to 130°C continuously without flow or deformation.

**Cold temperature cracking**: Unmodified bitumen becomes brittle below 5°C; SBS modification improves this to approximately -15°C. In the Serra da Estrela and northeastern Portugal, winter temperatures regularly reach -5°C to -15°C — at the limit of SBS performance. EPDM maintains flexibility to -45°C without any compromise.

**Elongation**: SBS bitumen achieves 30-150% elongation depending on formulation; EPDM achieves 400%+. At construction joints and cracks, EPDM bridges significantly larger movements.

**Installation**: SBS requires torch application or hot-melt adhesive — creating fire risk on formwork and in confined spaces. EPDM is installed with cold adhesives — safer for confined basement and retaining wall environments.

### EPDM vs HDPE (High Density Polyethylene)

HDPE geomembranes are widely used in civil engineering containment (landfills, ponds, canals). For retaining wall applications:

**Flexibility**: HDPE has minimal elongation capacity (yield strain 12-18%) before permanent deformation. On retaining walls with movement at construction joints, HDPE tears at low joint displacements.

**Welding requirement**: HDPE seams require thermal fusion welding. Seam quality depends heavily on operator skill and ambient conditions; poor seams are the primary failure mode in HDPE geomembrane installations.

**Chemical resistance**: HDPE and EPDM have broadly comparable chemical resistance; EPDM has superior ozone resistance.

### EPDM vs Cementitious Crystalline Systems

Crystalline waterproofing (e.g., Xypex, Sika Crystallia) penetrates the concrete matrix and forms insoluble crystals in the pore structure. It is a monolithic system with no membrane layer and no seam. Advantages are simplicity of application and self-healing of hairline cracks. Key limitations:

- Cannot bridge cracks wider than 0.4-0.5 mm; construction joints without waterstops typically exceed this
- Requires sound, non-contaminated concrete substrate; fails on masonry
- Cannot be applied to gabion walls or permeable substrates
- No elongation or movement accommodation

For new reinforced concrete retaining walls without significant movement requirements, crystalline systems can be appropriate. For walls with construction joints, masonry substrates, remediation of existing walls, or movement-prone sites, EPDM is the technically correct choice.

## Market and Application Context in Portugal

Retaining walls are ubiquitous in Portugal's terrain. The country's predominantly mountainous interior and the necessity of terracing agricultural land, building roads in steep terrain, and constructing infrastructure in tight urban sites creates a very large installed base of retaining structures. Estimates suggest several hundred thousand retaining wall structures in Portugal, ranging from agricultural terracing in the Douro Valley (some dating to Roman origin, now being restored with modern membranes) to urban basement retaining walls in Lisbon and Porto.

Key market segments:
- **Residential construction**: Basement retaining walls, garden walls, terracing for sloped plots — common in the hillside suburbs of Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and in rural quinta construction
- **Road infrastructure**: IP (itinerários principais) and IC (itinerários complementares) road network construction in mountainous regions (Beiras, Trás-os-Montes); ongoing maintenance of existing structures
- **Agricultural terracing**: The Douro Demarcated Region (UNESCO World Heritage) has extensive dry-stone and mortar retaining walls for vineyard terracing, many requiring waterproofing remediation
- **Urban development**: Basement construction in cities increasingly uses membraned retaining walls to create habitable underground space
- **Railway infrastructure**: Refer network maintenance includes retaining walls along mountain corridors (Linha da Beira Baixa, Linha do Douro, Linha do Alentejo)
