# Expansion Joints — EPDM Research Summary

## Expansion Joint Engineering: Why Joints Exist and What They Must Do

Expansion joints — juntas de dilatação in Portuguese — are intentional discontinuities engineered
into buildings, bridges, pavements, and infrastructure to accommodate relative movement between
adjacent structural elements. Without them, the forces generated by thermal expansion and
contraction, seismic loading, differential foundation settlement, and long-term concrete creep and
shrinkage would generate internal stresses that crack, spall, and ultimately destroy rigid
structures.

The waterproofing of an expansion joint is categorically different from the waterproofing of a
continuous surface. A joint waterproofing system must:

1. Seal the gap against water ingress under both static and dynamic conditions
2. Accommodate the full expected movement range of the joint repeatedly and indefinitely without
   fatigue failure
3. Resist all environmental and chemical exposures encountered at the joint location
4. Maintain integrity for the design service life of the structure (typically 25-100 years)
5. Remain maintainable and, where necessary, replaceable without structural intervention

No rigid sealing material can satisfy requirement 2. This is the fundamental engineering reason
why elastomeric sealing systems — and specifically EPDM — are specified for expansion joints in
technically demanding applications.

## EPDM Material Properties Relevant to Expansion Joint Performance

### Movement Accommodation Capacity

The defining property of EPDM for expansion joint applications is elongation at break: minimum
300% for standard roofing-grade membranes (EN 12311-2), and typically 350-500% for joint-grade
formulations. Expressed as a working movement capacity with appropriate engineering safety factors,
a well-designed EPDM joint seal can accommodate ±25% of the nominal joint width continuously and
reversibly — far exceeding the ±12.5% typically specified for polysulfide sealants and ±20% for
polyurethane sealants.

For a 50 mm wide expansion joint with a nominal EPDM seal designed for ±25% movement, the seal
accommodates 12.5 mm of opening beyond the nominal gap and 12.5 mm of compression — a total
movement range of 25 mm in a 50 mm joint. This is the standard working assumption in Membriko
joint seal design.

### Thermal Performance Range

Service temperature: -45°C to +150°C continuous. This range is critical for two distinct reasons:

**Low-temperature performance:** At winter minimum temperatures in Portuguese inland regions
(recorded extremes of -15°C to -20°C in Trás-os-Montes and Beira Interior), joints are at
maximum opening (thermal contraction). The EPDM seal must be flexible and extensible at these
temperatures. The glass transition temperature of vulcanised EPDM is approximately -55°C — well
below any service temperature in Portugal. By contrast, polysulfide sealants become stiff at
temperatures below -10°C, and early-formula polyurethane sealants may crack at -15°C.

**High-temperature performance:** Bridge decks and roof expansion joints in Portuguese summer can
reach surface temperatures of 60-80°C. At these temperatures, non-vulcanised polymer sealants
may soften, creep, and permanently deform (compression set). EPDM, as a thermoset vulcanised
rubber, does not creep under static load at these temperatures and returns to its neutral dimension
when load is removed.

### Chemical and Environmental Resistance

EPDM's resistance to the environments typically encountered at expansion joint locations:

- UV radiation: intrinsic resistance via saturated carbon-carbon backbone; no photooxidative
  degradation under standard outdoor exposure
- Ozone: no surface cracking at 100 pphm concentration (EN 1844) — critical for urban bridge
  and road applications where ozone concentrations are elevated
- Water and water vapour: water absorption < 1% by weight; no hydrolysis degradation; maintains
  full mechanical properties in permanent wet contact
- De-icing salts (sodium chloride, calcium chloride): no chemical attack; critical for bridge
  and road applications in interior Portugal where road salting occurs in winter
- Bitumen compatibility: EPDM is compatible with bituminous pavement materials and sealants
  in pavement joint applications (verify with supplier for specific formulations)
- Concrete alkalinity: no attack from concrete pore solution (high pH) in contact at joint faces

## Joint Movement Calculation: Portuguese Climate Context

### Thermal Movement Data for Portugal

The primary driver of expansion joint movement in most building applications is thermal expansion
and contraction of structural materials. The linear thermal expansion coefficient for reinforced
concrete is approximately 10 × 10⁻⁶ per °C (the steel reinforcement value of 12 × 10⁻⁶ per °C
closely matches concrete, which is why bonding is effective). For structural steel: 12 × 10⁻⁶ per °C.

**Portuguese temperature range data (LNEC / IPMA climatological normals):**

Building interior and exterior temperature differential varies significantly across Portuguese
climate zones. For structural thermal movement design, the relevant parameter is the effective
temperature range of the structural element — not the air temperature range — because structural
elements exposed to solar radiation experience temperatures above ambient:

- Lisbon metropolitan area: ambient range approximately 3°C (winter minimum) to 38°C (summer
  maximum). Concrete structural elements exposed to direct solar radiation: effective range
  approximately -2°C to 65°C (dark concrete surfaces can reach 70°C in Alentejo).
- Porto and northern coastal: ambient range 1°C to 35°C. Structural effective range: -3°C to 55°C.
- Interior (Guarda, Bragança): ambient range -15°C to 40°C. Structural effective range: -18°C to 75°C.
- Algarve: ambient range 5°C to 42°C. Structural effective range: 0°C to 80°C (highly exposed
  road and bridge surfaces).

**Worked example for bridge joint in interior Portugal:**
- Bridge span: 40 metres of reinforced concrete
- Effective structural temperature range: -18°C to 65°C = 83°C range
- Thermal coefficient: 10 × 10⁻⁶ per °C
- Total thermal movement = 40,000 mm × 10 × 10⁻⁶ × 83 = 33.2 mm
- Joint with installation at mid-temperature: ±16.6 mm movement from nominal
- Required joint seal movement capacity: ±25% of a 70 mm joint accommodates ±17.5 mm — adequate

### Portuguese Seismic Context

Portugal has significant seismic hazard, particularly in the Lisbon metropolitan area (Zone 1.3
on the EN 1998-1 national annex map), the Algarve (Zone 2.3), and the Lower Tagus Valley. Seismic
joints are wider and must accommodate both thermal movement and the relative displacement between
structural elements during an earthquake — including shear movement (parallel to the joint) and
tensile movement (opening of the joint), simultaneously.

EPDM pre-formed profiles for seismic joints are designed for:
- Movement capacity: ±50% of the nominal joint width in combined opening and shear
- Rapid elastic recovery (< 5% compression set after 22 hours at 70°C per EN ISO 815-1)
- No loss of integrity under repeated movement cycles simulating seismic loading history

## Joint Types and EPDM System Formats

### Pre-Formed EPDM Joint Profiles

Pre-formed EPDM joint profiles are factory-extruded or factory-moulded shapes designed to span
a specific joint gap, anchor into the adjacent structural elements, and provide a continuous
waterproof seal capable of the required movement. Principal profile families:

**Dumbbell (centre-bulb) profiles:** The most common configuration. Two flat anchorage flanges
connected by a centre bulb that deforms to accommodate movement. The centre bulb acts as a
flexible reservoir of material — as the joint opens, the bulb extends; as the joint closes, the
bulb compresses. Available in widths suitable for joints from 20 mm to 200 mm nominal. Anchored
by being bonded and clamped into pre-formed recesses in the joint face or cast into concrete.

**Gland profiles:** Open-top profiles that are inserted into a pre-formed channel in the joint.
Used primarily in floor and pavement joints where the top surface must be flush or trafficable.
Available in versions for pedestrian and light vehicle traffic.

**Membrane-type expansion joint covers:** EPDM sheet membrane spanning the joint and bonded to
each face, with a pre-formed loop (fold reserve) of membrane at the joint centre that opens as
the joint expands. Used extensively in roof and terrace expansion joint applications where the
EPDM membrane of the waterproofing system integrates with the joint seal.

**Fire-rated joint systems:** Where expansion joints penetrate fire compartment boundaries —
particularly in commercial and residential buildings — the joint must maintain fire resistance.
Intumescent materials combined with EPDM seals are used in these applications.

### Sheet EPDM Joint Waterproofing

For roof and below-grade expansion joint waterproofing, EPDM sheet membrane is the most common
Membriko approach. The system involves:
1. EPDM sheet bonded to each side of the joint, with a 100-200 mm bond width on each face
2. An unbonded loop of EPDM (the "fold" or "accordion" detail) centred over the joint gap,
   providing movement reserve
3. Cover strip of EPDM bonded over the assembly for UV protection and secondary waterproofing
4. End terminations sealed with EPDM-compatible flashing adhesive and mechanical termination bar

This system accommodates ±25% of the loop depth as joint movement. A 50 mm deep fold reserve
accommodates ±12.5 mm movement — appropriate for building construction joints. Deeper folds
allow larger movement ranges for infrastructure applications.

## EPDM vs Competing Expansion Joint Systems: Evidence Summary

| System | Typical Movement Capacity | Service Life (Portugal) | Key Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| EPDM pre-formed profiles | ±25-50% joint width | 40-50+ years | Anchorage pull-out (not seal failure) |
| Polysulfide sealant | ±12.5% joint width | 10-20 years | UV chalking, adhesive failure at joint face |
| Polyurethane sealant | ±20% joint width | 10-20 years | UV degradation, compression set at high temp |
| Metal cover plates | ±15% (fixed hinge) | 25-40 years (mechanical) | Corrosion, thermal bridging, noise |
| Extruded PVC profiles | ±15% | 15-25 years | Plasticiser loss → brittleness → cracking |
| Neoprene profiles | ±20% | 20-30 years | Ozone cracking, UV degradation at surface |
| Cork/bitumen fillers | ±5% (non-waterproof) | 5-15 years | Compression set, water ingress from day one |

The evidence consistently supports EPDM as the highest-performing expansion joint waterproofing
material for Portuguese climate conditions: the combination of highest movement capacity, longest
service life, and resistance to the specific degradation agents present (UV, ozone, temperature
extremes, de-icing salts) makes it the engineering default for demanding joint applications.

## Retrofit and Remediation of Failed Joints

Failed expansion joint seals are a major source of water damage in existing buildings and
infrastructure in Portugal. The most common failure patterns encountered by Membriko in joint
inspection work:

1. **Polysulfide sealant adhesion failure:** The sealant has debonded from one or both joint
   faces, leaving an open gap. Visible as a crack between sealant and concrete along the joint
   edge. Often present at multiple locations along the joint but not necessarily along its full
   length — making visual inspection unreliable.

2. **Sealant cohesive failure (splitting):** The sealant itself has cracked through its body,
   typically at mid-height, as a result of movement beyond its elastic limit. Present where
   joints have been under-sealed (nominal sealant width too small for the actual movement) or
   where the sealant has aged beyond its movement capacity.

3. **Metal cover plate corrosion:** Steel or aluminium cover plates have corroded at the
   fixings or at the plate edges, lifting from the surface and allowing water beneath. In
   trafficked areas, the lifting plate becomes a trip hazard and a noise source.

4. **Pre-formed rubber profile pull-out:** The profile has been pulled from its anchor groove
   due to repeated movement exceeding the anchorage design capacity, or due to inadequate
   adhesive bonding of the anchor flange during original installation.

Remediation with EPDM sheet membrane, once the failed joint seal is removed and the joint faces
prepared, produces a durable and reliable result regardless of the original system type — provided
the underlying structural joint is sound and the movement range has been correctly reassessed.
