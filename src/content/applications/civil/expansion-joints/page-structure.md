# Expansion Joints — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Expansion joint waterproofing is a specialist sub-market within the broader EPDM applications
space. The visitors to this page are primarily engineers, architects, construction managers, and
building owners facing a specific problem: a joint that leaks, a joint that needs sealing in new
construction, or a joint in infrastructure that must be upgraded. They have a technical problem
and they need a technically credible answer.

The page must accomplish three goals simultaneously:
1. Establish Membriko as an authority on joint movement science — not merely a membrane applier
2. Explain why EPDM specifically is the correct answer for Portuguese climatic conditions
3. Convert the visitor to a consultation request by reducing the technical and commercial risk of
   choosing Membriko

The persuasion arc follows the same logic as the flagship flat-roofs page, but the content is
anchored more heavily in civil and structural engineering concepts (thermal movement, seismic
displacement, joint geometry) that distinguish this page from residential waterproofing content.
This serves both technical SEO (long-tail structural engineering search terms) and direct
conversion of the specifier audience.

Section order:
1. Stakes — why joint failure is catastrophic, not cosmetic
2. Movement science — thermal cycling in Portugal, establishing the quantitative problem
3. Why EPDM — the material answer with chemistry and data
4. Joint types — buildings, bridges, pavements, roofs
5. Movement capacity — ±25% with the engineering explanation
6. Installation techniques — membrane loop, pre-formed profiles, bonded vs clamped
7. Pre-formed EPDM joint profiles — product families and selection
8. EPDM vs alternatives — sealants, metal covers, PVC profiles
9. Design for movement — how Membriko calculates joint seal design
10. Technical specifications — properties table
11. Maintenance — long-term performance and inspection
12. Portuguese thermal cycling data — local climate evidence
13. Seismic joint requirements — Portugal-specific regulatory context
14. Retrofit of failed joints — the remediation case
15. FAQ (8 questions) — long-tail capture
16. CTA

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Create urgency around joint failure as a structural — not just waterproofing —
problem. Most joint failure content focuses on aesthetics; this page opens with the engineering
consequences.

**Content:**
- Headline: "Juntas de Dilatação: o Ponto Mais Vulnerável de Qualquer Estrutura" (PT) /
  "Expansion Joints: the Most Vulnerable Point in Any Structure" (EN)
- Sub-headline: One sentence explaining that a joint is designed to move — and that only an
  elastomeric seal can move with it
- Four stat blocks: ±25% movement capacity / -45°C to +150°C service range / 50+ year service
  life / 20-year Membriko warranty
- CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico da Junta" (PT) / "Request Joint Inspection" (EN) (primary) +
  anchor link to technical specs (secondary)
- Background: Close-up of an EPDM pre-formed joint profile installed in a concrete expansion
  joint, or a building roof joint with membrane fold detail

**Design note:** The stat block emphasising ±25% movement is the key differentiator for this
page — no other single-line metric separates EPDM from sealant competitors as clearly.

---

## Section 2: The Movement Problem — Why Joints Exist

**Purpose:** Establish the engineering rationale for expansion joints before discussing the
sealing solution. Visitors who understand the problem are more receptive to the technical solution.

**Content:**
Three movement mechanisms with quantitative examples:

1. **Thermal Expansion and Contraction (Dilatação e Contração Térmica)**
   - Reinforced concrete: thermal coefficient 10 × 10⁻⁶ per °C
   - A 30-metre concrete slab in Évora exposed to a surface temperature range of -5°C to 70°C
     (75°C range) moves 22.5 mm over its full length
   - This movement cannot be eliminated — it must be accommodated at designed joint locations
   - Without the joint, stresses accumulate until the structure cracks — and the crack is
     always in the worst possible location, not the planned one

2. **Seismic Relative Displacement (Deslocamento Sísmico Relativo)**
   - Buildings separated by a seismic joint can move independently during an earthquake
   - In Lisboa Zone 1.3, design ground acceleration of 1.5 m/s² produces inter-structure
     displacements of 20-40 mm in typical building frames
   - The joint seal must accommodate this displacement — including both opening and shear —
     without rupturing and without restricting the structural movement

3. **Differential Settlement and Creep (Assentamento Diferencial e Fluência)**
   - Long-span structures, bridges, and large building footprints experience differential
     settlement as soil consolidates under load
   - Concrete creep (progressive deformation under sustained load) adds further long-term
     relative movement between elements
   - These are slow-moving but permanent displacements that accumulate over years, requiring
     a seal with stable long-term elastic recovery properties

**Visual:** Annotated diagram showing a concrete building with expansion joint, thermal
contraction vector arrows, and EPDM seal at the joint. Callout with the 22.5 mm movement
calculation for the Évora example.

## Section 3: Why EPDM Seals Expansion Joints

**Purpose:** The material science case for EPDM — focused specifically on joint sealing properties
rather than roofing properties (the flat-roofs page covers the latter in more depth).

**Content:**

**Elongation as the defining property:**
- EPDM achieves 300-500% elongation at break — the highest of any commercial joint sealing
  material
- At a working movement capacity of ±25% joint width, the safety factor against rupture is
  approximately 8:1 — far above the 3:1 minimum required by EN structural standards
- Competing sealants (polysulfide: ±12.5%, polyurethane: ±20%) operate at lower safety margins
  and fail first at stress concentrations (adhesion boundaries, corners, penetrations)

**Elastic recovery vs permanent deformation:**
- Compression set: EPDM < 15% compression set after 22 hours at 70°C (EN ISO 815-1)
- This means EPDM returns to within 15% of its original dimension after sustained compression —
  critical for joints that cycle between full open and full closed states repeatedly
- Polysulfide sealants: compression set 25-40% at equivalent conditions; after repeated cycling
  the seal progressively loses its ability to fill the joint in the extended state

**No plasticiser depletion:**
- PVC profiles and neoprene profiles rely on plasticisers for their flexibility
- Portugal's climate (high UV, high peak temperature) accelerates plasticiser migration
- After 15-20 years, PVC and neoprene profiles can lose 20-40% of their plasticiser content,
  becoming rigid and cracking when the joint opens beyond the reduced movement capacity
- EPDM contains no plasticisers; its flexibility is inherent in the vulcanised rubber network

**Properties Table:**

| Property | Value | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% (joint grade: 400-500%) | EN 12311-2 / ASTM D412 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Working movement capacity | ±25% joint width | Engineered design |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | — |
| Compression set (70°C, 22h) | < 15% | EN ISO 815-1 |
| Ozone resistance | No cracking at 100 pphm | EN 1844 |
| Water absorption | < 1% | ASTM D471 |
| UV resistance | No degradation (intrinsic) | EN 1844 / field data |

## Section 4: Joint Types — Where EPDM Seals Are Needed

**Purpose:** Help visitors identify their specific application. Many visitors know they have a
joint problem but do not know the correct technical designation of their joint type.

**Content:** Four joint type cards:

1. **Building Expansion Joints (Juntas de Edifícios)**
   - Location: separation joints between building wings or between buildings on a shared
     plinth; horizontal joints between floor slabs in large buildings
   - Movement: primarily thermal ± settlement
   - Typical joint width: 20-80 mm
   - EPDM system: sheet membrane with fold loop for roof and basement joints; pre-formed
     profile for floor joints
   - Membriko experience: residential blocks, industrial buildings, commercial centres

2. **Bridge and Civil Infrastructure Joints (Juntas de Pontes e Infraestrutura)**
   - Location: bridge deck joints between spans; abutment-to-deck joints; road/pavement joints
     at bridge approaches
   - Movement: thermal + traffic load + seismic
   - Typical joint width: 40-200 mm
   - EPDM system: pre-formed dumbbell or membrane-type profiles; anchored mechanical systems
     for heavy traffic
   - Membriko experience: road bridges, pedestrian bridges, railway structures

3. **Pavement and Ground-Level Joints (Juntas em Pavimentos e Pisos)**
   - Location: concrete slab-on-ground expansion joints; industrial floor joints; plaza and
     external paving joints
   - Movement: thermal + live load deflection
   - Typical joint width: 15-40 mm
   - EPDM system: flush gland profiles for trafficked joints; membrane strip for non-trafficked
   - Membriko experience: warehouse floors, external plazas, car park decks

4. **Roof and Terrace Joints (Juntas em Coberturas e Terraços)**
   - Location: expansion joints in large roof areas (>25 m without joint is unusual); joints
     between roof areas at different levels; parapet junction joints
   - Movement: thermal (greatest amplitude — roof surfaces experience extreme temperatures)
   - Typical joint width: 20-50 mm
   - EPDM system: EPDM sheet membrane with pre-formed fold loop, integrated with the main
     roof waterproofing membrane
   - Membriko experience: flat roofs, accessible terraces, industrial buildings

**Visual:** Four illustrated cross-sections, one per joint type, showing the joint location,
structural context, and EPDM seal detail schematically.

## Section 5: Movement Capacity — The ±25% Standard Explained

**Purpose:** Quantify what ±25% movement capacity means in real joint scenarios. This section
gives engineers and specifiers the numbers they need to verify that EPDM meets their project
requirements.

**Content:**

**What ±25% movement capacity means:**
- A 50 mm nominal joint width with EPDM seal designed for ±25% accommodates:
  - Maximum opening: 50 + 12.5 mm = 62.5 mm joint width
  - Maximum closing: 50 - 12.5 mm = 37.5 mm joint width
  - Total movement range: 25 mm

**Comparison with competing systems:**
| System | Working Movement Capacity | Total Range (50 mm joint) |
|---|---|---|
| EPDM (Membriko standard) | ±25% joint width | 25 mm |
| Polyurethane sealant | ±20% joint width | 20 mm |
| Polysulfide sealant | ±12.5% joint width | 12.5 mm |
| Metal cover plate | ±15% (hinge limited) | 15 mm |
| PVC pre-formed profile | ±15% | 15 mm |
| Neoprene profile | ±20% | 20 mm |

**When to specify a wider joint:**
Where thermal movement calculations show a total movement demand exceeding ±25% of the current
joint width, Membriko's design process recommends either:
- Widening the joint to restore the ±25% safety margin (preferred where structurally feasible)
- Specifying a deeper membrane fold or a higher-grade pre-formed profile with greater movement
  capacity (±35-50% for seismic-grade profiles)
- Adding intermediate joints to reduce the movement demand per joint

**Visual:** Diagram of 50 mm joint in three positions with dimension callouts. Table with
colour coding showing EPDM's superiority in movement capacity column.

## Section 6: Installation Techniques

**Purpose:** Demonstrate technical depth in joint installation — a complex, skilled operation
that distinguishes Membriko from generalist applicators.

**Content:** Three installation method descriptions with technical detail:

1. **Membrane Loop Method (Método de Ansa em Membrana)**
   - EPDM sheet bonded to joint face on each side, with 100-200 mm bond width
   - Unbonded loop (fold reserve) centred over joint gap — loop depth = 2× required movement range
   - Cover strip of EPDM bonded over the assembly, unattached at the loop for freedom of movement
   - Applied to: roof joints, basement and below-grade joints, terrace joints

2. **Pre-Formed Profile Method (Método de Perfil Pré-Fabricado)**
   - Factory-extruded EPDM profile selected to match joint width and movement requirement
   - Profile anchored by adhesive bonding of flanges to prepared joint face + mechanical
     termination bar or cast-in anchor system
   - Applied to: floor joints, pavement joints, facade joints, bridge approach joints

3. **Injection-Backed Seal Method (Método de Vedação com Fundo de Junta)**
   - Compressible backer rod (polyethylene foam) inserted to provide a backing surface at
     controlled depth
   - EPDM joint cover membrane bonded to the face on each side, spanning the backer rod
   - Applied to: variable-width joints, existing joints with irregular face geometry,
     remediation of failed polysulfide or polyurethane seals

**All methods — Membriko quality controls:**
- Joint face preparation: blast cleaning or grinding to achieve a sound, dust-free surface
  with minimum 0.5 N/mm² pull-off strength
- Primer application: EPDM-compatible primer to all joint faces before adhesive or profile
  anchor bonding
- Movement test: physical movement simulation before ballast or cover material is placed,
  to verify the installed seal can accommodate the full design movement range without tearing
- Documentation: photographic record of each joint section before and after installation

**Visual:** Illustrated cross-sections of each installation method with annotated components
and movement direction arrows.

## Section 7: Pre-Formed EPDM Joint Profiles

**Purpose:** Educate visitors on the product families available — this is specialist content that
establishes credibility with engineers and specifiers who may have specified profiles before but
not with EPDM.

**Content:**

**Profile family overview:**

1. **Centre-Bulb (Dumbbell) Profiles**
   - Standard: 20-100 mm joint width range
   - Compression set < 15%; service life 40+ years
   - Suitable for horizontal joints (roof, terrace, basement slab)
   - Anchored by: bonded flange + mechanical termination bar

2. **Gland Profiles (Trafficable)**
   - Installed flush with finished floor surface
   - Top surface rated for pedestrian and light vehicle traffic
   - Available in aluminium-framed versions for heavy vehicle loading
   - Suitable for: car park decks, external plazas, commercial floor joints

3. **Waterstop Profiles (Below Grade)**
   - Cast into concrete during pour — embedded in the joint face
   - Provides a waterstop function by extending into both concrete elements
   - Used in: basements, tunnels, swimming pool base slabs, retaining walls
   - Special formulation for compatibility with concrete alkalinity over 50+ year service

4. **Seismic Grade Profiles**
   - Movement capacity: ±35-50% joint width (vs ±25% for standard profiles)
   - Simultaneous accommodation of opening + shear + rotation
   - Specified for: Lisbon metropolitan area structures, Algarve coastal structures,
     structures in ANSR seismic zones 1 and 2

**Selection guidance table:**
| Application | Profile Type | Membriko Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Roof expansion joint | Centre-bulb or membrane loop | ±25% movement, EPDM cover strip |
| Accessible terrace joint | Trafficable gland or centre-bulb | ±25%, flush finish |
| Basement/below-grade joint | Waterstop or bonded membrane | ±20% with pressure resistance |
| Bridge joint — light traffic | Centre-bulb + mechanical anchor | ±30% movement |
| Seismic-critical joint | Seismic grade profile | ±40-50%, combined loading |

## Section 8: EPDM vs Alternatives

**Purpose:** Objective comparison framed as engineering guidance, not competitive attack.

**Content:** Comparison table — 7 rows × 6 columns

| Feature | EPDM | Polysulfide | Polyurethane | Metal Cover | PVC Profile | Neoprene |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Working movement | ±25% | ±12.5% | ±20% | ±15% | ±15% | ±20% |
| Service life (PT) | 50+ years | 10-20 years | 10-20 years | 25-40 years | 15-25 years | 20-30 years |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic | Chalks — re-seal | Degrades | N/A | Requires stabiliser | Poor surface |
| Low-temp flexibility | -45°C | Stiffens < -10°C | Stiffens < -15°C | Noise in cold | Stiffens < -5°C | OK to -30°C |
| Plasticiser risk | None | None | Partial | N/A | Yes — migrates | Yes — migrates |
| Maintainability | Inspect + patch | Full removal | Full removal | Mechanical repair | Full removal | Partial patch |
| Seismic capability | Yes (special grade) | No | Limited | Limited | No | Limited |

Below table: honest paragraph noting that metal cover plates remain the engineering standard for
heavy vehicle bridge expansion joints where EPDM profiles are not rated for the axle loads; and
that polysulfide sealant remains cost-effective for low-movement (<±12.5%) facade joints in
sheltered locations. Credibility over competition.

## Section 9: Design for Movement — Membriko's Engineering Approach

**Purpose:** Explain the calculation-led design process that distinguishes Membriko from
applicators who install generic joint seals without movement verification.

**Content:**

**Membriko joint design process (five steps):**

1. **Movement demand assessment:** thermal movement calculation based on structural material,
   element length, and local climate data; seismic displacement demand from NP EN 1998-1 national
   annex; settlement assessment from geotechnical data where available

2. **Joint geometry verification:** confirm as-built joint width against design; measure existing
   joint width at multiple points to identify any taper or non-uniformity; assess joint face
   condition and any evidence of existing seal debris or damage

3. **System selection:** based on movement demand, joint width, accessibility, loading conditions,
   and existing substrate; product selection from Membriko's approved system list (all products
   hold CE marking or LNEC approval)

4. **Detailing at corners and intersections:** the most common joint failure point is the
   change in direction — corner pieces, T-junctions, and changes in joint plane. Membriko uses
   factory-moulded EPDM corner and intersection pieces, not field-cut approximations, at all
   non-linear joint sections

5. **Installation verification:** physical movement simulation after installation; photographic
   as-built documentation; seal test by ponding (for horizontal joints) or pressurised water
   test for below-grade applications before backfill

## Section 10: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Single reference table for engineers, architects, and QA teams to verify compliance
with project specifications.

**Content:**

**EPDM Joint Membrane — Standard Properties:**

| Property | Standard Grade | Joint/Seismic Grade | Test Standard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thickness | 1.2 / 1.5 / 2.0 mm | 2.0 / 3.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Working movement capacity | ±25% joint width | ±35-50% joint width | Engineered |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | -45°C to +150°C | — |
| Compression set (70°C, 22h) | < 15% | < 10% | EN ISO 815-1 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 30 N/mm | ≥ 40 N/mm | EN 12310-1 |
| Ozone resistance | No crack at 100 pphm | No crack at 100 pphm | EN 1844 |
| Water absorption | < 1% | < 1% | ASTM D471 |
| Fire reaction class | Class E | Class E | EN 13501-1 |
| Product standard | EN 13956 | EN 13956 | — |

## Section 11: Maintenance and Long-Term Performance

**Purpose:** Differentiate EPDM from sealant alternatives on the maintenance cost argument.

**Content:**
- Annual visual inspection: check for displacement, puncture, UV chalking, and debris
  accumulation at the joint. No special equipment required.
- Periodic (5-year) inspection: physical movement test, adhesion check at membrane-to-substrate
  bond line, compression set assessment
- Repair methodology: EPDM joint seals can be repaired by patch bonding with EPDM sheet and
  seam tape without full removal — a major advantage over sealant systems that require complete
  removal and reapplication
- Comparison: polysulfide and polyurethane sealants typically require complete removal and
  reapplication at 10-20 year intervals; EPDM maintains its properties throughout its service
  life and can be patched at isolated damage points without disturbing the intact system

---

## Section 12: Portuguese Thermal Cycling Data

**Purpose:** Local climate evidence — establish that Membriko has calibrated its designs to
Portuguese climate data, not generic European guidance.

**Content:**
- Climate zone thermal ranges: table with Lisbon, Porto, Évora, Faro, Guarda — ambient minimum,
  ambient maximum, structural surface minimum (estimated), structural surface maximum (estimated)
- Movement calculation examples for each zone: a 30-metre concrete element in each zone, showing
  total thermal movement range and the resultant joint seal requirement
- Key insight: interior continental Portugal (Guarda, Bragança) has the largest thermal range
  and therefore the largest joint movement demand — often 60% greater than equivalent structures
  in coastal Lisbon. Joint seals designed for coastal conditions will be inadequate in interior
  Portugal.
- IPMA data citation: 30-year climatological normals for Portuguese climate stations

---

## Section 13: Seismic Joint Requirements

**Purpose:** Portugal-specific regulatory context for seismic joints — establishes Membriko as
the authoritative Portuguese EPDM specifier for seismically demanding applications.

**Content:**
- NP EN 1998-1 seismic zones: Zone 1 (high hazard, Lisbon metropolitan and Alentejo coast),
  Zone 2 (Algarve), Zone 3 and below (northern Portugal, Beiras)
- Seismic joint width requirements: joints must be wide enough to prevent pounding between
  adjacent structures; the joint seal must accommodate the design displacement without restricting
  structural movement
- EPDM for seismic joints: seismic-grade EPDM profiles with ±40-50% movement capacity and
  simultaneous opening + shear capability are the engineered solution for Zone 1 and Zone 2
  structures
- Lisbon case study context: structures in the Baixa Pombalina area, many of which have
  expansion joints of uncertain condition, represent a significant remediation market where
  EPDM upgrading is the appropriate engineering response

---

## Section 14: Retrofit of Failed Joints

**Purpose:** Address the renovation market directly — a significant portion of expansion joint
work involves remediation of failed existing seals.

**Content:**
- Most common failure patterns encountered by Membriko (polysulfide adhesion failure, metal
  cover plate corrosion, PVC profile brittleness)
- Membriko retrofit protocol: investigation → existing seal removal → joint face preparation →
  design verification (confirm the actual movement demand has not changed since original design)
  → EPDM installation → testing → documentation
- Note on joint width modification: where the existing joint is too narrow for the actual
  movement range (a common finding in older buildings), Membriko includes this in the design
  report with options for joint widening or movement redistribution
