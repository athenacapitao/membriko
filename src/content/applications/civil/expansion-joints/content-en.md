# Expansion Joint Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## The Most Vulnerable Point in Any Structure

There is a quiet paradox at the heart of Portuguese construction engineering: expansion joints were designed to protect structures — and they are frequently the point through which water enters. An expansion joint is an intentional structural discontinuity. It allows buildings, bridges, roofs, and pavements to move — expanding in heat, contracting in cold, responding to earthquakes, adapting to ground settlement — without accumulating the internal stresses that would crack concrete, split masonry, or distort steelwork.

But an open joint is a joint that admits water. And the majority of sealing systems installed across Portugal — polysulphide sealants, PVC profiles, metal cover plates — were not designed to follow movement over decades. They were designed to seal for a few years, stiffening and fracturing and debonding as repeated movement gradually destroys them.

Membriko works with EPDM membrane because it is the only material that combines the three fundamental properties that an expansion joint truly demands: indefinitely reversible movement accommodation, intrinsic chemical resistance, and a service life measured in decades rather than years. Our base in Pombal, at the geographical centre of Portugal, allows us to serve the entire mainland territory — from building expansion joints in the Greater Lisbon area to bridge joints in the river valleys of the interior northeast.

This document sets out the engineering of expansion joints, the data that supports the selection of EPDM, the installation techniques that Membriko applies, and the specific challenges of the Portuguese climate that make material selection more critical here than anywhere else in Western Europe.

## The Science of Movement: Why Expansion Joints Exist

To understand why expansion joint sealing is so technically demanding, it is first necessary to understand the magnitude of the movement these joints must accommodate. The movement is not theoretical. It is physical, measurable, and inevitable.

### Thermal Expansion and Contraction

Reinforced concrete has a linear thermal expansion coefficient of approximately 10 × 10⁻⁶ per degree Celsius. In practice, a 30-metre concrete slab exposed to an effective surface temperature range of 75°C — values entirely realistic in Portugal, as we discuss in the section on climate data — moves 22.5 millimetres along its full length.

Those 22.5 millimetres are not an anomaly. They are the normal physical response of the material to a normal thermal cycle. Without expansion joints, these stresses accumulate at the weakest points in the structure — not where it would be convenient for them to accumulate, but where construction is least uniform: a pour joint, the edge of a window opening, a change in cross-section. The structure cracks when and where the tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete. With correctly spaced and correctly sealed expansion joints, movement is accommodated in a controlled manner without damage.

The joint seal must follow this movement — opening as the joint expands during cold contraction and compressing as the joint closes during thermal expansion — indefinitely, for decades, without losing its waterproofing capability. This is the fundamental requirement. Any sealant that becomes rigid over time, that loses adhesion to the substrate, or that fractures under cyclic stress, will fail. It is only a question of when.

### Seismic Relative Displacement

Portugal has one of the highest seismic hazards in Western Europe. The Greater Lisbon area, the Lower Tagus Valley, and the Algarve all lie within zones of reference seismic acceleration that require buildings to be designed to accommodate significant relative displacements between adjacent structural elements. Eurocode 8, in its Portuguese national annex (NP EN 1998-1), defines the design accelerations for each zone of the territory.

For a building with a seismic joint in Lisbon Seismic Zone 1.3, the relative displacement between the two parts of the building during a design earthquake can reach 30 to 50 millimetres, combining opening movement (tension) and shear movement (translation parallel to the joint plane) simultaneously. The joint seal must accommodate this displacement — under dynamic loading, in an emergency condition — without tearing and without restricting the structural movement that is protecting the building from collapse.

Rigid or semi-rigid sealants are inadequate for seismic joints. Not because they resist the movement — they rarely have sufficient strength for that — but because they fracture during the earthquake and leave the joint permanently open after the event. EPDM, by contrast, accommodates the seismic displacement and returns to its nominal dimension after the earthquake, maintaining the waterproofing seal in working condition.

### Differential Settlement and Concrete Creep

Large structures — residential blocks on extensive foundations, long-span bridges, industrial halls on variable ground — are subject to differential settlement as the soil consolidates under the permanent load of the structure. This settlement is slow, progressive, and can continue for years or decades after construction is complete. Concrete creep — the gradual deformation under sustained load — adds a further long-term movement component.

Expansion joint sealing in large buildings must be designed not only for the annual thermal cycle, but for the accumulation of differential settlement over the structure's service life. Membriko incorporates this component in joint seal design calculations, routinely requesting geotechnical data or settlement estimates from the structural or geotechnical engineer when they are available.

## Why EPDM Is the Engineering Answer

Sealing expansion joints with non-elastomeric materials is a temporary solution. The evidence is unambiguous: polysulphide and polyurethane sealants have service lives of 10 to 20 years under Portuguese climatic conditions. Plasticised PVC profiles lose their plasticisers through migration over time, becoming brittle. Metal cover plates corrode, vibrate, and have movement capacities limited by the geometry of their hinge mechanisms.

Membriko specifies EPDM because the data supports the choice, and because the degradation mechanisms that destroy the alternatives do not exist in EPDM.

### Elongation: The Defining Parameter

Elongation at break is the physical property that determines the movement capacity of a joint sealant. Vulcanised EPDM achieves 300 to 500% elongation at break, depending on the grade of formulation. Applying appropriate engineering safety factors, this translates into a working movement capacity of ±25% of the nominal joint width — the highest of any commercial joint sealing system.

By comparison: polysulphide sealants work at ±12.5% of joint width; polyurethane sealants at ±20%; neoprene profiles at ±20%; PVC profiles at ±15%. For a 50 mm wide joint:

- EPDM (Membriko standard): accommodates ±12.5 mm of movement — total amplitude 25 mm
- Polyurethane: accommodates ±10 mm — total amplitude 20 mm
- Polysulphide: accommodates ±6.25 mm — total amplitude 12.5 mm

This difference is not academic. An expansion joint in a building in the Portuguese interior — where the effective temperature range of the structure can exceed 80°C — may require 20 to 25 mm of movement in a 30-metre element. A polysulphide sealant installed in this joint is underspecified by a factor of two. EPDM is the only membrane-type sealing system that accommodates this movement with adequate safety margin.

### Elastic Recovery: The Compression Set Test

The movement capacity of a joint seal is not merely an instantaneous property — it is a property that must be maintained across decades of cycling. The parameter that measures this is compression set: the permanent deformation that a material retains after having been compressed for a defined period.

For EPDM, compression set after 22 hours at 70°C is less than 15% (EN ISO 815-1). This means that after complete compression under high-temperature conditions — simulating maximum joint closure on a hot summer day — EPDM recovers to more than 85% of its original dimension. For polysulphide sealants under the same conditions, compression set is 25 to 40%. After 20 years of opening and closing cycles, the polysulphide sealant no longer fills the gap in the maximum-open position — the joint is open.

### No Plasticisers: The Structural Advantage of EPDM

EPDM contains no plasticisers. Its flexibility is an intrinsic property of the vulcanised rubber network — not an additive that can be incorporated in the factory and removed by the environment over time. This distinction is critical for longevity under Portuguese climate conditions.

PVC and neoprene profiles depend on plasticisers to achieve the flexibility needed at operational temperatures. At surface temperatures of 60 to 80°C — normal values for joints on roofs and exposed pavements in the Portuguese summer — plasticiser migration accelerates. In high UV environments, the process is faster still. After 15 to 20 years, PVC and neoprene profiles may have lost 20 to 40% of their plasticiser content, becoming rigid and incapable of following joint movement.

EPDM maintains its flexibility throughout its service life because there is no plasticiser to lose. Membriko has specified EPDM membrane in climatic conditions equivalent to Portugal for over 30 years, and field sample test data confirms that mechanical properties remain within EN 13956 requirements after three decades of service.

### Chemical Resistance to Joint Environments

Expansion joints in infrastructure contexts are exposed to specific chemical agents that conventional sealing materials do not tolerate well:

**De-icing salts:** in the inland regions of Portugal — Trás-os-Montes, Beira Alta, Serra da Estrela — pavements and bridges are treated with sodium chloride and calcium chloride during ice events. These salts concentrate at joints through preferential drainage. EPDM is chemically inert to chloride solutions at all concentrations relevant to road de-icing. Polysulphide sealants can suffer chemical attack from concentrated chloride ions over time.

**Effluents and contaminated groundwater:** in joints in drainage structures, viaducts over watercourses, or structures in contact with contaminated soils, EPDM maintains chemical resistance to the vast majority of typical effluents. Resistance to specific contaminants must be verified with the manufacturer prior to specification.

**Concrete alkalinity:** the pore solution in concrete has a pH of 12 to 13. Many polymeric sealing materials undergo alkaline hydrolysis when in prolonged contact with wet concrete. EPDM is stable at high pH, maintaining adhesion and mechanical properties in permanent wet contact with concrete.

## Joint Types: Where EPDM Seals Are Needed

Membriko executes expansion joint waterproofing in four application categories, each with specific technical requirements.

### Building Expansion Joints

Large buildings — residential blocks longer than 40 metres, commercial buildings with L-shaped or U-shaped plans, structures with a transition between different foundation types — require vertical expansion joints that separate the structure into independent blocks. In plan, these joints traverse the building from foundation to roof, passing through floors, walls, and inevitably through the waterproofing element: the roof.

At roof level, the expansion joint is the most vulnerable point of the entire waterproofing system. Typical joint widths are 20 to 50 mm; movement is predominantly thermal, with a differential settlement component in large buildings or those with mixed foundation types. Membriko seals these joints with EPDM membrane in a loop configuration — a fold of membrane centred over the joint gap, with a movement reserve calculated for the design displacement range — integrated with the surrounding roof waterproofing system.

### Bridge and Civil Infrastructure Joints

Bridges impose the most demanding conditions on expansion joint seals. Three forces act simultaneously: thermal expansion of the deck (which can reach 30 to 50 mm in medium-span bridges in the Portuguese interior), traffic loading (producing dynamic deflection of the span), and seismic action (inducing relative displacement between adjacent spans or between deck and abutment).

For bridge joints carrying light and moderate traffic, Membriko specifies pre-formed EPDM dumbbell or membrane-type profiles, sized for the design movement with a 2:1 safety factor. For bridges with heavy traffic where EPDM profiles are not rated for the axle loads, Membriko evaluates hybrid systems — structural metal framework with EPDM sealing in the waterproofing zone — and documents the selection rationale in the project report.

### Pavement and Ground-Level Joints

Ground-bearing concrete slabs — industrial floors, car parks, plazas, and external paved areas — are divided into panels by expansion joints and contraction joints. Waterproofing these joints is critical in underground floor slabs (where water infiltration affects structures below) and in exposed external pavements (where freeze-thaw cycling demands a material that will not fragment).

Membriko uses EPDM gland profiles for trafficked pavement joints, with a flush finish to the pavement surface and classification for pedestrian or light vehicle loading. For non-trafficked pavement joints (accessible roofs, technical terraces), the solution is EPDM membrane in a loop configuration, identical to the roof waterproofing application.

### Roof and Terrace Expansion Joints

Large flat roofs — industrial buildings, shopping centres, logistics warehouses — require expansion joints when the plan dimension exceeds 25 to 30 metres in any direction. Without joints, thermal expansion of the roof creates stresses that concentrate at the termination of the waterproofing system: at parapets, outlet flanges, service pipe penetrations, and material transitions, causing progressive lifting of the waterproofing membrane.

On roofs, expansion joints are subject to the largest temperature amplitudes in the entire structure. Dark-surfaced flat roofs in the Alentejo and Algarve routinely reach 75 to 85°C in July and August. The same surfaces can be near 0°C on a February night. This amplitude — 80 to 85°C across a year — produces significant joint movement even in roofs of moderate size. A 30-metre concrete roof can move 25 mm between seasonal thermal extremes. Membriko designs roof joints with a movement reserve of ±30% to accommodate the uncertainty in surface temperature data.

## Movement Capacity: ±25% Explained Through Engineering

The ±25% movement capacity specification is the parameter that most clearly distinguishes EPDM from all alternative joint sealing systems. But what does it mean precisely, and how does it translate into a real joint system?

**The working definition:**
In a 50 mm nominal width joint, sealed with EPDM designed for ±25% movement:
- Installation position (nominal): 50 mm joint width — the seal is in its neutral state
- Maximum opening (minimum temperature): 62.5 mm joint width — EPDM is extended by 12.5 mm
- Maximum closing (maximum temperature): 37.5 mm joint width — EPDM is compressed by 12.5 mm
- Total movement amplitude: 25 mm

**The safety margin:**
With an elongation at break of 400% and a working capacity of ±25%, the effective safety factor at maximum extension is 8:1. This margin is necessary because joint movement is not uniformly distributed along the full joint length — stress concentrations occur at corners, at intersections with other joints, and at transitions between different substrate materials. Membriko designs to the nominal capacity with confidence that local concentrations will not cause rupture.

**When to specify a wider joint:**
If the thermal movement calculation shows that total displacement demand exceeds 25% of the existing joint width, Membriko's design process recommends either widening the joint to restore the ±25% safety margin (preferred where structurally feasible), or specifying a deeper membrane fold or a higher-grade pre-formed profile with greater movement capacity (±35 to 50% for seismic-grade profiles or high-amplitude joints).

## Installation Techniques

Installing EPDM expansion joint seals requires a specific set of technical skills distinct from continuous surface waterproofing. Joint face preparation, movement reserve sizing, corner and intersection detailing, and post-installation testing are operations that demand specialist training. Membriko trains its technicians specifically for joint execution — not only for flat membrane application.

### EPDM Membrane Loop Method

The most versatile method for roof joints, terrace joints, and below-ground joints. Execution follows this sequence:

**1. Joint face preparation:** joint faces are ground or grit-blasted to produce a sound, dust-free surface with a pull-off resistance of at least 0.5 N/mm². All existing sealant residue, adhesive remnants, and incompatible primer are removed completely. The joint is blown clear with compressed air.

**2. Primer application:** EPDM-compatible primer is applied to the joint faces and the adjacent substrate surface over the full bonding width (minimum 100 mm each side of the joint). Flash-off time is observed strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's data sheet — premature application of adhesive to insufficiently cured primer produces a bond that will peel under dynamic loading.

**3. Membrane bonding at joint edges:** the EPDM membrane is bonded to each face of the joint, with a bonding width of 100 to 200 mm per side depending on joint dimension and design movement. The bonded zone must be flat and free of air entrapment. The membrane is not bonded across the joint gap — the fold reserve and the central zone remain unbonded to the substrate.

**4. Loop formation:** the membrane spanning the joint is folded into a loop centred over the joint gap, with a depth calculated for the required movement reserve — the loop depth must equal twice the maximum extension movement of the joint. For a joint with ±25% movement at 50 mm width (maximum extension 12.5 mm), the loop must be at least 25 mm deep.

**5. Cover strip:** a second strip of EPDM is bonded over the complete assembly — edges bonded to the substrate on each side, the central zone over the loop left unbonded — for UV protection and secondary waterproofing. The cover strip must be long enough that the unbonded zone is never pulled into tension when the joint is at maximum opening.

**6. Corners and intersections:** every change of direction receives factory-moulded EPDM corner pieces with the exact geometry of the corner. Factory-moulded corners are superior to field-formed pieces: field-cut geometry at joint corners is the most common cause of early failure in joint sealing systems.

**7. Movement test:** after full adhesive cure, Membriko technicians physically simulate the joint opening and closing movement — manually extending the loop to its full design extension — to verify that the installation accommodates the movement without stress at the bond line or tearing of the membrane.

### Pre-Formed Profile Method

For floor joints, facade joints, and infrastructure applications where an extruded profile is the appropriate technical solution, Membriko installs pre-formed EPDM profiles following this sequence:

**1. Profile selection:** the profile is selected based on the nominal joint width, the design movement amplitude, the loading condition (pedestrian, light vehicle, heavy vehicle), and the environmental exposure. Membriko maintains a range of dumbbell (centre-bulb), gland, and seismic-grade profiles from certified European manufacturers.

**2. Anchor groove preparation:** where the structure does not have a pre-formed anchor groove, Membriko machines the groove with precision cutting tools to the exact geometry required by the selected profile. An incorrectly formed groove is the most common cause of premature profile pull-out.

**3. Flap priming and bonding:** the anchor flanges (flaps) of the profile are bonded to the joint faces with EPDM contact adhesive or two-component epoxy adhesive, depending on the mechanical demand level. In joints with high movement or dynamic loading, the flanges are additionally anchored with a metal termination bar and expansion fasteners through the concrete.

**4. Dimensional verification:** after installation, the profile position is checked with a template: the profile must be centred over the joint gap within ±5 mm tolerance; the flanges must be fully bonded without lifting or air pockets; the centre bulb must be free of pre-stress in the nominal joint position.

### Backing Rod and Membrane Method

For joints with irregular geometry — existing joints where width varies along the length, joints with damaged or non-parallel concrete faces — Membriko uses a system combining an expanded polyethylene backer rod with EPDM membrane bonded over the joint face:

**1. Backer rod insertion:** the backer rod is inserted at the calculated depth to create a backing surface for the membrane at the correct position. The rod diameter must be 25% greater than the joint width to ensure adequate compression and prevent displacement during membrane installation.

**2. Membrane bonding:** the EPDM membrane is bonded to the joint faces on each side, with sufficient bonding width to achieve the required pull-off resistance. The membrane covers the backer rod without being bonded to it — the zone above the rod is the movement reserve.

**3. Edge seal:** the edge of the EPDM membrane is sealed with an EPDM-compatible polyurethane sealant (tested and approved by Membriko) to prevent capillary water ingress beneath the membrane at the bond line.

## Pre-Formed EPDM Joint Profiles: Product Families

Pre-formed EPDM joint profiles are factory-extruded or factory-moulded pieces designed for specific application contexts. Membriko works with certified European suppliers — all products with CE marking and performance documentation to EN 13956 — and selects the appropriate profile for each application based on project data.

### Centre-Bulb (Dumbbell) Profiles

The most versatile family and the most widely used in building construction. The profile has two flat anchor flanges connected by a centre bulb that acts as a material reservoir: as the joint opens, the bulb extends; as the joint closes, the bulb compresses. The bulb geometry is sized for the specified movement amplitude — larger bulbs for greater movement, smaller bulbs for narrow joints with limited movement.

Membriko offers centre-bulb profiles for joints from 20 to 150 mm nominal width, with ±25% movement capacity in standard configuration and ±35% in high-performance configuration. Projected service life under Portuguese climatic conditions is 40 to 50 years, based on field data from European installations in equivalent temperature and UV exposure climates.

### Gland Profiles (Trafficable)

Gland profiles are installed flush with the finished floor surface, in a pre-formed or machine-cut channel in the slab. The top surface of the profile is flat or slightly concave, compatible with pedestrian and light vehicle traffic. Aluminium-framed versions are available for heavy vehicle loading in car parks and logistics warehouses.

Membriko specifies EPDM gland profiles for joints in accessible pavements — car park roof slabs, public plazas and paved external spaces, industrial floors. Trafficable EPDM has a Shore A hardness of 60 to 70 — firm enough to resist traffic wear, but elastic enough to follow ±20% joint movement.

### Waterstop Profiles (Below Ground)

Waterstop profiles are cast into concrete during the pour — the anchor flange becomes embedded in each concrete element, creating a waterproofing barrier that does not depend on surface adhesion but on mechanical interlocking with the concrete. These are the preferred solution for:

- Expansion joints in the base slabs of concrete swimming pools
- Basement wall joints under high water table conditions
- Retaining structure and tunnel joints
- Any joint subject to hydrostatic pressure on the negative face (the side opposite the installation)

The special EPDM formulation for waterstop profiles has documented resistance to concrete alkalinity for 50 years of service, based on accelerated immersion test data in saturated calcium hydroxide solution.

### Seismic-Grade Profiles

For joints in structures located in NP EN 1998-1 Seismic Zones 1 and 2 — which include Lisbon, Setúbal, the Algarve, and the southern Alentejo coast — Membriko specifies seismic-grade profiles with combined movement capacity: ±40 to 50% opening and closing combined with ±20% shear movement (translation parallel to the joint plane). This combined movement requirement distinguishes seismic joints from all other joint types — and it is the requirement that conventional sealants and standard profiles cannot satisfy.

Seismic profiles have been tested to EN 1337 for combined displacement under cyclic loading simulating the design response spectrum. Membriko makes test reports for seismic profiles available to structural engineers who request them for design verification.

## EPDM vs Alternative Joint Sealing Systems

Selecting an expansion joint sealing system is an engineering decision — not a first-cost decision. Membriko presents the following comparisons as objective technical information, not commercial argument. The aim is to give designers and building owners the data they need to make an informed choice.

### EPDM vs Polysulphide Sealants

Polysulphide sealants were for decades the industry standard for facade and roof joints across Portugal. Their UV and weathering resistance is reasonable for a two-component sealant. Their technical limitations for expansion joints are fundamental:

**Movement capacity:** ±12.5% of joint width — half of EPDM's capacity. A joint with a design movement of ±20% (a common value in buildings in the Portuguese interior) is outside the capacity of polysulphide, which will fracture prematurely under repeated cycling.

**Service life in Portugal:** 10 to 20 years, limited by UV degradation of the sealant surface and by progressive loss of adhesion to concrete faces as the bonding agent ages. Membriko regularly encounters polysulphide joints installed 12 to 15 years ago that show partial or total debonding — the seal looks intact visually, but the joint is open at the critical bonded interface.

**Lifecycle cost:** the cost of replacing polysulphide every 10 to 20 years — removing the existing sealant, preparing the faces, installing and testing the new sealant — is substantially greater than the cost of a single EPDM installation with a 50-year service life.

### EPDM vs Metal Cover Plates

Metal cover plates — aluminium or anodised stainless steel sheets with a central hinge over the joint gap — are the traditional solution for joints on large commercial roofs and heavy-traffic bridges. Their advantages are mechanical strength and visual inspectability. Their limitations:

**Corrosion:** in coastal environments — Portugal's entire Atlantic coastal strip — corrosion of aluminium cover plates and their fixing screws is accelerated by atmospheric salinity. Metal covers in coastal environments may require replacement after 15 to 25 years, depending on alloy grade and surface treatment.

**Thermal bridging:** metal cover plates conduct heat and cold. On roofs with thermal insulation, a metal plate spanning the joint creates a thermal bridge that undermines the energy performance of the system and can cause interstitial condensation.

**Noise:** on pavement joints with heavy traffic, metal plates vibrate as vehicles pass, producing noise and accelerating fixing wear. In urban environments, this noise is a persistent source of complaints.

EPDM does not corrode, does not conduct heat to any significant degree, and does not vibrate. For the majority of applications in buildings and light-traffic infrastructure, EPDM is the technically superior solution. For heavy-traffic bridge joints where EPDM profiles are not rated for the axle loads, Membriko evaluates each case and documents the selection analysis.

### EPDM vs PVC and Neoprene Profiles

Plasticised PVC and neoprene profiles were widely used in building and infrastructure joints from the 1970s through the 2000s. Their limitations for applications in the Portuguese climate are now well documented:

**PVC:** plasticiser migration through leaching in high-temperature, high-UV environments. After 15 to 20 years in typical inland Alentejo conditions, PVC profiles may have lost 20 to 40% of their plasticiser content, becoming brittle. Failure is typically abrupt — the profile fractures along the centre bulb — and is often discovered only when active water infiltration is already occurring.

**Neoprene:** better UV resistance than PVC, but greater susceptibility to ozone than EPDM. Tropospheric ozone, at elevated concentrations in urban areas and near major traffic routes, attacks the surface of neoprene, producing micro-cracks that compromise long-term waterproofing capacity. In high-traffic-density locations — motorways, urban bridges, car parks in shopping centres — ozone attack on neoprene is a relevant degradation mechanism.

EPDM has confirmed ozone resistance with no surface cracking at 100 pphm (EN 1844), far above the maximum ambient concentrations in Portugal (typically 40 to 80 ppb = 0.04 to 0.08 pphm in urban areas).

## Designing for Movement: Membriko's Engineering Approach

Membriko does not specify joint sealing systems without a documented design process. Every expansion joint project begins with a written design report that quantifies the movement demand, verifies the joint geometry, selects the sealing system, details the critical points, and specifies the post-installation tests. This report is delivered to the client before work begins.

### Step 1: Design Movement Quantification

The design movement calculation integrates three components:

**Thermal component:** calculated from the thermal expansion coefficient of the structural material (reinforced concrete: 10 × 10⁻⁶/°C; structural steel: 12 × 10⁻⁶/°C), the length of the structural element between joints, and the effective surface temperature range for the geographical location of the project. Temperature data is taken from IPMA climatological normals for the nearest meteorological station, corrected for structural surface temperature based on orientation, surface colour, and solar exposure.

**Seismic component:** where applicable (NP EN 1998-1 Seismic Zones 1 and 2), the design seismic displacement is calculated using the Eurocode 8 simplified method or obtained from the structural engineer responsible for the project.

**Differential settlement component:** for large buildings, bridges on dissimilar soils, and structures with a history of movement, Membriko requests geotechnical data or estimates from the geotechnical engineer. On existing structures, the historical record of joint movement (where available) is the most reliable input.

### Step 2: Joint Geometry Verification

The existing joint width is measured at multiple points along its length to identify variations that may indicate movement already experienced or non-uniform construction. On existing joints, the relationship between the current width and the original design width (where known) provides information about the current state of structural movement.

### Step 3: System Selection

With design movement quantified and geometry verified, Membriko selects:
- The system type (membrane loop, pre-formed profile, or backing rod with membrane)
- The specific product from the approved range, with verified performance documentation
- The loop dimension or bulb profile that accommodates the movement with the appropriate safety factor

All products that Membriko specifies carry CE marking to EN 13956 (membranes) or EN 1337 (structural profiles), or LNEC DTA national technical approval for products with Portuguese national approval.

### Step 4: Corner and Intersection Detailing

The most critical point of any expansion joint sealing system is not the straight run — it is the corner. Where a joint changes direction (horizontal to vertical, wall to slab, roof to parapet), the sealing system must make the transition without compromising the integrity of the assembly. Membriko uses exclusively factory-moulded EPDM pieces for these points — box corners, T-pieces, angle transitions — because field-formed transition geometry at joint corners is the most common cause of early failure in expansion joint sealing systems.

### Step 5: Post-Installation Verification

Before any certification or warranty issue, Membriko executes:
- Pull test on membrane bonding zones — minimum 0.3 N/mm²
- Physical movement simulation: manual extension of the loop to full design movement
- Watertightness test: ponding for accessible horizontal joints; pressurised water test for below-ground applications before backfill
- Complete photographic record of every joint section, before and after installation

## Maintenance and Long-Term Performance

One of the most significant advantages of EPDM over liquid sealants and PVC profiles is its maintainability. EPDM can be visually inspected, can be repaired by patch bonding in the event of localised damage, and does not require periodic replacement as polysulphide sealants do.

### Annual Inspection Programme

Membriko recommends annual visual inspection of EPDM-sealed expansion joints, covering:

**Visual check:** debris accumulation in the joint zone (which can restrict movement and increase membrane stress); signs of mechanical puncture or third-party damage from later trades or installed equipment; condition of the loop or profile bulb — the loop must be centred and free of visible permanent deformation; condition of membrane bond edges — no lifting, no cracking, no debonding.

**Cleaning:** removal of debris, dry leaves, and sediment from the joint zone. In floor joints, cleaning of the channel with pressurised water to prevent blockage of the associated drainage system.

### Periodic Inspection (Every Five Years)

Every five years, Membriko offers an in-depth technical inspection that includes:
- Pull test on bonding zones to verify that adhesion resistance is maintained
- Movement test: physical extension of the loop or bulb to the full design movement
- Compression set assessment: comparison of the current bulb dimension with the original dimension recorded in the installation report
- Comparative photographic record against the installation archive

### Localised EPDM Repair

In the event of localised mechanical damage — puncture by a sharp object, cutting by construction equipment from later works, tearing at a corner zone — EPDM can be repaired by:

1. Cleaning and preparation of the damaged area
2. Application of an EPDM patch with primer and double-sided EPDM seam tape
3. Pressing and curing for the time specified by the manufacturer
4. Localised watertightness test before accepting the repair

This localised repair does not require removal of the existing joint sealing system — a fundamental advantage over polysulphide and polyurethane sealants, which require complete removal before any effective re-application.

## Portuguese Thermal Cycling Data and Joint Design

Membriko designs all expansion joint sealing systems using climate data specific to the location of each project — not generic European values that under-represent the actual conditions across mainland Portugal.

### Temperature Ranges by Climate Zone

The following values are based on IPMA climatological normals (1991–2020) and structural surface temperature measurements from Membriko projects:

**Lisbon and Greater Lisbon Area:**

### Implication for Joint Design

The most important observation from this data is that the interior of Portugal — particularly the Alto Alentejo, Trás-os-Montes, and Beira Interior — has the largest surface temperature amplitudes and therefore the largest joint movement demands of any Portuguese region. Structures in these zones with joints designed to coastal Lisbon conditions will be systematically underspecified.

Membriko always verifies the climate data for the specific project location. Generic joint sizing or "national averages" are not accepted as inputs, because a sealant installed with inadequate movement allowance will fail prematurely regardless of the quality of its installation.

## Seismic Joint Requirements in Portugal

Portugal carries the highest seismic risk in Western Europe outside Greece and Italy. Portuguese legislation — Decree-Law 307/2009 and the National Annex to NP EN 1998-1 — defines the seismic zones of the territory and the reference accelerations for structural design. Expansion joints in structures located in the highest seismic hazard zones have displacement requirements far beyond what most conventional sealants can accommodate.

### Seismic Zones and Joint Requirements

**Zone 1 (Lisbon and Tagus Valley, southern Alentejo coast):** reference acceleration agR = 1.5 m/s² (Action Type 1) and 1.7 m/s² (Action Type 2). For standard reinforced concrete buildings, the maximum relative displacement between adjacent elements can reach 25 to 50 mm. Expansion joints in these zones must be designed for this displacement in combination with the thermal movement component.

**Zone 2 (Algarve and southern coast):** reference acceleration agR = 1.1 m/s² (Action Type 2). Seismic displacement requirements are slightly lower than Zone 1 but remain significant for medium- and large-scale reinforced concrete structures.

**Zones 3 and 4 (remainder of territory, including Porto and northern Portugal):** lower seismic hazard; joint design is dominated by thermal movement. Seismic requirements for joints are less critical, but must still be verified for structures located on or near identified geological fault zones.

### Seismic Joint vs Thermal Expansion Joint: The Difference

A thermal expansion joint accommodates essentially unidirectional movement — opening and closing along an axis perpendicular to the joint plane. A seismic joint must accommodate three movement components simultaneously:

1. **Opening and closing (tension-compression):** the primary movement component, identical to a thermal joint
2. **Shear (parallel translation):** the two adjacent structures can move in opposite directions parallel to the joint plane — this component is frequently neglected in building joint specifications and is a cause of premature sealant failure in joints that were designed only for tension-compression
3. **Rotation:** differences in the rotational displacement of the two adjacent structures produce angular offsets at the joint that must be accommodated without stress concentration

The seismic-grade EPDM profiles that Membriko specifies have been tested for combined tension-compression and shear movement, and are selected based on all three calculated displacement components for each project.

## Retrofit of Failed Joints: The Renovation Market

A significant portion of the expansion joint work that Membriko undertakes across Portugal involves the remediation of seals that have already failed — polysulphide with debonding, PVC profiles fractured through embrittlement, metal cover plates lifted by corrosion at their fixings. Retrofitting failed joint seals is technically more demanding than new construction, because it requires analysis of the current joint condition, removal of the existing system without structural damage, and design verification against the actual movements the structure is now experiencing — which may differ from the original design movements.

### Most Common Failure Patterns in Portugal

**Polysulphide debonding:** the sealant has lost adhesion to one or both joint faces, leaving an open interface at the bond line. Visible as a hairline separation between sealant and concrete along the joint edge. The sealant body may appear intact, but the joint is open at the adhesion zone. Membriko routinely finds this condition in joints installed 12 to 15 years ago — the failure is invisible to a non-specialist visual inspection and is typically discovered only when a leak is already active below.

**Cohesive sealant failure (splitting):** the sealant has cracked through its body, typically at mid-height, as a result of movement exceeding its elastic capacity. This occurs in joints where the sealant was installed with insufficient width for the actual structural movement — the width-to-depth ratio was specified for ±12.5% movement but the structure has actual movement of ±20%.

**PVC profile embrittlement:** the profile has fractured along its centre bulb as a result of plasticiser loss. Failure is typically abrupt — the profile maintains its external appearance until the moment of collapse. After fracture, the joint is completely open and water infiltration is immediate.

**Metal cover plate corrosion and lifting:** fixings have corroded, the plate has lifted from the surface, and water enters beneath the plate during rain events. In coastal environments, this process can occur within 10 to 15 years even with moderate-quality aluminium alloy or stainless steel.

### Membriko Retrofit Protocol

**1. Inspection and diagnosis:** technical site visit to determine the failure pattern, measure current joint width against design width (where known), identify any structural damage to joint faces requiring prior repair, and assess whether the original design movement remains valid or must be recalculated.

**2. Existing system removal:** the existing sealant or profile is removed in its entirety. Removal of high-adhesion polysulphide sealant may require specific cutting tools to avoid damage to the concrete joint edges. All adhesive residues and incompatible primer are removed by grinding or grit-blasting.

**3. Face repair:** cracks or spalling in joint faces are repaired with structural cement-based repair mortar (EN 1504-3, class R3 or R4) before the new seal is installed. The geometry of any anchor groove is verified and corrected where necessary.

**4. System recalculation:** Membriko verifies the design movement using updated climate data and the as-found joint geometry. If the joint width is insufficient for the design movement with the required safety factor, this finding is documented in the report and options are presented to the client.

**5. Installation and testing:** following the standard installation protocol described in preceding sections, with all quality control steps executed before the warranty certificate is issued.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What is the minimum joint width for effective EPDM waterproofing?**

Membriko specifies EPDM for joints with a minimum width of 20 mm. Below 20 mm, the formation of a movement loop is geometrically constrained. For joints narrower than 20 mm with significant design movement, the standard solution is to widen the joint to 20 to 25 mm before installing the seal. In very narrow joints with minimal movement (essentially static structures, primarily aesthetic sealing), a high-quality polyurethane sealant may be acceptable — Membriko evaluates each case and documents the decision.

**2. Is EPDM for expansion joints compatible with concrete, steel, and timber substrates?**

Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to concrete (including the high alkalinity of concrete pore solutions at pH 12 to 13), to steel (including galvanised and stainless steel), and to timber. Adhesion of EPDM to each substrate requires the correct primer and adhesive system — Membriko always specifies the primer and adhesive combination verified by the product manufacturer for each substrate. In joints with mixed substrates (for example, concrete on one face and steel on the other), the adhesion systems may differ on each side, and this is made explicit in the project report.

**3. How long does EPDM expansion joint installation take on a 20-metre run?**

For a standard 20-metre roof expansion joint using the membrane loop method, the typical installation duration is one to two days, including face preparation, primer flash-off time, membrane installation, and watertightness testing. This assumes joint faces are in sound condition and do not require structural repair. Joints with damaged faces or requiring complex removal of an existing system may need one to two additional days of preparation. Membriko provides a detailed work programme with every quotation.

**4. Can EPDM be applied to an existing joint without removing the old sealant?**

Not as a rule. Membriko does not overlay EPDM onto existing sealants, because the performance of the new seal depends on the quality of adhesion to the substrate — and a substrate covered with aged sealant residue cannot guarantee that quality. Complete removal of the existing sealant is always recommended. In exceptional cases where the existing sealant is firmly bonded (verified by pull test) and is chemically compatible with the EPDM primer, an overlay may be evaluated — but this is the exception, not the rule, and is documented explicitly in the project report.

**5. How is the required movement capacity calculated for an expansion joint in Portugal?**

The calculation has three components: (1) thermal movement, calculated from the thermal expansion coefficient of the structural material, the element length between joints, and the effective surface temperature range for the project's geographical location (IPMA data corrected for structural surface temperature); (2) seismic displacement, where applicable under NP EN 1998-1 for the project's seismic zone; (3) differential settlement, estimated from geotechnical data or the structure's movement history. Membriko performs this calculation for every project and presents the results in the design report delivered to the client before any work begins.

**6. Does EPDM for expansion joints meet the requirements of NP EN 1998-1 (seismic)?**

NP EN 1998-1 (Eurocode 8) does not directly define watertightness requirements for seismic joint seals — it defines the design displacements that joints must be able to accommodate. Seismic-grade EPDM, with combined movement capacity of ±40 to 50%, meets the displacement requirements for the vast majority of joints in standard-importance structures in Portuguese Seismic Zones 1 and 2. For exceptional-importance structures (hospitals, emergency centres), increased design displacements must be verified case by case.

**7. What is the difference between an expansion joint and a settlement joint?**

Expansion joints primarily accommodate reversible movement caused by temperature variation. Settlement joints primarily accommodate irreversible movement caused by differential ground settlement. In practice, the vast majority of structural joints in Portuguese buildings are designed to accommodate both — and are therefore designated "movement joints" or, generically, "expansion joints" even when they have a settlement component. The joint seal design must consider both components regardless of the terminology used in the project specification.

**8. Does Membriko offer periodic inspection services for existing expansion joints?**

Yes. Membriko offers two levels of inspection service: annual visual and photographic inspection (recommended as part of the building maintenance plan), and a five-yearly in-depth technical inspection that includes pull testing, movement simulation, and a technical report compared against the installation record. For buildings with multiple expansion joints, Membriko organises an inspection plan that covers all joints in a single working day, minimising disruption to building occupants. For clients who do not have the original installation documentation for their joints, Membriko provides a current-condition diagnostic service with a residual service life estimate.

## Watertightness for the Lifetime of the Structure

Expansion joints are critical points — and Membriko treats them as such. Every joint Membriko executes begins with a movement calculation, goes through a documented system selection, is installed by technicians trained specifically for this work, and is tested before acceptance. No joint is handed over without a complete photographic record and without the quality report documenting the process from diagnosis to delivery.

Membriko's 20-year installation warranty covers EPDM expansion joint sealing work on the same terms as our roof waterproofing warranty: Membriko is responsible for any water infiltration resulting from an installation defect during the warranty period. This warranty is separate from and additional to the statutory civil liability of the contractor provided under the Portuguese Civil Code (Article 1225).
