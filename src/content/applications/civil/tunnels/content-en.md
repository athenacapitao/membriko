# Tunnel Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Portuguese Tunnel Infrastructure and What Is at Stake

Portugal maintains a tunnel infrastructure network that grows with every transport investment
cycle. From metro tunnels beneath Lisbon and Porto, to road galleries through the Serra do
Marão and Gardunha mountains, from the rail corridors under active construction in the
Ferrovia 2020 programme to the high-speed rail lines planned across the country — the
waterproofing of underground structures is one of the most demanding and most permanent
applications in contemporary Portuguese civil engineering.

The fundamental difference between waterproofing a tunnel and waterproofing any other structure
is irreversibility. A roof with a defective membrane can be inspected from outside and repaired
with straightforward access. A pool liner can be replaced in days. But the waterproofing
membrane of a tunnel is installed between the primary concrete lining and the secondary cast
concrete — it is, literally, encased within the structure. Once construction is complete, the
membrane is inaccessible. It must perform for 100 years, under constant hydrostatic pressure,
through seismic events, through temperature cycles, and through the inevitable structural
movements of a buried structure. There is no second chance.

Membriko, based in Pombal with civil engineering project experience, works with EPDM
geomembrane specifically for this reality: the solution engineered to outlast the structure
it waterproofs. Our tunnel specification is based on EN 13491 (Geosynthetic barriers for
underground waterproofing) and the performance class appropriate to each project — from Class B
for structures with a low groundwater table, to Class D for tunnels beneath rivers or estuaries
with hydrostatic pressures exceeding 400 kPa. This page explains the reasoning behind each
technical decision with the same depth that Membriko uses in specification consultations with
design engineers and infrastructure owners.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Solution for Tunnel Waterproofing

### The Three Fundamental Requirements

Any tunnel waterproofing system must simultaneously address three non-negotiable demands:

**1. Sustained hydrostatic resistance:** The hydrostatic pressure exerted by the groundwater
table on the membrane is not a one-off demand — it is permanent, and it lasts for 100 years.
The membrane must resist the pressure of the water column above the tunnel invert without
penetration, without irreversible deformation of lap joints, and without loss of adhesion to
the concrete substrate. For a tunnel with the groundwater table 20 m above the invert, the
hydrostatic pressure at the base of the walls is 200 kPa — EN 13491 Class C. For a tunnel
beneath the Tagus estuary, pressure may exceed 400 kPa — Class D.

**2. Chemical resistance over 100 years:** Portuguese groundwater is not chemically neutral.
In the granitic and schistose formations of the Minho and Serra da Estrela, groundwater is
slightly acidic (pH 4.5-6.5) with low ionic strength. In the limestone formations of the
Algarve and the Alentejo limestone belt, it is alkaline (pH 7.5-8.5) and rich in calcium
and bicarbonate. In urban fills containing demolition debris and historical contamination, it
may carry chlorinated solvents, petroleum hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. The membrane must
be stable across this entire range for a century — and no waterproofing material provides this
chemical neutrality with the certainty of EPDM.

**3. Accommodation of structural movements:** A tunnel's concrete structure is not static. It
shrinks as it cures, settles under backfill loads, expands and contracts through seasonal
temperature cycles at portals, and undergoes seismic deformation at construction joints and
interfaces with rigid connected structures. The membrane must accommodate these movements
without tearing, without delamination, and without joint opening. EPDM, with 300 to 500%
elongation at break, provides a deformation reserve that no rigid or semi-rigid membrane can
match.

### The Chemistry That Guarantees 100 Years

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a rubber elastomer whose performance in contact with
groundwater is underpinned by its main polymer chain architecture: fully saturated, with no C=C
double bonds available to be attacked by oxidising agents, acids, or the aggressive compounds
present in natural groundwater. This chemical resistance is not conferred by additives or
surface coatings that deplete with time — it is intrinsic to the vulcanised polymer.

Compare this with PVC sheet membranes used in many tunnel projects: PVC contains 20 to 40%
by mass of plasticisers to achieve the flexibility required for use as a tunnel waterproofing
membrane. These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to the PVC — they can migrate into the
surrounding concrete and groundwater over decades, gradually making the membrane stiffer and
more brittle. In a tunnel with a 100-year design life, Membriko specifies EPDM precisely
because plasticiser loss is a degradation mechanism that EPDM simply does not possess.

## Tunnel Types — Cut-and-Cover, Bored and Immersed Tube

### Cut-and-Cover Tunnels

The cut-and-cover method involves excavating an open trench, constructing the concrete structure
within the excavation, and backfilling over it. This method is used for:
- Urban metro stations where depth permits open excavation
- Road underpasses and grade-separated crossings in urban environments
- Underground car parks, service galleries, and utility corridors
- Railway tunnels in shallow urban terrain where bored construction is not justified

**Full tanking waterproofing system:**

The standard waterproofing strategy for cut-and-cover structures below the permanent groundwater
table is complete wrapping of the outer surface of the concrete structure with a continuous EPDM
membrane — walls, base slab and roof form a fully sealed tank. Membriko executes this system
in two variants:

**Pre-applied EPDM:** The EPDM membrane is secured to the excavation face (sheet piles, jet-
grout wall, or prepared rock face) before the structural concrete is poured. Concrete is cast
directly against the membrane, creating an intimate composite assembly. This variant eliminates
the gap between membrane and concrete that exists in post-applied systems, removing the risk of
groundwater tracking along the interface if a point defect occurs.

**Post-applied EPDM:** The membrane is applied to the external face of the completed concrete
structure before backfill. It allows full visual inspection during installation and correction
of any detected defect before the structure is buried. Membriko executes post-application in
a fully adhered system, with defined lap seam overlaps and mechanical fixing at termination zones.

### Bored and NATM Tunnels

Bored tunnels are driven by tunnel boring machine (TBM) or by the New Austrian Tunnelling Method
(NATM), also known as the sequential excavation method. In Portugal, both methods are used: TBM
in urban metro sections through more homogeneous soils; NATM in road and rail tunnels through
rock. The dominant waterproofing system for bored tunnels with a secondary concrete lining —
used in the Lisbon and Porto metro systems, and in road tunnels across Portugal — consists of
four components:

1. **Primary lining:** Sprayed concrete (shotcrete) applied directly to the excavated profile,
   stabilising the ground and creating the support surface for the membrane
2. **Protection geotextile:** Non-woven polypropylene geotextile (500-700 g/m²) installed over
   the primary lining, protecting the EPDM membrane from shotcrete surface irregularities
3. **EPDM geomembrane:** 2.0 to 3.0 mm, installed over the geotextile with mechanical fixing
   by batten bars at defined spacings; lap seams formed in accessible conditions before secondary
   concrete placement
4. **Secondary lining:** Reinforced cast-in-place concrete cast against the EPDM membrane;
   forms the definitive tunnel structure and permanently confines the membrane under load

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for Class C and 2.5-3.0 mm for Class D in this system, in
accordance with the design hydrostatic pressure and EN 13491 requirements.

### Immersed Tube Tunnels

Immersed tube tunnels are constructed by pre-fabricating concrete tube sections in a dry dock
or fabrication yard, floating them to the crossing location, sinking them into a pre-dredged
trench, and connecting them at depth. This method is used for river and estuary crossings where
depth or span make bored construction impractical or disproportionately costly.

Membriko applies EPDM waterproofing to immersed tube elements in controlled fabrication yard
conditions, with all the advantages of a dry installation — complete seam inspection, integrity
testing before float-out, and exhaustive photographic documentation. The pre-fabricated elements
arrive at the crossing site with the membrane already installed and certified.

---

## Hydrostatic Pressure Resistance

Hydrostatic pressure is the dominant technical requirement in tunnel waterproofing. Membriko
dimensions the membrane system to the design pressure calculated from the design groundwater
level determined by the geotechnical investigation, with the applicable safety factor.

### EN 13491 Performance Classes

EN 13491 classifies geosynthetic barriers for underground structures into performance classes
based on their hydrostatic resistance:

| EN 13491 Class | Hydrostatic Pressure | Typical Application |
|---|---|---|
| Class A | ≤ 50 kPa (≤ 5 m water head) | Very shallow structures, low water table |
| Class B | ≤ 100 kPa (≤ 10 m water head) | Standard cut-and-cover, moderate conditions |
| Class C | ≤ 200 kPa (≤ 20 m water head) | Bored tunnels with moderate groundwater table |
| Class D | ≤ 400+ kPa (≤ 40+ m water head) | Tunnels under rivers, deep metro, estuary crossings |

### Translation to Portuguese Geology

The appropriate EN 13491 class for each project is determined by the geotechnical investigation.
Some examples of Portuguese geological contexts and their implications:

**Granite and schist (Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Serra da Estrela):** Groundwater table generally
moderate at ridge elevations, high in river valleys. Water is slightly acidic (pH 4.5-6.5) with
low chemical aggressivity. Class B or C in most cases; Class D in sections beneath mountain rivers.

**Quaternary alluvial formations (Tagus and Sado valleys):** High groundwater tables, frequently
close to the surface. Relatively low-permeability soils with artesian pressure in some zones.
Class C or D for metro tunnels beneath Lisbon (Tagus valley quaternary).

**Limestone and karst (Algarve, Alentejo):** Variable groundwater table with potential for high
flows at karstic discontinuities. Alkaline water (pH 7.5-8.5), non-aggressive to EPDM. Class B
or C in most applications.

**Contaminated urban fills:** Potential presence of chlorinated solvents, petroleum hydrocarbons,
and heavy metals. Membriko's EPDM is resistant to aliphatic hydrocarbons and the typical range
of urban aquifer contaminants at groundwater concentrations.

Membriko reviews the project geotechnical report and proposes the appropriate EN 13491 class
before any membrane thickness or product specification is established.

## EPDM Tunnel Membrane Installation Process

Membriko follows a documented, EN 13491-compliant installation process for each phase of tunnel
membrane work. In tunnel projects, installation traceability is essential — every panel, every
seam, and every singular detail must be photographically recorded before it is concealed by the
secondary lining concrete.

### Step 1: Project Review and Specification

Before any site work, Membriko undertakes a detailed review of:

- Geotechnical and hydrogeological report: design groundwater level, groundwater chemical
  characteristics, permeability of the formations traversed
- Tunnel longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles: geometry, depth, typical cross-section,
  and variations along the alignment
- Construction joint locations: points of highest hydrostatic risk and greatest probability
  of differential movement
- Interfaces with rigid structures (stations, access shafts, junction chambers): zones requiring
  expansion joint waterproofing details

Based on this review, Membriko issues the technical specification for the membrane system:
thickness, EN 13491 class, protection geotextile, compartmentalisation grid, singular point
details, and seismic expansion joint designs.

### Step 2: Installation Plan and Compartmentalisation Layout

The installation layout defines:

- **Panels and seams:** positioning of EPDM panels, location of longitudinal and transverse
  seams, minimum 150 mm lap overlaps, staggered seam arrangement to avoid triple-point junctions
- **Compartmentalisation grid:** spacing of batten bar compartment strips that divide the space
  between primary lining and membrane into discrete sealed cells; typically a 5 x 5 m grid for
  cut-and-cover tunnels, 3 m ring spacing for bored tunnel applications
- **Injection ports:** one injection port per compartment, accessible from inside the tunnel
  after secondary lining concrete placement
- **Singular points:** location of all penetrations (drainage pipes, monitoring cables,
  ventilation ducts) and their waterproofing details

### Step 3: Support Surface Preparation

The quality of the support surface directly influences the long-term reliability of the membrane
system. Membriko carries out:

- Primary shotcrete lining inspection: identification of protrusions, sharp edges, exposed
  reinforcement ends, and areas of inadequate shotcrete quality
- Grinding and rectification of all sharp points with potential to puncture the membrane
- Localised repair of shotcrete areas with cracking, spalling, or insufficient thickness
- Installation of the protection geotextile (500-700 g/m² non-woven PP) immediately before
  the EPDM membrane — the geotextile is fixed to the primary lining with plastic nail fixings
  and distributes point loads that would otherwise concentrate on the membrane

### Step 4: EPDM Geomembrane Installation

Installation begins at the tunnel invert and progresses laterally to the walls and then to the
crown. Membriko follows this sequence because:

- The invert receives the highest hydrostatic pressure and must be installed first, without
  residual installation stresses
- Progression from invert to crown allows the longitudinal wall seams to be executed with the
  membrane already stabilised in the lower zone

The EPDM membrane is mechanically fixed to the primary lining with aluminium or rigid PVC batten
bar strips, secured with nylon expansion anchors at defined spacings. Crown panels require
positive support (internal scaffolding) to prevent sagging before secondary lining concrete pour.

### Step 5: Seam Execution and Sealing

All seams are executed using the QuickSeam system (QuickPrime Plus primer plus 150 mm wide
QuickSeam lap tape), applied with uniform silicone roller pressure. Membriko's seam execution
process includes:

- Cleaning and preparation of lap faces with isopropanol
- Application of QuickPrime Plus primer with cure time appropriate to tunnel temperature and
  humidity conditions
- Application of QuickSeam tape with uniform roller pressure of 150 N/mm
- Metal probe testing along the full length of each seam
- Photographic record of each seam before advancing to the next panel

Seams at concrete construction joints — the zones of highest hydrostatic risk — receive additional
reinforcement: a second 300 mm wide QuickSeam strip centred over the joint, providing a reserve
of sealing capacity at the zones most likely to experience differential movement.

### Step 6: Singular Points and Expansion Joints

Singular points in tunnels include:

**Drainage pipe penetrations:** Membriko installs pre-formed EPDM sleeve details with stainless
steel compression rings, creating a mechanical and chemical waterproof seal between the membrane
and each drainage pipe that passes through it.

**Monitoring cables and geotechnical instrumentation:** Small-diameter penetrations (extensometers,
piezometers, electrical cables) receive EPDM sleeve details with adjustable EPDM compression
collars sized to the cable diameter.

**Seismic expansion joints (tunnel-to-station, tunnel-to-shaft):** The interfaces between the
flexible tunnel lining and rigid connected structures are the highest-risk waterproofing joints
in any seismic event. Membriko designs dedicated EPDM expansion joint details with a bellows
geometry — a controlled excess of EPDM material formed into a fold that unfolds to accommodate
the differential displacement defined by the seismic design (EN 1998).

### Step 7: Compartmentalisation and Injection Ports

After complete membrane and singular point installation, Membriko installs the compartment batten
bar strips (heat-welded EPDM strips fixed to the primary lining) that divide the waterproofing
plane into discrete sealed cells. Each cell receives one injection port: an HDPE tube of 20 mm
fixed to the batten bar strip, passing through the membrane with a waterproof sleeve, and
terminating in a threaded cap accessible from inside the tunnel after secondary lining concrete
placement.

A full photographic record of the compartmentalisation grid and every injection port is delivered
to the client as as-built documentation.

### Step 8: Final Inspection, Verification and Documentation

Before authorising secondary lining concrete placement, Membriko carries out a systematic final
inspection:

- Metal probe testing of 100% of all seams
- Visual inspection of all singular points and penetration sleeves
- Confirmation of batten bar mechanical fixing and compartment strip tension
- Complete photographic record of the full installed surface
- EN 13491 conformity checklist sign-off

The documentation package delivered to the client includes: technical system specification,
installation records with geolocated photography, EN 13491 conformity declaration, EPDM product
certificates, and the Membriko installation warranty certificate.

## Compartmentalisation and Leak Management

Compartmentalisation is the design feature that distinguishes a professional tunnel waterproofing
system from a simple sheet membrane installation. Membriko always designs with compartmentalisation
for a fundamental technical reason: even the most rigorously installed waterproofing system carries
a finite probability of a point defect in a large structure. The question is not whether a defect
can occur — it is whether the system is designed to manage the consequences in a controlled and
remediable way.

### The Compartmentalisation Principle

Without compartmentalisation, a micro-perforation in the membrane — caused, for example, by a
shotcrete edge not detected during pre-installation inspection — allows groundwater to migrate
along the interface between primary lining and membrane, potentially emerging inside the tunnel
tens of metres from the origin. Locating and repairing the defect without demolishing the
secondary lining becomes practically impossible.

With compartmentalisation, the same micro-perforation is confined to the cell where it occurs.
Water enters only that cell, and the increase in drainage flow at that specific zone identifies
the affected compartment with precision. Remediation is straightforward: injection of micro-fine
cement grout or polyurethane foam through the injection port of the affected compartment, from
inside the tunnel, with no excavation or demolition.

### Remediation Cost With and Without Compartmentalisation

The cost of injecting one 5 x 5 m (25 m²) compartment in a compartmentalised system is typically
€2,000 to €10,000, depending on the volume injected. The cost of the alternative — localised
demolition of secondary lining concrete (300-600 mm thick reinforced concrete), access to the
membrane, repair, and re-casting — is typically €50,000 to €500,000, without accounting for
the operational tunnel closure. Membriko integrates compartmentalisation as an integral part
of every tunnel waterproofing project — it is not optional.

## EPDM vs PVC / Bentonite / Cementitious Waterproofing

Membriko presents this comparison with technical honesty. PVC is a legitimate material with
a strong track record in European tunnel waterproofing. The choice between EPDM and PVC is
a genuine technical decision, not a commercial preference.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | PVC Sheet | Bentonite GCL | Crystalline Cementitious |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 100+ years | 50-80 years (plasticiser loss) | 50+ years (if confined) | 20-40 years |
| Hydrostatic resistance | Class D (400+ kPa) | Class D (400+ kPa) | Class B (limited) | Dependent on concrete quality |
| Elongation / crack bridging | 300-500% | 200-300% | Self-sealing (micro-scale) | None |
| Fire safety | Low toxicity combustion | HCl generation (highly toxic) | Non-combustible | Non-combustible |
| Chemical resistance | pH 3.5-12, full Portuguese geology | pH 4-12 (plasticiser limits) | pH 7-11 (ionic sensitive) | Dependent on concrete integrity |
| Compartmentalisation | Yes — batten bar system | Yes — batten bar system | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| Repair without excavation | Yes — injection through ports | Yes — injection through ports | No | Limited injection possible |
| Seismic accommodation | Excellent — 300%+ elongation | Moderate | Poor | None |

**Note on PVC:** PVC sheet membranes have a strong track record in European tunnel waterproofing,
particularly in projects specifying the dual-weld seam with air channel testing, a well-
established QA protocol. Membriko's position is that EPDM is superior for tunnels with 100-year
design lives, significant seismic exposure, or demanding groundwater chemistry — specifically
because of the absence of plasticiser migration over a century, higher elongation capacity, and
the fire safety profile without HCl generation.

**Note on bentonite GCL:** Sodium bentonite geocomposite liners offer self-sealing capability
at low pressure but cannot withstand Class C or D hydrostatic pressures without very tight
confinement, and are sensitive to groundwater ionic strength — in saline terrain or near landfill
leachate, bentonite can suffer chemical deterioration. Across Portugal's diverse geology, EPDM
delivers more consistent and predictable performance than bentonite.

## Fire Safety in Tunnels

Fire safety is a critical design parameter in tunnels accessible to the public — road, rail, and
metro tunnels. The Mont Blanc fire (1999, 39 deaths) and the Fréjus fire (2005, 2 deaths) drove
a comprehensive revision of European tunnel safety standards. The fire behaviour of waterproofing
materials is part of this context and must be specified accordingly.

### EPDM vs PVC in a Fire Scenario

EPDM contains no halogens (chlorine, fluorine, bromine) in its base polymer chain. When burned,
EPDM primarily produces carbon dioxide and water vapour, with a toxicity index significantly lower
than PVC combustion products.

PVC contains approximately 57% chlorine by mass. When burned, PVC generates hydrogen chloride
(HCl) gas — highly toxic, immediately dangerous to life at concentrations above 35 ppm, and
corrosive to the electronic monitoring and communication systems within the tunnel. In bored
tunnels with a double lining, the membrane is encased between primary and secondary concrete
and is not directly exposed to the tunnel interior. However, in severe fires, secondary lining
concrete can spall, exposing the membrane. For public-access tunnels, Membriko specifies halogen-
free EPDM formulations as standard practice.

### Reaction to Fire Classification

EPDM tunnel membranes are classified for reaction to fire under EN 13501-1. Typical classification:
Euroclass D or E for standard EPDM. For public-access tunnels (metro, rail, road) with elevated
life-safety requirements, Membriko specifies halogen-free low-smoke EPDM formulations achieving
Euroclass D or C with low smoke opacity.

## Portuguese Tunnel Projects and Market Context

Portugal's transport infrastructure investment programme creates substantial demand for high-
performance tunnel waterproofing across multiple sectors.

**Lisbon Metro and Porto Metro:** Extension works and new lines for the Lisbon Metro (Red Line
extension to Alcântara, Odivelas line upgrades) and Porto Metro (new stations and driven tunnel
sections) involve tunnels with secondary lining concrete cast against geosynthetic membranes.
Membriko is prepared to support these projects with EN 13491 technical specification, membrane
supply, and installation.

**High-Speed Rail:** The Portuguese high-speed rail programme envisages significant tunnels in
the Porto-Lisbon connection, particularly in the Campanhã-Soure section and in the Lisbon-Évora
link. These tunnels will be subject to the most exacting geomembrane specification: 100-year
design life, significant seismic exposure in the southern zones, and variable hydrostatic
pressures along complex alignments.

**Túnel do Marão (A4/IC24):** At 5.6 km, the Marão tunnel is Portugal's longest road tunnel,
inaugurated in 2017 with a state-of-the-art geomembrane waterproofing system. This tunnel
represents current best practice in road tunnel waterproofing in Portugal and serves as a
reference for new project specification.

**Historical infrastructure rehabilitation:** A rapidly growing sector in Portugal is the
rehabilitation of 20th-century tunnel infrastructure with degraded or inadequate waterproofing.
Many tunnels on the national rail network, constructed between 1950 and 1990 with bituminous
waterproofing systems or without any waterproofing, are reaching the threshold where water
ingress compromises the concrete structure and demands intervention. Membriko offers diagnostic
and rehabilitation services for these existing tunnels, including EPDM installation following
concrete repair, drainage channel lining, and sump waterproofing.

---

## Maintenance and Inspection of Tunnel Waterproofing

The practical advantage of compartmentalisation and injection ports is not only technical — it
is operational. A tunnel with a compartmentalised EPDM waterproofing system can be monitored
and remediated without interrupting normal operations, unlike non-compartmentalised systems
where significant ingress may require full tunnel closure.

### Ongoing Monitoring

Membriko recommends the following monitoring practices for tunnels with EPDM systems:

**Drainage flow measurement:** The drain flows from each compartment should be measured
periodically. A sudden increase in flow from one specific drain zone indicates activation of
a compartment — which may indicate a point membrane defect or a rise in the groundwater table.
Comparison of flow rates between compartments allows the affected zone to be identified with
precision.

**Visual inspection of the secondary lining interior:** The secondary concrete lining is the
visual indicator of membrane performance. Efflorescence (calcium carbonate crystallisation),
damp staining, and calcite deposits on the interior concrete surface indicate that groundwater
is penetrating and migrating through the concrete. The location of these manifestations on the
inner tunnel wall indicates the compartment of origin.

**Injection port pressure testing:** Periodic pressurisation of injection ports with air or
water allows compartment integrity to be confirmed without injecting any material. This test
should be carried out at least once every five years of operation.

### Injection Remediation

When a compartment with active water ingress is identified, Membriko offers an injection
remediation service:

1. Confirmation of the affected compartment by pressure testing of adjacent injection ports
2. Selection of injection material: micro-fine cement grout (for compartments with moderate
   void volume) or hydro-expanding polyurethane foam (for compartments with active ingress
   during injection)
3. Progressive injection through the ports, monitoring pressure and volume injected
4. Sealing confirmation: pressure test after injection material cure

Remediation work is carried out from inside the tunnel, with no excavation or operational
interruption, and typically completed within one to three days per compartment.

## Regulations — EN 13491, EN 13967, Eurocodes 7 and 8

### EN 13491 — The Central Standard

EN 13491 (Geosynthetic barriers — Characteristics required for use in the construction of tunnels
and underground structures) is the normative reference document for tunnel waterproofing with
geomembrane. It defines:

- Performance classes A to D with corresponding hydrostatic pressure requirements
- Mechanical resistance tests relevant to tunnel installation (CBR static puncture, trapezoidal
  tear, tensile strength and elongation)
- Durability and chemical resistance requirements specific to buried contact with the project
  geology and groundwater
- Quality control methods for seams and required documentation

Membriko issues an EN 13491 conformity declaration for every tunnel waterproofing project,
specifying the performance class achieved.

### EN 13967 — CE Marking of the Product

EN 13967 is the European product standard for flexible plastic and rubber waterproofing sheets
used below ground and in foundations. It defines the requirements for the mandatory CE marking
of the EPDM membranes used by Membriko. Certified product tests include: tensile strength,
elongation, tear resistance, dimensional stability, and accelerated durability.

### Eurocode 7 — Geotechnical Design

Eurocode 7 (EN 1997) defines the geotechnical investigation requirements, the methodology for
determining the design groundwater level, and the criteria for sizing drainage and waterproofing
systems in geotechnical structures. Membriko bases the EN 13491 class specification on the
design groundwater level values determined in accordance with EC7.

### Eurocode 8 — Seismic Design

Eurocode 8 (EN 1998) is particularly relevant in Portugal, one of the most seismically active
countries in Western Europe. The Portuguese National Annex (NP EN 1998-1) defines the seismic
zones (1.1 to 1.6 in the south/Algarve region, 2.1 to 2.6 in the north) and the design peak
ground acceleration values. EPDM expansion joints for tunnels are sized based on the differential
displacement calculated per EC8 for the seismic zones traversed by the alignment.

---

## Seismic Design and EPDM Expansion Joints

Portugal is one of the most seismically active countries in Western Europe. The 1755 Lisbon
earthquake (estimated magnitude ~8.5-9.0 Mw) and the ongoing seismic activity of the
Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone define the seismic design context for buried infrastructure
in Portugal.

### Where the Seismic Risk Lies in Tunnel Waterproofing

The seismic risk for tunnel waterproofing does not reside in the typical running tunnel section —
the lining rings of a bored tunnel move together with the surrounding ground, producing no
significant relative deformation. The risk lies at the interfaces:

- **Tunnel-to-station:** The station is a massive, rigid reinforced concrete box; the tunnel is
  a relatively more flexible structure. During a seismic event, the two elements move differently.
  The connecting membrane must accommodate this differential displacement without tearing.
- **Tunnel-to-access shaft:** The same logic applies to ventilation shafts, access shafts, and
  junction chambers.
- **Tunnel portal:** The transition between the buried tunnel section and the portal structure
  above ground is a zone of significant differential seismic displacement.

### EPDM Expansion Joint Detail

Membriko designs EPDM expansion joints with a bellows geometry for all these critical interfaces.
The operating principle:

1. A strip of EPDM of additional width (typically 300-600 mm beyond the covering requirement of
   the joint) is formed into a controlled fold — the "bellows"
2. Under normal service conditions, the bellows is at rest and not under load
3. In a seismic event, the bellows unfolds to accommodate the differential displacement
4. Beyond the bellows deformation, the EPDM material itself contributes its 300-500% elongation
   as an additional reserve
5. The result is a joint capable of accommodating 50-100 mm of differential displacement without
   rupture or loss of watertightness

Design displacements are calculated based on the peak ground acceleration defined by NP EN 1998-1
for the project seismic zone and for the structure's importance class. Membriko submits expansion
joint calculations for review by the structural designer before any installation.

**What EN 13491 class is appropriate for a tunnel with the water table 15 m above the invert?**

15 m of water head corresponds to approximately 150 kPa of hydrostatic pressure. This falls
within EN 13491 Class C (up to 200 kPa). Membriko specifies 2.5 mm EPDM as the standard
thickness for Class C applications, with additional seam reinforcement at concrete construction
joints.

**Does EPDM withstand contact with fresh sprayed concrete (shotcrete)?**

Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to the alkaline environment of fresh and curing shotcrete (pH
typically 12-13). The protection geotextile installed between the EPDM and the primary shotcrete
lining additionally protects the membrane from the mechanical impact energy of shotcrete spray.

**How are EPDM seam joints verified before secondary lining concrete is poured?**

Membriko performs systematic metal probe testing — a metal probe instrument is run along every
seam to detect any unbonded areas. All seams are also visually inspected and photographically
recorded. For critical projects, air lance testing of lap seams can be specified as an additional
QA measure. The photographic record forms part of the as-built documentation package delivered
to the client.

**What is the difference between pre-applied and post-applied EPDM in cut-and-cover tunnels?**

In pre-application, the membrane is secured to the excavation face before the structural concrete
is poured — concrete is in direct contact with the EPDM during casting, eliminating the gap
between membrane and concrete. In post-application, the membrane is applied to the outer face
of the hardened concrete before backfill, allowing full inspection of the installed membrane.
Pre-application eliminates the groundwater tracking risk at point defects; post-application
allows complete visual inspection during installation. Membriko advises on the most appropriate
variant for each project.

**Is EPDM compatible with tunnel drainage systems?**

Yes. EPDM is chemically compatible with the HDPE and PP drainage pipes, polypropylene geocomposite
drainage layers, and HDPE drainage sheets used in tunnel drainage systems. At penetrations where
drainage pipes pass through the EPDM membrane, Membriko installs pre-formed EPDM sleeve details
with certified mechanical compression seals.

**What warranty does Membriko provide for tunnel waterproofing?**

Membriko provides a 10-year installation warranty as standard for tunnel waterproofing projects,
extendable to 20 years for projects with inspection access provisions. This warranty is
supplementary to the EN 13491-compliant membrane product guarantee and to the statutory defects
liability periods applicable under Portuguese civil and public procurement law. For public
infrastructure projects, Membriko issues a warranty bond on request from the infrastructure owner.

**Can EPDM be used for rehabilitation of existing tunnels with degraded waterproofing?**

Yes — rehabilitation is a growing area of Membriko's tunnel activity. Membriko installs EPDM
in existing tunnel structures following concrete repair and surface preparation. In cut-and-cover
tunnels with accessible external faces, the original waterproofing can be replaced with EPDM
during major renovation works with partial excavation. In bored tunnels with double linings,
rehabilitation typically focuses on compartment injection grouting and drainage system relining
rather than membrane replacement. Membriko offers diagnostic inspections and rehabilitation
programmes for existing tunnel infrastructure.

**How does Membriko approach the interface between the tunnel and adjacent rigid structures?**

These interfaces are the highest-risk waterproofing joints in any tunnel project. Membriko
designs dedicated EPDM expansion joint details — including formed bellows with defined movement
accommodation capacity — for all tunnel-to-rigid-structure interfaces. The joint is sized to
accommodate the differential displacement demand from both seismic analysis (EN 1998) and
differential settlement analysis (EN 1997). All expansion joint details are fabricated and
pre-tested before installation on site.
