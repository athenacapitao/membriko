# Tunnels — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Tunnel waterproofing is a specialist civil engineering application that sits firmly at the
premium end of the EPDM market. The audiences for this page are meaningfully different from
those for roofing or pool pages:

1. **Civil engineers and structural designers** specifying waterproofing systems for new tunnel
   projects — they require technical authority, reference to EN standards, and confidence that
   Membriko understands the specific demands of tunnel hydrostatics and seismic design
2. **Infrastructure owners and concessionaires** (Infraestruturas de Portugal, Brisa, Metro do
   Porto, Metro de Lisboa, municipal câmaras) procuring waterproofing for maintenance and
   rehabilitation of existing tunnel structures — they need reliability evidence, warranty
   terms and case study context
3. **Main contractors and specialist subcontractors** on tunnel projects — they need installation
   process clarity, product specification sheets, and confidence in Membriko's capacity to
   supply and support at project scale

The persuasion architecture for this page differs from consumer applications. Technical
authority is the primary persuasion lever — the reader must believe that Membriko understands
tunnel waterproofing at the level of the standard-setters. The secondary lever is risk reduction:
tunnel waterproofing defects are extremely expensive to remediate once the structure is closed
and backfilled. A trusted, experienced supplier with a defined process and a strong warranty
eliminates the category of risk that procurement teams most fear.

Portugal's active tunnel construction programme (Ferrovia 2020, Alta Velocidade, ongoing metro
extensions in Porto and Lisbon, plus road tunnel rehabilitation) provides a compelling context
frame that positions this page as timely and market-relevant.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Tunnel Infrastructure and Waterproofing Stakes

**Purpose:** Establish the scale and importance of tunnel waterproofing in the Portuguese
infrastructure context; frame the consequences of failure; position Membriko as the specialist
solution.

**Content:**
- Open with the scale of Portuguese tunnel infrastructure: from the metro tunnels under Lisbon
  and Porto to the mountain road tunnels of Marão and Gardunha, from the planned high-speed
  rail tunnels to the rehabilitation of 20th-century rail tunnels across the country
- Frame the stakes: unlike a roof, a tunnel membrane cannot be inspected or replaced without
  excavating or demolishing the secondary structure. It must work for 100 years, under sustained
  hydrostatic pressure, through seismic events, and through the concrete's structural life.
- Position Membriko's EPDM system as the solution engineered for this permanence requirement:
  100+ year service life, EN 13491 classification, geomembrane specialist expertise
- Stat block: 100+ years service life / Class D hydrostatic resistance (400+ kPa) / EN 13491
  certified / seismic accommodation design
- Primary CTA: "Consultar Projecto de Impermeabilização de Túnel"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Tunnel Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the chemistry and physics argument for EPDM in the
tunnel environment.

**Content:**
- The three fundamental demands of tunnel waterproofing: sustained hydrostatic pressure
  resistance, chemical resistance to groundwater over a 100-year design life, and mechanical
  accommodation of structural deformation
- EPDM's saturated polymer backbone and its immunity to groundwater chemistry across the
  range of Portuguese geology (granites, schists, limestones, marls, clays)
- 300-500% elongation as the mechanical safety margin for differential settlement, seismic
  movement, and thermal expansion at portals
- No plasticiser degradation mechanism: EPDM's performance is intrinsic, not dependent on
  additives that deplete over the 100-year design life
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness (cut-and-cover) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Thickness (bored tunnel) | 2.0-3.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Hydrostatic resistance | > 400 kPa | EN 13491 / EN 1928 |
  | Groundwater pH range | 3.5 to 12 | Chemical immersion |
  | Service life | 100+ years | EN 13491 / Arrhenius |

## Section 3: Tunnel Types — Cut-and-Cover, Bored, Immersed

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko's EPDM solution is technically appropriate for every
tunnel construction method used in Portugal.

**Content:** Three tunnel type cards.

**Cut-and-Cover Tunnels:**
- Context: urban metro stations, road underpasses, underground structures in shallow terrain;
  open excavation with concrete structure built in the cut and backfilled over
- EPDM benefit: fully wrapped tanking system; pre-applied or post-applied; eliminates the
  groundwater tracking risk that besets injection-based waterproofing at construction joints
- Compartmentalisation note: batten bar system divides the membrane-to-structure interface
  into sealed zones; any defect is confined and injectable without demolition

**Bored and NATM Tunnels:**
- Context: tunnels driven by TBM or sequential excavation; typical double-lining system with
  primary shotcrete, EPDM geomembrane, and secondary cast concrete lining
- EPDM benefit: 2.0-3.0 mm membrane installed on geotextile protection layer over primary
  lining; fully encased in secondary lining concrete; seams formed in accessible conditions
  before concrete pour
- EN 13491 Class C/D specification for demanding hydrostatic conditions

**Immersed Tube Tunnels:**
- Context: pre-fabricated concrete tube sections floated, sunk, and connected under water;
  used for river and estuary crossings
- EPDM benefit: applied to pre-fabricated segments in controlled fabrication yard conditions;
  superior quality control vs in-situ installation; sustained hydrostatic resistance at
  depth (EN 13491 Class D)

## Section 4: Hydrostatic Pressure Resistance

**Purpose:** Address the single most critical technical requirement for tunnel waterproofing,
with specific data and EN 13491 classification context.

**Content:**
- Explanation of hydrostatic pressure in the tunnel context: how groundwater table depth
  translates to kPa pressure on the membrane
- EN 13491 performance classes (Class A through D) with pressure ranges and which tunnel
  types correspond to each class
- EPDM performance data: 2.0 mm EPDM at Class C (200 kPa); 2.5-3.0 mm at Class D (400+ kPa)
- Portuguese geological context: specific formations and their groundwater pressure implications
  (granite highlands, Tagus alluvium, limestone karst, urban fill)
- Joint design for hydrostatic loading: how EPDM lap seams are designed and tested to maintain
  integrity under sustained pressure equal to the parent membrane
- Comparison note: PVC membranes at equivalent thickness have comparable hydrostatic resistance
  but inferior long-term chemical resistance (plasticiser extraction) and worse fire safety
  profile (HCl generation)

## Section 5: Installation Process (8 Steps)

**Purpose:** De-risk the specification decision by making the Membriko installation process
feel systematic, quality-assured, and appropriate for high-stakes civil engineering applications.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Análise do Projecto e Especificação** — Review of project design documents, geotechnical
   report and groundwater data; confirmation of EN 13491 performance class required; membrane
   thickness and seam configuration specification; geotextile protection layer selection

2. **Plano de Instalação e Compartimentação** — Layout plan for membrane panels; compartment
   grid design with batten bar intervals; injection port positions; drainage channel design;
   definition of critical joints (tunnel-to-station, expansion joints, construction joints)

3. **Preparação da Superfície de Suporte** — Primary lining inspection and surface preparation;
   grinding of protrusions and sharp edges; localised crack repair with cementitious or
   polyurethane mortar; geotextile protection layer installation

4. **Instalação da Geomembrana EPDM** — Panel installation from invert to crown; mechanical
   fixing with batten bars at defined centres; lap configuration with minimum 150 mm overlap;
   crown panels installed with positive mechanical support to prevent sagging before secondary
   concrete

5. **Formação de Emendas e Selagem** — QuickSeam tape and primer application; seam pressing
   with silicone roller; seam probe testing to confirm integrity; critical joint reinforcement
   with additional EPDM strip

6. **Pontos Singulares e Juntas de Expansão** — Waterproofing of penetrations (drainage pipes,
   monitoring cables, ventilation ducts); expansion joint bellows details at tunnel-to-station
   interfaces; EPDM reinforced cuffs around all penetrations

7. **Compartimentação e Portos de Injecção** — Batten bar welding to create compartments;
   injection port installation in each compartment; photographic record of all compartments
   before secondary lining pour

   seam probe testing; photographic as-built record; integrity test where specified; handover
   documentation package with certification, installation record and Membriko warranty

---

## Section 6: Compartmentalisation and Leak Management

**Purpose:** Explain the advanced design feature that distinguishes a professional tunnel
waterproofing system from a simple sheet membrane installation, and demonstrate that Membriko
designs to manage the consequences of any defect that might occur.

**Content:**
- The problem with non-compartmentalised tunnel waterproofing: if water finds a pinhole defect,
  it can track across the entire membrane-to-concrete interface and emerge at unexpected and
  often inaccessible locations
- The compartment principle: batten bar strips divide the waterproofing plane into discrete
  sealed cells; water entering any cell is confined to that cell and cannot spread
- Injection remediation: each compartment includes an injection port; if water ingress is
  detected (by drainage flow measurement or visual inspection), the affected compartment can
  be grouted from inside the tunnel without any excavation or demolition
- Cost of remediation comparison: compartmentalised system allows targeted injection repair
  costing thousands vs. excavation and lining demolition costing millions for non-
  compartmentalised failures
- Membriko's compartment design: standard 5 m x 5 m compartment grid for cut-and-cover
  tunnels; 3 m ring spacing for bored tunnel applications

## Section 7: EPDM vs PVC / Bentonite / Cementitious Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Provide an honest comparative analysis that positions EPDM correctly against
alternatives without dismissing legitimate competing technologies.

**Content:** Comparison table with 8 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | PVC Sheet | Bentonite GCL | Cementitious |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 100+ years | 50-80 years (plasticiser loss) | 50+ years (if confined) | 20-40 years |
| Hydrostatic resistance | Class D (400+ kPa) | Class D (400+ kPa) | Class B (limited) | Good (intact concrete only) |
| Elongation / crack bridging | 300-500% | 200-300% | Self-healing (micro) | None |
| Fire safety | Low toxicity combustion | HCl generation (toxic) | Non-combustible | Non-combustible |
| Chemical resistance | pH 3.5-12, all Portuguese geology | pH 4-12 (plasticiser limits) | pH 7-11 (ionic sensitive) | Dependent on concrete |
| Compartmentalisation | Yes — batten bar system | Yes — batten bar system | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| Repair without excavation | Yes — injection through ports | Yes — injection through ports | No | Limited injection possible |
| Seismic accommodation | Excellent — 300%+ elongation | Moderate | Poor | None |

Honest comparative note: PVC sheet membranes are a legitimate competing technology in European
tunnel waterproofing with an excellent track record, particularly in projects where heat-welded
dual seams with air channel testing are specified as the QA method. Membriko's position is that
EPDM's superior fire safety (no halogen combustion gases), higher elongation capacity, and
absence of plasticiser degradation make it the preferred choice for tunnels with 100-year design
lives, seismic exposure, or complex ground chemistry. For short-design-life structures or
projects where the dual-channel seam testing protocol is a mandatory QA requirement, PVC may
be appropriate.

## Section 8: Fire Safety in Tunnels

**Purpose:** Address the fire safety dimension of tunnel waterproofing — a critical concern
for road and rail tunnels but often overlooked in specifications that focus only on hydrostatic
performance.

**Content:**
- Why fire safety matters in tunnels: tunnel fires (Mont Blanc 1999, Fréjus 2005) drove major
  revisions to tunnel safety standards across Europe; material choice affects smoke toxicity,
  fire spread rate, and emergency response effectiveness
- EPDM vs PVC in fire: EPDM combustion products primarily CO₂ and H₂O; PVC generates HCl
  gas (highly toxic, immediately life-threatening) and carcinogenic dioxins; halogen-free is
  a genuine safety advantage
- EN 13501-1 classifications: Euroclass D-E for standard EPDM; halogen-free low-smoke EPDM
  formulations available for critical life-safety tunnels (Euroclass C or D with low smoke
  opacity)
- Application context: in bored tunnels with double lining, the membrane is encased between
  primary and secondary lining concrete; direct fire exposure is unlikely but secondary lining
  concrete spalling in fires can expose the membrane
- Membriko specification note: halogen-free EPDM formulation is standard for all public-access
  tunnels (road, rail, metro); standard formulation for service tunnels and drainage galleries

## Section 10: Portuguese Tunnel Projects and Market Context

**Purpose:** Provide market context that demonstrates Membriko's awareness of the Portuguese
tunnel infrastructure programme and positions Membriko as active in this sector.

**Content:**
- Overview of Portuguese tunnel infrastructure investment: Ferrovia 2020, PNI 2030, Alta
  Velocidade, metro extensions
- Key tunnel projects where EPDM waterproofing is or will be the appropriate system:
  - Metro do Porto and Metro de Lisboa extension works
  - High-speed rail tunnels (Campanhã-Soure section, Évora-Caia section)
  - Road tunnel rehabilitation (ageing EN and IC tunnels built before 1990)
  - Municipal infrastructure: drainage tunnels, underground car parks, utility galleries
- The rehabilitation market: Portugal's oldest tunnel infrastructure (Douro valley rail
  tunnels, some dating to the 19th century) and the intermediate stock of 1970s-1990s
  cut-and-cover tunnels with degraded bituminous waterproofing requiring EPDM replacement

---

## Section 11: Maintenance and Inspection of Tunnel Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Address the long-term asset management dimension that infrastructure owners care
about — particularly the ability to detect and remediate defects without major works.

**Content:**
- Visual inspection from inside the tunnel: drainage flow rates, visible seepage staining,
  efflorescence patterns on secondary lining — all indirect indicators of membrane performance
- Compartment monitoring: injection port pressure testing to identify compartments with active
  water ingress before they cause secondary lining deterioration
- Grouting remediation procedure: when a compartment is identified with water ingress, the
  Membriko process for injection grouting — cement micro-fine or PU foam — through the installed
  ports, without any structural demolition
- Membrane inspection at exposed details: portals, expansion joints, drainage sumps — areas
  where the membrane may be partially exposed and subject to direct inspection
- Membriko's maintenance support: technical inspection service for tunnel clients; injection
  grouting remediation service; warranty claim process

---

## Section 12: Regulations — EN 13491, EN 13967, Eurocode 7 and 8

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko designs to the applicable European standards for tunnel
geomembranes and seismic design.

**Content:**
- EN 13491: Geosynthetic barriers — characteristics required for use in the construction of
  tunnels and underground structures; performance classes A-D; how Membriko specifies and
  tests to the required class for each project
- EN 13967: Flexible sheets for waterproofing — plastic and rubber sheets for waterproofing
  below ground; CE marking requirements; the distinction between EN 13967 (product standard)
  and EN 13491 (application performance standard)
- EN 1997 (Eurocode 7 — Geotechnical Design): groundwater level assessment, geotechnical
  investigation requirements, drainage design requirements; how the geotechnical report informs
  the EN 13491 class specification

  acceleration values; implications for expansion joint EPDM detail design
- Portuguese procurement context: Infraestruturas de Portugal technical specifications;
  LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) certification requirements

---

## Section 13: Seismic Design and EPDM Expansion Joints

**Purpose:** Address the specifically Portuguese challenge of seismic design for tunnel
waterproofing — differentiating Membriko from general waterproofing contractors who do not
design for seismic accommodation.

**Content:**
- Portugal's seismic context: one of the highest seismic hazard zones in Western Europe;
  1755 Lisbon earthquake as historical reference; current Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone
  activity; ANPC (Autoridade Nacional de Proteção Civil) seismic risk mapping
- The critical waterproofing joint: tunnel-to-station, tunnel-to-shaft, tunnel-to-portal —
  the interfaces between flexible tunnel lining and rigid connected structures are the
  locations of maximum differential seismic displacement
- EPDM expansion detail design: bellows geometry providing 50-100 mm of accommodated
  movement; the role of EPDM's 300-500% elongation as the reserve beyond the bellows
- Design methodology: calculation of displacement demand at critical joints based on EN 1998
  seismic zones; specification of bellows geometry and EPDM strip width to accommodate
  the calculated demand
- Membriko's seismic joint detail: pre-formed EPDM bellows with welded connections to main
  membrane; tested to defined cyclic displacement protocol before installation

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail technical and procurement search intent; reduce pre-qualification
query volume.

1. **Qual a classe EN 13491 adequada para um túnel com nível freático a 15 m acima da soleira?**
   15 m of water head corresponds to approximately 150 kPa hydrostatic pressure. This falls
   within EN 13491 Class C (up to 200 kPa). Membriko specifies 2.5 mm EPDM for Class C
   applications as standard, with additional seam reinforcement at construction joints.

2. **O EPDM aguenta o contato com betão projetado (gunite/shotcrete) fresco?**
   Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to the alkaline environment of fresh and curing shotcrete
   (pH typically 12-13). The geotextile protection layer installed between the EPDM and
   the primary shotcrete lining also protects the membrane from the mechanical impact of
   fresh shotcrete spray.

3. **Como se verifica a integridade das emendas EPDM antes de betonar o revestimento secundário?**
   Membriko performs systematic seam probe testing — a metal probe is run along every
   seam to detect any unbonded areas. Additionally, all seams are inspected visually under
   magnification and photographically recorded. For critical projects, air lance testing
   of lap seams can be specified. The photographic record forms part of the as-built
   documentation package.

4. **Qual a diferença entre membrana EPDM pré-aplicada e pós-aplicada em túnel de vala coberta?**
   Pre-applied EPDM is fixed to the excavation face or sheet pile/piled wall before the
   structural concrete is poured. Concrete bonds to the EPDM surface during pour, creating
   an intimate composite. Post-applied EPDM is applied to the external face of the completed
   concrete structure before backfill. Pre-applied eliminates the gap between membrane and
   concrete (removing the water tracking risk) but requires more careful installation
   sequencing with the main concrete contractor.

5. **O EPDM é compatível com sistemas de drenagem de túnel (tubagens, geotêxteis drenantes)?**
   Yes. EPDM is chemically compatible with the polyethylene (PE) drainage pipes, polypropylene
   (PP) geotextile drainage composites, and HDPE drainage sheets commonly used in tunnel
   drainage systems. At penetrations where drainage pipes pass through the EPDM membrane,
   Membriko installs pre-formed EPDM sleeve details with mechanically clamped seals.

6. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para impermeabilização de túneis?**
   Membriko provides a 10-year installation warranty as standard for tunnel waterproofing
   projects, extendable to 20 years for projects with inspection access provisions. This is
   supplementary to the EN 13491-compliant membrane product warranty and to the statutory
   defects liability period under the Portuguese Código Civil and Regime Jurídico da Empreitada
   de Obras Públicas (RJEOP). For public infrastructure projects, Membriko provides a
   warranty bond on request.

7. **O EPDM pode ser utilizado em reabilitação de túneis existentes com revestimento degradado?**
   Yes — rehabilitation is a growing application. Membriko installs EPDM in existing tunnel
   structures after concrete repair and surface preparation. The approach depends on the
   specific tunnel configuration: in cut-and-cover tunnels with accessible external faces, the
   original waterproofing can be replaced from outside during major renovation works; in bored
   tunnels with double lining, rehabilitation typically focuses on injection grouting of the
   existing membrane interface and drain relining rather than membrane replacement.

8. **Como a Membriko aborda a interface entre o túnel e as estruturas rígidas adjacentes (estações, poços)?**
   These interfaces are the highest-risk waterproofing joints in any tunnel project. Membriko
   designs dedicated EPDM expansion joint details — including formed bellows with defined
   movement accommodation capacity — at all tunnel-to-structure interfaces. The detail is
   calculated to accommodate the differential displacement demand specified by the seismic
   design (EN 1998) and the expected differential settlement from the geotechnical analysis.
   All expansion joint details are fabricated and pre-tested before installation.
