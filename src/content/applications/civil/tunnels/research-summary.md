# Tunnels — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Tunnel Waterproofing: Core Chemistry and Structural Relevance

Tunnel waterproofing is among the most technically demanding applications in civil engineering.
The membrane is inaccessible after construction, operates under sustained hydrostatic pressure
that can reach hundreds of kilopascals, and must remain functional for the 100+ year design life
of the tunnel structure. EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) sheet membrane is one of the
two dominant technologies in European tunnel waterproofing — the other being PVC sheet — and
has accumulated a substantial body of performance data over 40+ years of service in cut-and-cover
and bored tunnel construction.

The fundamental suitability of EPDM for tunnel waterproofing derives from the same molecular
architecture that makes it the preferred material for demanding flat roofing and water retention
applications: the saturated carbon-carbon backbone of the EPDM polymer chain is chemically inert
to groundwater chemistry across the full range encountered in civil engineering practice — from
acidic peat-laden groundwater in upland terrain to alkaline groundwater in limestone and carbonate
geology, from slightly aggressive CO₂-saturated groundwater to sulfate-bearing groundwater in
urban fill.

Tunnel-grade EPDM is typically formulated with:
- Ethylene content: 50-70% molar, biased toward higher ethylene for mechanical strength
- ENB (ethylidene norbornene) diene content: 3-6% molar, providing cross-linking sites
- Carbon black loading: 40-55 phr (primary UV absorber and mechanical reinforcement)
- Accelerated sulphur vulcanisation package optimised for long-term compression set resistance
- Antioxidant and heat stabiliser packages appropriate for buried service at ambient ground
  temperatures

Key physical properties relevant to tunnel applications:
- Service temperature range: -45°C to +120°C (continuous); no practical relevance for buried
  tunnels where ground temperatures are typically 10-18°C in Portugal
- Elongation at break: 300-500% — critical for bridging substrate cracks and accommodating
  structural settlement
- Tensile strength: 9-14 N/mm² depending on formulation and thickness
- Hydrostatic resistance: tested to EN 1928 Method B; tunnel-grade EPDM passes at pressures
  exceeding 400 kPa (40 m head) without penetration
- Puncture resistance: significantly higher than PVC of equivalent thickness due to EPDM's
  elastomeric tear arrest mechanism
- Compression set (permanent deformation under sustained load): < 25% after 72 hours at 70°C
  — important for lap joint integrity under sustained hydrostatic pressure

## Hydrostatic Pressure and Groundwater Chemistry

### Pressure Regimes in Portuguese Tunnels

Tunnel waterproofing membranes operate under hydrostatic pressure from the groundwater table
above and around the tunnel structure. This pressure varies widely:

- Shallow cut-and-cover urban tunnels (metro, road underpasses): typically 0-30 kPa (0-3 m
  water head); low hydrostatic demand but high risk of differential settlement cracking
- Deeper cut-and-cover structures (underground stations, deep road tunnels): 30-150 kPa
  (3-15 m head); moderate hydrostatic demand requiring careful joint design
- Bored tunnels under rivers and estuaries: 100-400 kPa (10-40 m head); high hydrostatic
  demand requiring premium membrane specification and robust joint systems
- Immersed tube tunnels (crossing rivers or estuaries): up to 600 kPa (60 m equivalent head
  in deep crossings); exceptional hydrostatic demand; EPDM used for pre-applied waterproofing
  to prefabricated segments

Portuguese tunnel infrastructure includes several demanding hydrostatic scenarios:
- Metro do Porto tunnels passing beneath the Douro catchment and urban groundwater zones
- Lisbon Metro extensions under the Tagus valley quaternary alluvium with high water tables
- Road tunnels in the Serra da Estrela, Gerês and Arrábida ranges with fracture-controlled
  groundwater in granite and schist
- Rail tunnels of the Variante de Alcácer and planned high-speed rail lines crossing multiple
  geological formations

### Groundwater Chemistry Challenges

EPDM's chemical resistance to groundwater is effectively universal within the pH range 3.5-12,
covering all natural groundwater compositions encountered in Portuguese geology:

- Acidic granite and schist terrains (pH 4.5-6.5, Serra da Estrela, Minho): EPDM fully stable
- Limestone karst groundwater (pH 7.5-8.5, Algarve, Alentejo karst): EPDM fully stable
- Urban contaminated groundwater with chlorinated solvents, petroleum hydrocarbons: EPDM
  resistant to aliphatic hydrocarbons and most chlorinated solvents at groundwater concentrations
- Sulfate-bearing groundwater (urban fill, marine clays, evaporite geology): EPDM fully stable;
  sulfate is a primary cause of concrete deterioration but does not attack EPDM's polymer chain

## Tunnel Types and Waterproofing Strategy

### Cut-and-Cover Tunnels

Cut-and-cover construction involves excavating a trench or open cut, constructing the tunnel
structure within the excavation, and backfilling over it. This method is used for:
- Urban metro stations and interchange structures where depth permits open excavation
- Road underpasses and grade-separated crossings
- Underground car parks, utility corridors, and service tunnels
- Railway tunnels in shallow urban terrain

Waterproofing strategy for cut-and-cover tunnels:

**Tanking (fully wrapped) system:** The preferred approach for structures below the permanent
groundwater table. The complete external surface of the concrete structure — walls, slab,
roof — is wrapped in a continuous EPDM membrane. The membrane can be applied pre-cast
(pre-applied to the formwork or piling before concrete pour) or post-applied (to the completed
external concrete surface before backfill).

Pre-applied EPDM (also termed "pre-applied blanket" or "pre-cast" waterproofing):
- EPDM sheet is secured to the formation face (piled wall or excavation face) before the
  structural concrete is poured
- The concrete bonds to the EPDM during pour, creating a composite assembly
- Eliminates the gap between membrane and concrete that is present in post-applied systems
- Compartmentalises water paths — in the event of a pinhole defect, water cannot track
  between membrane and concrete to remote locations

Post-applied EPDM:
- Applied to the completed concrete structure before backfill
- Simpler to inspect during application and easier to repair detected defects
- Requires more careful design of lap joints at the junction between wall and roof slab
  where construction joints in the concrete create the highest waterproofing risk
- The Membriko approach for post-applied tunnel waterproofing uses fully adhered EPDM
  with defined overlap seams and mechanical fixing at the termination zones

### Bored and Mined Tunnels

Bored tunnels are constructed using tunnel boring machines (TBMs) or by NATM (New Austrian
Tunnelling Method / sequential excavation method). The structural lining typically consists of:

**Segmental concrete lining (TBM tunnels):**
Pre-cast concrete segments are erected immediately behind the TBM cutterhead. The segments
are bolted together with EPDM or EPDM/neoprene rubber gaskets in the circumferential and
longitudinal joints. These gaskets are the primary waterproofing system for segmental linings,
with the concrete segment itself as the secondary barrier. EPDM gaskets in segmental tunnel
linings are standardised under EN 681-1 (elastomeric seals for water supply, drainage, and
sewerage pipelines) and specific tunnel gasket standards.

**Cast-in-place secondary lining (NATM and bored tunnels with secondary lining):**
Many bored tunnels use a double-lining system:
1. Primary lining: sprayed concrete (shotcrete) applied directly to the excavated profile
2. Waterproofing membrane: applied over the primary lining on smooth geotextile backing
3. Secondary lining: cast-in-place reinforced concrete cast against the waterproofing membrane

The EPDM membrane in this system (the most common configuration in European rail and road
tunnels) is installed by specialist contractors working from the primary lining inward. The
membrane is mechanically fixed to the primary lining with plastic batten bars and disc fixings
at defined intervals, creating a free-hanging sheet that is then encased by the secondary lining
concrete pour.

EPDM thickness specifications for bored tunnel secondary lining applications:
- Standard rail tunnel: 2.0 mm EPDM (EN 13491 Class B or Class C)
- Heavy rail and metro tunnel: 2.5 mm EPDM (EN 13491 Class C or Class D)
- Road tunnel with demanding hydrostatic conditions: 2.5-3.0 mm EPDM

### Immersed Tube Tunnels

Immersed tube tunnels are constructed by pre-fabricating concrete tube sections in a dry dock
or fabrication yard, floating them to the crossing location, sinking them into a pre-dredged
trench, and connecting them at depth. This method is used for river and estuary crossings.

EPDM waterproofing for immersed tubes is typically applied to the pre-fabricated concrete
elements in the fabrication yard before the tubes are floated and installed. The combination of
pre-application quality control with the accessibility of a fabrication yard setting, and the
long-term hydrostatic performance of EPDM, makes this a reliable waterproofing strategy.

## Compartmentalization and Leak Management

A defining advantage of EPDM sheet membrane systems over injection-based (cementitious or
crystalline) waterproofing in tunnels is the ability to design for compartmentalisation: the
principle that a localised defect in the waterproofing membrane does not result in uncontrolled
water ingress across the entire structure.

EPDM compartmentalisation is achieved by:
1. **Waterstop/batten bar strips:** Strips of EPDM or compatible waterstop material are heat-
   welded to the main membrane at defined intervals (typically 3-6 m) and mechanically fixed
   to the primary lining. These strips divide the membrane-to-primary-lining space into
   discrete cells. If a defect occurs, water ingress is confined to that compartment.
2. **Injection ports:** Each compartment can include an injection port allowing grouting of the
   compartment with micro-fine cement or polyurethane if a defect is identified. This enables
   repair without demolishing the secondary lining — critically important for operational tunnels.
3. **Surface channel drainage:** The inner face of the primary lining may include drainage
   channels that collect and route any water that passes through membrane defects to defined
   drainage points, preventing unexpected seepage into the tunnel interior.

## EN 13491 Standard — Geosynthetics for Underground Waterproofing

EN 13491 is the primary European standard for geosynthetic barriers used in waterproofing of
underground structures including tunnels. It classifies geosynthetic barriers (including EPDM
sheet membranes) into performance classes based on their resistance to hydrostatic pressure
and mechanical damage during installation:

**EN 13491 Performance Classes:**
- Class A: hydrostatic pressure resistance ≤ 50 kPa — low pressure (very shallow structures)
- Class B: hydrostatic pressure resistance up to 100 kPa — moderate pressure (most cut-and-
  cover structures in typical groundwater conditions)
- Class C: hydrostatic pressure resistance up to 200 kPa — high pressure (deep cut-and-cover,
  bored tunnels under significant groundwater tables)
- Class D: hydrostatic pressure resistance up to 400 kPa and above — very high pressure
  (tunnels under rivers and estuaries, deep bored tunnels)

EPDM membranes at 2.0-3.0 mm thickness readily achieve EN 13491 Class C and Class D under
standardised testing.

Additional EN 13491 requirements relevant to tunnel EPDM:
- Seam strength: 100% of parent membrane strength for welded seams
- Long-term pressure resistance: tested at design pressure for defined durations
- Chemical resistance: resistance to groundwater chemicals specific to the project geology
- Resistance to installation damage: controlled drop tests simulating primary lining irregularity

### EN 13967 — Flexible Sheets for Waterproofing

EN 13967 specifies requirements for plastic and rubber flexible sheets used for waterproofing
below ground and in foundations. For EPDM:
- Minimum tensile strength: 9 N/mm² (EPDM typically 9-14 N/mm²)
- Minimum elongation at break: 300% (EPDM typically 300-500%)
- Resistance to static puncture (CBR test): defined minimum force per thickness
- Dimensional stability: ≤ 2% change after thermal conditioning
- Water vapour resistance: defined µ·d values for vapour control function

## EPDM vs PVC Sheet Membrane in Tunnel Applications

Both EPDM and PVC sheet membranes are widely used in European tunnel waterproofing. The choice
between them is a genuine technical decision that reflects project-specific priorities:

**PVC sheet membrane advantages in tunnels:**
- Heat-weldable seams: PVC can be thermally welded in the field with standard hot-air equipment,
  producing seams that are strong and can be tested with a wire probe in a dual-channel seam
- Slightly stiffer material: the relative stiffness of PVC can make installation against a
  concave primary lining easier in some configurations (fewer folds)
- Lower material cost at equivalent thickness
- Established QA testing protocols: dual-weld probe testing is a standardised QA method for
  PVC seams that is well-understood by European tunnel contractors

**EPDM sheet membrane advantages in tunnels:**
- Superior elasticity: EPDM's 300-500% elongation (vs 200-300% for PVC) provides greater
  accommodation of differential settlement and thermal movement at the junction between the
  tunnel and connected structures
- Chemical resistance: EPDM's saturated backbone outperforms PVC (which contains plasticisers
  subject to extraction in aggressive groundwater) over 100+ year design lives
- Temperature performance: EPDM maintains flexibility at -45°C (important for above-ground
  portals in mountain terrain) vs PVC which stiffens significantly below -15°C
- No plasticiser migration: PVC tunnel membranes contain plasticisers that, over decades, can
  migrate out of the membrane and into the surrounding concrete, causing gradual stiffening and
  potential long-term loss of elongation. EPDM has no plasticiser to migrate.
- Lower thermal expansion coefficient: EPDM's dimensional stability reduces the risk of membrane
  buckling in zones where the membrane spans from a cold to a warm zone (portal areas)
- Seaming by adhesive and tape: EPDM tunnel seams using QuickSeam tape and primer systems
  can be tested by visual inspection under magnification; modern EPDM tape seams in tunnel
  applications achieve peel strengths exceeding the parent membrane tensile strength

**Bentonite waterproofing (bentonite geosynthetic liners, GCLs):**
Sodium bentonite GCLs (thin layers of bentonite clay sandwiched between geotextile layers)
are an alternative to sheet membranes for some cut-and-cover applications. Their advantages
include: self-healing at low-pressure defect zones; good hydration performance; competitive
cost. Their disadvantages for tunnel applications include: poor performance in aggressive or
desiccating groundwater conditions; inability to withstand high hydrostatic pressure without
careful confinement; susceptibility to chemical attack from ionic strength groundwater;
inability to form reliable seams in field conditions without specialist equipment.

For Portuguese conditions with diverse geology from granite (Minho) to limestone (Algarve),
EPDM's consistent performance across the groundwater chemistry range is a significant advantage
over bentonite, which performs poorly in aggressive or ionically modified groundwater.

**Cementitious crystalline waterproofing:**
Crystalline and cementitious waterproofing systems (Sika, Penetron, Xypex) work by forming
insoluble calcium silicate hydrates within the concrete pore structure. They are integral
(applied to the concrete surface) rather than sheet-based, and their performance is fundamentally
dependent on the quality and homogeneity of the host concrete. In practice:
- Effective for structures with minor porosity in high-quality concrete
- Poor performance in concrete with form-tie holes, honeycombing, or construction joint defects
- Cannot bridge structural cracks in the manner that elastomeric EPDM can
- Self-healing capability (crystalline re-growth when wetted) is an advantage at micro-crack level

For tunnel applications with complex geometry, construction joints, and the certainty that some
concrete quality variability will occur, EPDM sheet membrane provides more reliable and
predictable waterproofing performance than cementitious systems.

## Fire Safety in Tunnel Waterproofing

Fire safety is a critical design parameter for tunnel waterproofing, particularly for road and
rail tunnels accessible to the public and to emergency services. The relevant European standards
for fire performance of tunnel lining materials include:

**EN 13501-1 (Reaction to fire: classification):**
EPDM tunnel membranes are classified by reaction to fire under EN 13501-1. Typical classifications
for EPDM geomembranes: Euroclass E or D (without dripping), depending on formulation and test
configuration. For tunnel applications, halogen-free EPDM formulations are available that achieve
Euroclass Cfl (floor application) or Dfl when tested in the relevant geometry.

**Halogen-free EPDM for tunnels:**
Standard EPDM does not contain halogens (chlorine, fluorine, bromine) in its base polymer.
PVC, by contrast, contains approximately 57% chlorine by mass — when burned, PVC generates
hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas, which is highly toxic and corrosive in tunnel fire scenarios.
EPDM combustion products are primarily water vapour and carbon dioxide, with much lower toxicity
index than PVC combustion gases. For tunnel fire scenarios, EPDM is the clearly preferred
material from a life safety perspective.

**EPDM in the secondary lining zone:**
In bored tunnels with double lining, the EPDM membrane is encased between the primary shotcrete
lining and the secondary cast-in-place lining — it is not directly exposed to the tunnel interior.
In a fire event, the secondary concrete lining provides substantial thermal protection; the
membrane's fire behaviour is of less direct relevance than in exposed membrane applications.
However, the secondary lining concrete can spall in severe fires, potentially exposing the
membrane, which is why halogen-free EPDM formulations are specified for safety-critical tunnels.

## Seismic Design and EPDM Tunnel Waterproofing

Portugal is one of the most seismically active countries in Western Europe. The 1755 Lisbon
earthquake (magnitude ~8.5-9.0 Mw) and the ongoing seismic activity of the Azores-Gibraltar
fracture zone are key context for tunnel design. Eurocode 8 (EN 1998) applies to all tunnel
structures in Portugal, and seismic design must be considered for waterproofing details at
tunnel portals, at construction joints, and at interfaces with rigid structures (stations,
shafts, junction boxes).

The critical seismic concern for tunnel waterproofing is differential movement at construction
joints and at the transition between flexible tunnel lining and rigid connected structures.
These are the locations most likely to experience concentrated deformation during a seismic
event, and they are also the locations most likely to experience waterproofing failure.

EPDM's 300-500% elongation provides a substantial reserve of deformation capacity at these
critical joints. At a typical tunnel-to-station junction, the EPDM membrane is configured
with a specific expansion loop or bellows detail:
- A controlled excess of membrane length is formed into a fold or bellows at the joint
- Under seismic deformation, this excess material unfolds to accommodate the movement
- The EPDM material itself continues to contribute elongation beyond the bellows geometry
- The result is a waterproofing detail that can accommodate tens of millimetres of differential
  movement without loss of continuity

EPDM expansion joint details for Portuguese seismic conditions are designed in accordance with:
- EN 1998-1: Design of structures for earthquake resistance — general rules
- EN 1998-4: Silos, tanks and pipelines (the closest proxy standard for buried tunnel structures)
- NP EN 1998-1 (Portuguese National Annex): with the Portuguese national seismic hazard zones
  (Zone 1.1-1.6 in the south, Zone 2.1-2.6 in the north, per EN 1998 NA)

## Portuguese Tunnel Projects and EPDM Context

Portugal's infrastructure investment programme — including the Ferrovia 2020 rail programme,
the Programa Nacional de Investimentos (PNI 2030), and the ongoing high-speed rail development
(Alta Velocidade) — involves substantial tunnel construction that creates demand for high-
performance tunnel waterproofing.

Relevant Portuguese tunnel infrastructure categories:

**Metro systems:**
- Metro do Porto: multiple tunnel sections, including the Boavista and Yellow Line tunnels,
  with geomembrane waterproofing systems in cut-and-cover sections
- Metro de Lisboa: ongoing extension works (Odivelas line, Red Line Alcântara extension)
  involving cut-and-cover stations and connecting bored tunnel sections
- Metro Sul do Tejo (Almada-Seixal): light metro system with cut-and-cover sections at
  grade crossings

**Road tunnels:**
- A23 tunnels through the Serra da Gardunha and Beira Interior: mountain tunnels with
  fractured granite groundwater
- Túnel de Marão (IC24/A4): at 5.6 km, one of Portugal's longest road tunnels; opened 2017;
  represents the current state of tunnel waterproofing practice in Portugal
- Túnel do Cachão (EN 213, Trás-os-Montes): older tunnel now retrofitted with modern
  waterproofing systems
- Túnel da Arrábida (Porto ring road, A29): EPDM geomembrane waterproofing system installed
  during construction; represents urban tunnel practice in northern Portugal

**Rail tunnels:**
- Túneis da Variante de Alcácer (Fertagus line, Setúbal): multiple tunnels through limestone
  and clay formations with variable groundwater
- Planned high-speed rail tunnels (Porto-Lisboa Alta Velocidade, Campanhã-Soure section):
  significant tunnel requirements through varied Portuguese geology

**Historic infrastructure rehabilitation:**
A growing sector in Portugal is the waterproofing rehabilitation of existing tunnel structures
built in the 20th century with inadequate or degraded waterproofing. The Membriko EPDM system
is applicable to rehabilitation projects involving:
- Application of EPDM to exposed concrete tunnel lining after concrete repair
- Lining of drainage channels and sumps within tunnel drainage infrastructure
- Waterproofing of maintenance access tunnels and service galleries

## Geotextile Protection Layer

In all tunnel EPDM applications, the membrane is protected by a geotextile protection layer
that serves multiple functions:
- Prevents puncture of the EPDM membrane by irregularities in the primary lining (shot-rock
  edges, shotcrete surface roughness, aggregate protrusions)
- Provides a consistent drainage plane between primary and secondary lining
- Distributes point loads that would otherwise be concentrated on the membrane
- Protects the membrane during secondary lining concrete pour (concrete placement pressure,
  vibration, pump hose dragging)

Standard geotextile weights used with EPDM tunnel membranes:
- Minimum protection (smooth, prepared concrete substrate): 300-500 g/m² non-woven PP
- Standard protection (shotcrete primary lining): 500-700 g/m² non-woven PP
- Heavy protection (rough shot-rock face): 700-1,000 g/m² non-woven PP or composite layer

The geotextile is installed immediately before the EPDM membrane and is not bonded to it —
the combination of membrane weight and subsequent secondary lining concrete weight provides
adequate compression of the sandwich.
