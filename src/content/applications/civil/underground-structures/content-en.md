# Underground Structure Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## The Invisible Failure Problem — Why Underground Failures Are the Most Expensive

Underground waterproofing is, across the whole of civil engineering, the discipline where the
difference between correct specification and inadequate specification carries the most severe
and most expensive consequences. A failing roof covering manifests as ceiling leaks — disruptive
and costly, but accessible for repair. A failing basement waterproofing manifests differently:
water that silently corrodes structural reinforcement steel, deteriorates buried electrical and
telecommunications installations, and sustains mould growth in occupied spaces. When remediation
finally becomes unavoidable, the cost of excavating around an occupied building — or of lining
the interior of a flooded basement — is typically five to fifteen times the cost of correct
specification at the time of construction.

Membriko, based in Pombal and operating throughout Portugal, understands this reality from direct
experience. We work on urban residential basements, underground car parks, utility service
chambers and civil engineering structures where the margin for error is zero. The EPDM membrane
that Membriko specifies and installs is the engineering answer to the underground environment
because it is designed to perform without failure for fifty to one hundred years, in permanent
contact with groundwater, under sustained hydrostatic pressure, without any maintenance
requirement. It is not an interim solution requiring reinvestment within twenty years. It is a
single engineering decision, made correctly, once.

This document explains how and why — with the technical clarity that the engineers who specify
us require and the clients who commission us deserve.

## Why EPDM Is the Correct Material for Underground Structures

The underground environment places specific demands on any waterproofing system. For a membrane
to perform reliably for decades below ground, it must satisfy a set of requirements that few
individual materials can simultaneously deliver:

- Resistance to permanent immersion in groundwater of variable chemistry (pH ranging from 4.5
  to 9.0 depending on the local geology and any contamination present)
- Resistance to sustained hydrostatic pressure, including seasonal water table fluctuations
- Capacity to accommodate structural movement of the concrete — shrinkage, settlement,
  cracking, seismic deformation — without loss of watertight integrity
- Chemical resistance to the aggressive soil environment: sulphates, chlorides, organic acids,
  and in contaminated sites, hydrocarbons and industrial leachate
- Zero maintenance dependency: underground waterproofing cannot rely on periodic access for
  reworking, injection or reapplication

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) meets all of these requirements through its molecular
architecture. The primary polymer backbone of EPDM is fully saturated — exclusively single
carbon-to-carbon and carbon-to-hydrogen bonds — rendering it intrinsically inert to the chemical
agents present in the underground environment. This resistance is not provided by additives that
deplete with time: it is a permanent property of the polymer itself.

Membriko specifies EPDM for underground structures because it is the only material that combines
complete chemical resistance with an elongation at break exceeding 400%. This elongation is the
most differentiating property in the underground context: cracked concrete opens from millimetres
to tens of millimetres; Membriko's EPDM membrane accommodates that movement without tearing. No
cementitious system, no bentonite, no rigid coating achieves the same.

## Underground Structure Types — EPDM Membrane Applications

### Basements

Basements are the most common underground structure type in the Portuguese construction market,
particularly in the cities of Lisbon, Porto and the coastal urban centres where land scarcity
drives building underground for parking, storage and plant rooms. The specific challenge of
Portuguese urban basements is the variability of the water table: in the alluvial zones of
Lisbon — the Baixa, the Chiado, Cais do Sodré, the Almada riverfront — the water table can be
as shallow as one to three metres below street level, creating hydrostatic pressure on base slabs
and buried walls that many conventional waterproofing systems cannot sustain permanently.

Membriko installs basement waterproofing using 1.5 mm EPDM membrane in a fully adhered system
bonded to the structural concrete, ensuring that no water migration path exists between the
membrane and the substrate in the event of localised damage. The critical junction in all tanked
basements — the junction between the base slab and the perimeter wall — is resolved by Membriko
with pre-formed EPDM transition pieces and continuous membrane wrap, eliminating the jointed
detail that is the most common origin of long-term leakage in conventionally tanked structures.

Membriko works on new-build basements — in close coordination with the main contractor and
structural engineer — and on remediation projects for existing basements with inadequate or
failed waterproofing. For in-use basements with active water ingress where external access
requires demolition, Membriko offers interior tanking with EPDM mechanically fixed to the
internal face.

### Underground Car Parks

Underground car parks combine the hydrostatic challenges of basements with a specific chemical
aggression that distinguishes them from every other underground application: exposure to
chlorides from vehicles (de-icing salts on tyres and bodywork, marine aerosols in coastal cities),
to hydrocarbons (fuels and oils), and to alkaline cleaning detergents used in mechanical floor
washing. Dynamic traffic loading additionally transmits stresses through the slab to the
waterproofing system.

For this application, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM — the design thickness for critical
applications — fully adhered to the underside of the structural slab, with heavy-duty protection
board (HDPE minimum 8 mm, or extruded polystyrene XPS at 20 mm) installed above the membrane
to protect the elastomeric surface from the concentrated loading of tyres and maintenance
equipment.

Floor drainage sumps, slab penetrations for columns, service pipes and cable ducts are detailed
with pre-formed EPDM accessories — compression flange collars, penetration sleeves, sealing
rings — that create hermetic mechanical and chemical seals without reliance on mastics or silicone
as primary sealants. Membriko dimensions these details from the project's services drawings,
ensuring that no penetration point is under-specified.

Membriko has experience on underground car parks in Portuguese cities with elevated water
tables, having installed waterproofing systems for structures of one to four basement levels
with design hydrostatic pressures between 10 and 40 kPa.

### Metro Stations and Railway Tunnels

Metro stations and underground rail tunnels represent the highest-specification waterproofing
application in civil construction. Structures in active operation within the Lisbon and Porto
metro systems are at depths between five and thirty metres, subject to hydrostatic pressures
of 50 to 300 kPa, in permanent contact with groundwater over decades of operational life.
Tolerance to any leakage is, in practice, zero: water ingress compromises the electrical safety
of rail systems, corrodes structural reinforcement, and deteriorates station finishes and
equipment in ways that cannot be repaired without closing the line.

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for metro and rail tunnel applications, in pre-applied systems
(where the membrane is fixed to the temporary excavation support before the concrete is poured)
or post-applied systems (for sections where the external face is accessible during construction).
In pre-applied sections, the EPDM membrane is mechanically fixed to the earth-retaining
structure with the bonding face inward, and concrete is poured directly against the inner face
of the membrane — creating a direct mechanical bond between the concrete and the EPDM that
eliminates any longitudinal water migration path between the membrane and the structure in the
event of localised damage.

Membriko can support the project engineer with technical documentation for submission on
railway infrastructure projects, including test data sheets, declarations of conformity, and
quality control plans for employer's supervision.

### Utility Vaults and Service Chambers

Underground utility infrastructure — telecommunications vaults, electrical substations, valve
chambers, inspection chambers, cable routing chambers — are compact underground structures that
house sensitive equipment and that, when they leak, create immediate operational problems and
remediation costs disproportionate to the value of the structure itself.

Membriko waterproofs service chambers with EPDM panels fabricated to the specific geometry of
each vault, installed in confined spaces without flame equipment. Membriko's cold-applied seaming
system (QuickSeam) requires no torch or heat source, eliminating the safety risks and hot-work
permit requirements that arise with heat-welded membrane systems in confined spaces containing
gas infrastructure.

For electrical infrastructure, Membriko verifies the compatibility of the EPDM waterproofing
system with any cathodic protection systems installed on adjacent metallic utility infrastructure,
ensuring that the membrane does not create conducting paths that would interfere with cathodic
protection current distribution.

## Hydrostatic Pressure — The Physics of the Underground Environment

Hydrostatic pressure is the defining physical challenge of underground waterproofing. Each metre
of depth below the water table corresponds to approximately 10 kPa (0.1 bar) of pressure on
the membrane. For a basement at three metres depth in a site with the water table at one metre
below ground level, the hydrostatic pressure at the base slab is approximately 20 kPa. For a
metro station at fifteen metres depth, pressure can reach 150 kPa or above.

This distinction is critical for specification: a waterproofing system that is not rated for
hydrostatic conditions — designed only for rain or condensation, not for immersion under pressure
— fails by deformation and delamination when the water table rises to the structure. Membriko
specifies exclusively hydrostatic waterproofing systems for all structures that may, in any
circumstances, fall below the permanent or seasonal water table.

The EN 1928 Method A test (full immersion under hydrostatic pressure for 24 hours; no water
penetration constitutes a pass) is the test that validates the membrane for its design hydrostatic
head. Membriko's EPDM membrane passes this test at 200 kPa — the equivalent of twenty metres
of water column. For a standard basement at three to four metres depth, this represents a safety
factor of five to ten times the design hydrostatic pressure.

A frequently underestimated phenomenon is **hydrostatic uplift pressure** on the base slab:
when the water table rises above the slab soffit level, the groundwater exerts upward pressure
on the slab and on the waterproofing membrane. If the membrane is not fully bonded to the slab,
this uplift pressure can delaminate the membrane from the concrete surface, creating pockets
where water accumulates and pressure progressively increases. Membriko's fully adhered system
eliminates this failure mechanism by design.

---

## Installation Systems — Pre-Applied, Post-Applied and Sandwich

### Pre-Applied (Blind-Side) Waterproofing

Pre-applied waterproofing is installed on the excavation support or temporary formwork before
the structural concrete is placed. The EPDM membrane is mechanically fixed to the support with
the bonding face inward. When the concrete is poured, the slab or wall bonds directly to the
inner face of the membrane.

Membriko uses the pre-applied system when:
- The external face of the structure is not accessible after construction (bored pile walls,
  secant piles, permanent Berlin walls)
- Construction is top-down (the slab is built before the lower perimeter walls)
- The client wishes to maximise waterproofing continuity without dependence on concrete
  surface quality after striking formwork

Membriko's pre-applied EPDM incorporates a geotextile fleece backing on the concrete-contact
face to improve mechanical bonding with green concrete. Sheet-to-sheet laps are executed with
a minimum 150 mm overlap and QuickSeam tape, ensuring continuity of the hydrostatic barrier
across the entire perimeter.

### Post-Applied (Fully Adhered) Waterproofing

Post-applied waterproofing is installed on the external face of the completed structural
concrete, before backfilling. It is the most common system for basements and structures where
the external face is accessible during construction.

Membriko installs the EPDM membrane in a fully adhered system — complete bonding to the concrete
surface using immersion-rated contact adhesive. Full adhesion is essential for underground
structures: any un-bonded area becomes a water migration path under hydrostatic pressure, which
can propagate a small breach into an extended path that emerges far from the entry point —
making leak location and repair significantly more difficult.

Concrete surface preparation before application is executed by Membriko with the same rigour
as the membrane installation itself: cleaning by compressed air jet, repair of honeycombing and
segregation, grinding of sharp edges, verification of surface moisture content (maximum 8%
before adhesive application), and primer application where required.

### Sandwich / Protected Membrane System

In some underground structures — accessible service vaults requiring pressure relief, inverted
base slabs with drainage alleviation, maintenance-accessible underground structures — Membriko
installs the EPDM in a sandwich configuration:

**structural slab → drainage geocomposite → EPDM membrane → protection board → backfill or screed**

The drainage geocomposite relieves hydrostatic pressure by directing groundwater to perimeter
collection drains or controlled outlet points, reducing the working pressure on the membrane
and allowing more economical membrane thicknesses to be specified for moderate design pressures.

---

## Tanking System Design — The Continuous Waterproof Envelope

The tanking concept — creating a continuous waterproof envelope around the entire underground
structure, without joints or weak points — is the waterproofing philosophy Membriko applies to
every underground project. The structure sits, conceptually, inside an EPDM "tank": groundwater
finds no entry point because there are no discontinuities in the envelope.

This philosophy has direct practical implications for how Membriko details the critical junctions.

### Wall-to-Slab Junction

The junction between the base slab and the perimeter wall is, in all conventional tanking systems,
the highest-risk point for water ingress. It is here that two structural elements with different
shrinkage and deformation behaviours meet, and it is here that concrete construction joints are
unavoidable.

Membriko resolves this junction with a total continuity approach: the base slab EPDM membrane
is turned up vertically and extended over the perimeter wall face by a minimum of 300 mm, without
any joint across the angle of transition. Pre-formed EPDM fillet pieces are bonded into the
internal angle to prevent tensile stress concentrations in the membrane at the corner. Continuity
between slab and wall is guaranteed by a single panel without transverse joints at the highest-
risk detail in the tanking system.

### Service Penetrations — Pipes, Cables and Ducts

All service penetrations through the EPDM membrane are executed with pre-formed accessories:

- **Circular pipes:** EPDM rubber sleeve with stainless steel compression flanges; the sleeve
  is bonded to the pipe collar and to the membrane with QuickSeam; the flanges are torqued
  with stainless steel fasteners to create a hermetic mechanical seal
- **Rectangular penetrations and cable boxes:** EPDM termination channel fabricated to size
  in Membriko's workshop; perimeter bonding to the main membrane with 150 mm QuickSeam tape
- **Anchor bolts and fixing rods:** pre-formed penetration sleeves accommodating the geometry
  of the rod or fixing

Membriko does not use mastics, silicones or polyurethane sealants as primary seals at any
singular point. These materials have limited service lives — five to fifteen years — incompatible
with the 50+ year service life of the EPDM membrane.

### Concrete Construction Joints

Concrete construction joints — where concreting was interrupted and resumed — are planes of
weakness where cracking and ingress are most likely to occur. Membriko installs EPDM waterstop
strips bonded over all visible construction joints before installing the main membrane, creating
a dedicated secondary barrier at the plane of highest risk.

---

## Gas Protection — Radon and Methane

Underground structure waterproofing extends beyond water. Two soil gases present specific hazards
that Membriko's EPDM membrane system addresses as an integrated capability.

### Radon — Portugal's Geological Risk

Radon (Rn-222) is a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium-238 in
granitic rocks and certain uranium-bearing geological formations. It is colourless, odourless,
chemically inert, and radiologically hazardous: prolonged indoor radon exposure is the second
leading cause of lung cancer in Europe after smoking (IARC/WHO classification).

Portugal has significant areas of elevated geological radon concentration, particularly:
- **Beira Interior and Serra da Estrela:** uranium-bearing granites with significant radon
  emissions; the highest-risk area in mainland Portugal
- **Trás-os-Montes:** granites and uranium-bearing formations; moderate to high risk
- **Alentejo:** specific geological formations with localised uraniferous zones
- **Greater Lisbon area:** specific geological contexts in certain locations

Membriko's EPDM membrane acts as an effective radon gas retarding barrier. The radon diffusion
coefficient through 1.5 mm EPDM is of the order of 2 × 10⁻¹² m²/s — corresponding to a
radon equivalent thickness of 200 to 400 mm of concrete for radiological attenuation purposes.
EPDM is recognised in Portuguese technical guidance (Direcção-Geral da Saúde) and European
guidance (BRE 211, EN 13829) as a suitable radon-retarding membrane for new construction and
refurbishment.

In high-risk zones, Membriko specifies the EPDM membrane in combination with a passive sub-slab
depressurisation system: a drainage geocomposite layer beneath the slab, with ventilation risers
connected to atmosphere or to the building's mechanical ventilation. This system maintains a
relative negative pressure beneath the slab, preventing radon entry even if the membrane is
locally damaged. For very high-risk locations, or where post-construction radon testing returns
results above 300 Bq/m³ (the action level per Portaria 353-A/2013), active extraction can be
specified over the geocomposite.

### Methane and Landfill Gas

Sites with organic contamination, historic landfill, former gasworks, or petrol filling stations
being redeveloped for residential or commercial use may produce methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide
(CO₂) from anaerobic decomposition of organic material. Methane is flammable between 5% and 15%
by volume (lower and upper explosive limits) and CO₂ is asphyxiant. Membriko addresses sites
with identified landfill gas risk using an integrated strategy:

1. **EPDM membrane as primary gas retarding barrier:** EPDM's low permeability to methane is
   sufficient to constitute an effective primary barrier in moderate gas risk situations
2. **Venting drainage geocomposite:** installed beneath the membrane, connected to passive
   venting risers that allow gases to migrate to atmosphere rather than accumulating beneath
   the slab
3. **Gas-tight service entry accessories:** all singular points (pipes, cables, ducts) are
   sealed with EPDM accessories with gas barrier geometry, not merely water barrier geometry
4. **Active extraction:** for sites where measured methane concentrations exceed design
   thresholds, passive venting is supplemented with active mechanical extraction

Membriko performs a chemical compatibility assessment of the waterproofing system against the
soil gases identified at each contaminated site, based on the ground investigation and
contamination characterisation reports provided by the client or specialist environmental
consultants.

## EPDM vs Alternative Underground Waterproofing Systems

Membriko presents this comparison with technical objectivity. Every system has legitimate
applications; our aim is to give the specifier the correct information to make the right decision
for each specific project.

| Characteristic | EPDM (Membriko) | Sodium Bentonite (GCL) | PVC Membrane | Cementitious / Crystalline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hydrostatic resistance | Excellent — EN 1928 >200 kPa | Good — requires full confinement | Good — EN 1928 | Limited — cracks with structural movement |
| Elongation / crack bridging | 400%+ — accommodates 50 mm+ movement | Low — sheet tears at cracks | 200-300% | Near zero — brittle failure |
| Hydrocarbon chemical resistance | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Good |
| Calcium ion exchange risk | None | High — degrades in hard groundwater | None | None |
| Desiccation risk | None | High — self-healing fails when dry | None | Partial |
| Gas retardation (radon/methane) | Excellent | Limited | Good | Poor |
| Cold application (no flame) | Yes | Yes | No (hot-weld seams) | Yes |
| Seismic deformation accommodation | Excellent | Limited | Good | None |
| Expected service life | 50+ years | 30-50 years (site-dependent) | 30-40 years | 20-30 years |

**Note on bentonite:** geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) is a cost-effective and proven system in
stable, fully confined applications with non-aggressive groundwater and without significant water
table fluctuations. Membriko acknowledges that under these conditions, bentonite can be a valid
alternative. The limitation arises when the ground is calcareous (calcium ion exchange), when
the site dries seasonally (desiccation), or when chemical contamination is present (hydrocarbons,
concentrated sulphates) — conditions that are common across central and southern Portugal.

**Note on cementitious systems:** crystalline admixtures provide genuine secondary protection
when incorporated into the structural concrete mix. As a primary waterproofing system for
structures subject to structural movement and significant hydrostatic pressure, their rigidity
is a fundamental limitation — particularly in seismic zones, which describes the majority of
southern Portugal.

## Maintenance of Underground Waterproofing Systems

One of the fundamental advantages of EPDM membrane in the underground context is the near-
total absence of membrane-specific maintenance requirements. EPDM does not require re-treatment,
injection, reactivation or any form of periodic maintenance throughout its service life.

### Drainage System Maintenance

Where the waterproofing system includes a drainage geocomposite layer and collection drains,
Membriko recommends:

- **Annual inspection of drainage outlets:** verify that perimeter drains are not blocked by
  sediment or root intrusion; flush with a water jet if required
- **Inspection of ventilation risers (where applicable for radon or methane):** confirm that
  outlet points are unobstructed and that passive ventilation is functioning
- **Recording of any change in water inflow rate:** if the rate of water entering the drainage
  system increases significantly from one year to the next, investigate the cause before
  assuming it is solely seasonal water table variation

### Visual Inspection of Accessible Membrane Areas

In structures with accessible membrane zones (service chambers, maintenance-access vaults,
accessible basement soffit sections), Membriko recommends annual visual inspection:

- Check the integrity of visible laps: no lifting or separation of the QuickSeam joint
- Check service penetration points: no evidence of moisture at the boundary of the sealing
  sleeve
- Check the perimeter termination bar (where applicable): fixings retained, no evidence of
  corrosion of fasteners or anchor plates

### Repair in Case of Damage

Should mechanical damage to the EPDM membrane be identified during refurbishment works on an
existing installation, Membriko executes repairs using an EPDM patch of matching thickness
and formulation, bonded with QuickPrime primer and 150 mm QuickSeam tape over the damaged zone,
with a minimum 75 mm overlap in all directions over the clean, dry surrounding membrane.

For damage to membrane areas beneath concrete or backfill — detected by the appearance of
water ingress at an interior surface — Membriko performs diagnostic assessment using electronic
leak detection (Electric Leak Detection) before defining the remediation strategy, to avoid
unnecessary excavation.

## Portuguese Underground Construction Context

The Portuguese underground construction market is expanding rapidly, driven by converging
pressures: urban densification in Lisbon and Porto that exhausts surface land and drives
construction underground for parking, utilities and plant rooms; large-scale urban brownfield
regeneration in central city locations (former industrial areas of Alcântara, Marvila and
Campanhã in Lisbon; Campanhã and Matosinhos in Porto); and the expansion programmes for the
metro networks in both major cities, with works in progress and planned that involve deep
excavation in variable urban geology.

Portuguese geology presents specific characteristics that Membriko understands and incorporates
into waterproofing system specification:

**Lisbon and the Tagus valley:** Holocene alluvial deposits with high and variable water tables;
saturated clays and sands with susceptibility to seismic liquefaction; low-resistance soils
requiring temporary excavation support (bored piles, Berlin walls). In this geological context,
pre-applied waterproofing is frequently the only technically viable option for wall faces.

**Porto and the Douro valley:** weathered granite with moderate water tables but fractured rock
that can conduct water in a concentrated fashion; the waterproofing system must accommodate
sudden increases in flow rate at fracture planes without localised pressure compromising
membrane integrity.

**Northern Portugal and Beira Interior:** compact granites with low water tables under normal
conditions, but with significant radon risk that makes gas-retarding membrane specification
mandatory, not optional.

**Algarve and the southern coast:** carbonate sediments with karstic dissolution features
(voids, sinkholes), water tables influenced by proximity to the ocean, and risk of saline
intrusion in coastal zones. EPDM's resistance to seawater and chlorides is a critical
requirement in these conditions.

---

## Regulations — EN 13967 and Portuguese Technical Standards

Membriko's EPDM membrane for underground waterproofing is manufactured and certified in
accordance with the applicable European standards, and the installation system complies with
the regulatory framework governing underground works in Portugal and the EU.

### EN 13967 — Product Standard for Underground Waterproofing Membranes

EN 13967 (Flexible sheets for waterproofing — Plastic and rubber sheets for damp-proofing
including underground applications) is the European product standard that specifies performance
requirements and test methods for flexible membranes in underground applications. It defines
three water exposure classes:

- **Class W1:** no hydrostatic pressure (above the permanent water table, soil moisture
  only)
- **Class W2:** low hydrostatic pressure (up to 3 m water column)
- **Class W3:** high hydrostatic pressure (above 3 m water column)

Membriko specifies Class W3 membranes for all structures that may, even seasonally, fall below
the water table. CE marking under EN 13967 is mandatory for all underground waterproofing
products placed on the EU market.

### EN 1928 — Hydrostatic Watertightness

The EN 1928 test (Method A — full immersion under pressure; Method B — vacuum test) validates
the membrane's resistance to the design hydrostatic head. Membriko requires Method A compliance
for all applications where the design hydrostatic pressure exceeds 20 kPa.

### NP EN 1992 (Eurocode 2) and NP EN 1997 (Eurocode 7)

These Portuguese national standards govern the design of structural concrete and the geotechnical
design respectively. Compatibility between the waterproofing system and the structural and
geotechnical design is verified by Membriko in coordination with the project engineer on each
project.

### NP EN 1998 (Eurocode 8) — Seismic Design

Eurocode 8, adopted in Portugal, specifies inter-storey drift and relative deformation values
for which structural elements in Portuguese seismic zones must be designed. Membriko can provide
documentary confirmation that the 400%+ elongation of the EPDM membrane accommodates the
deformation values calculated by the structural engineer for each project, for inclusion in the
project design statement and building permit submission.

### Portaria 353-A/2013 — Indoor Air Quality and Radon

Portaria 353-A/2013 establishes reference limits for radon in workplaces and residential
buildings (300 Bq/m³ as the action level). Membriko's EPDM membrane is recognised by the
Direcção-Geral da Saúde as a radon-retarding membrane within compliant mitigation systems for
new construction in radon-risk zones.

## Seismic Considerations for Underground Structures in Portugal

Portugal has one of the highest seismic risk profiles in Western Europe. The Lisbon earthquake
of 1755 — with an estimated magnitude between 8.5 and 9.0 — destroyed the city and generated
a tsunami that affected the entire European and African Atlantic coastline. The seismic hazard
maps produced by IPMA and LNEC classify the majority of mainland Portugal south of the Tagus
and the whole of the Algarve within the highest seismic hazard zones in continental Europe.

For underground waterproofing, seismic loading creates a specific set of structural actions
that the waterproofing system must be capable of accommodating:

**Inter-storey drift:** the floors of a structure move relative to one another during a seismic
event. For underground structures, this translates to relative movement between the base slab
and the perimeter walls — precisely the junction that Membriko waterproofs with the greatest
attention to detail. The drift values for frequent earthquakes (95-year return period) calculated
under Eurocode 8 for Lisbon are of the order of 5 to 20 mm.

**Differential foundation settlement:** in soils with liquefaction potential (saturated sands
and silts, alluvial zones in central Lisbon, Almada, Setúbal), a seismic event can cause
differential settlements of 50 to 100 mm in extreme cases.

**Crack propagation in reinforced concrete:** crack widths permitted by the Eurocodes for
concrete under seismic actions are significantly larger than the serviceability widths —
seismic crack openings can reach 0.3 to 1.0 mm in conventionally reinforced concrete elements.

Membriko's EPDM membrane, with 400% elongation at break, accommodates movements of 50 mm and
crack openings of several millimetres without tearing — with a safety margin far exceeding any
rigid or semi-rigid waterproofing system. This is not an academic point in the Portuguese context:
it is a project requirement for any underground structure in the seismic zones of Lisbon, the
Algarve and the Alentejo.

Membriko collaborates with structural engineers in providing documented verification of the
compatibility between EPDM membrane deformation capacity and the drift and crack width values
calculated in the structural design, for support to permit submissions and quality control
supervision.

## Frequently Asked Questions on Underground Structure Waterproofing

**What happens if the EPDM membrane is punctured during construction?**

EPDM underground membranes can be repaired during construction, before the protection board is
placed. Any visible damage is identified by systematic walk-over inspection of the complete
membrane surface and repaired with a bonded EPDM patch using QuickPrime primer and 150 mm
QuickSeam tape, with a minimum 75 mm overlap over clean, dry surrounding membrane in all
directions. Membriko carries out this final inspection before authorising installation of the
protection board and backfilling, ensuring the system handed over is intact.

**Is EPDM membrane suitable for basements subject to high hydrostatic pressure?**

Yes. The underground-grade EPDM that Membriko specifies is tested to EN 1928 Method A at 200
kPa — the equivalent of twenty metres of water column. For a standard basement at three to five
metres depth with the water table at one to two metres below ground level, the design hydrostatic
pressure is in the range of 10 to 40 kPa, corresponding to a safety factor of five to twenty
times the tested membrane capacity.

**What is the difference between pre-applied and post-applied waterproofing for underground
structures?**

Pre-applied (blind-side) waterproofing is installed on the excavation support before the
concrete is poured. The concrete bonds directly to the inner face of the membrane, eliminating
the water migration path between membrane and structure. It is used when the external face is
not accessible after construction (bored pile walls, top-down construction). Post-applied
waterproofing is installed on the completed structural concrete face, with full adhesion to the
external surface. Membriko designs and executes both systems and recommends the most appropriate
for each specific construction sequence.

**Does EPDM protect against radon gas in Portugal's high-risk zones?**

Yes. EPDM is recognised in DGS and BRE technical guidance as an effective radon-retarding
membrane. For sites in Portugal's highest geological risk zones — Beira Interior, Trás-os-Montes,
Serra da Estrela — Membriko specifies the EPDM system combined with passive sub-slab
depressurisation (drainage geocomposite and ventilation risers) for full radon mitigation
compliance with Portaria 353-A/2013 and DGS guidance.

**Does EPDM resist the aggressive chemicals present in contaminated soils?**

EPDM has excellent resistance to sulphates (exposure classes EA1 to EA4 per EN 206), chlorides,
organic acids and petroleum hydrocarbons. For sites with identified chemical contamination —
historic landfill, petrol stations, industrial zones — Membriko performs a chemical compatibility
assessment based on the ground investigation and contamination characterisation report, verifying
that the specific EPDM formulation specified is appropriate for the contaminant profile identified.

**What warranty does Membriko issue for underground structure waterproofing?**

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty for all underground waterproofing work. This
warranty is supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product warranty and to the ten-year
statutory defects period applicable to civil engineering structures in Portugal (Código Civil,
Art. 1225, and Decreto-Lei 273/2003). The warranty certificate, quality inspection report and
photographic as-built record are delivered to the client at project practical completion.

**How are pipe and cable penetrations through the membrane waterproofed?**

All service penetrations through the EPDM membrane are executed with pre-formed accessories:
EPDM rubber sleeves with stainless steel compression flanges for circular pipes; purpose-made
channels and flanges for rectangular penetrations and cable boxes. No mastic or silicone is
used as the primary seal — Membriko uses only EPDM-certified accessories rated for permanent
immersion, with service lives compatible with the main membrane.

**Can EPDM be installed in an existing basement that is actively leaking?**

Yes, in the majority of cases, but it requires accurate diagnosis and appropriate preparation.
Active water ingress must first be stopped with hydraulic quick-setting repair mortar. For
existing basements where external face access requires demolition, Membriko can execute interior
tanking — waterproofing the internal face of walls and slab with EPDM mechanically fixed to
the masonry or concrete. Membriko always carries out a full diagnostic survey before proposing
any remediation solution, ensuring the client receives a system sized to the actual ground
conditions rather than a generic proposal.
