# Underground Structures — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Underground waterproofing is a high-specification, high-consequence market dominated by
architects, structural engineers, civil contractors and building owners who have experienced
or fear catastrophic water ingress. The page must simultaneously speak to:

1. **Civil and structural engineers** who specify waterproofing systems on technical merit,
   need standards references, and evaluate systems on long-term performance data
2. **Developers and building owners** who are managing risk on capital projects and need to
   understand the consequences of under-specifying the waterproofing
3. **Contractors** who need to understand installation methods, system compatibility and
   practical workability in confined underground environments

The persuasion architecture must establish technical authority first, then address the specific
structure types that readers will recognise from their own projects (basements, car parks,
metro/rail works, utility vaults), then give the comparative data against the systems they
have been offered or used before. The gas protection section (radon and methane) addresses
a regulatory and health concern that is increasingly prominent in Portuguese construction.
The seismic section is a strong differentiator: no rigid waterproofing system can make the
deformation argument that EPDM makes, and seismic risk is a real and recognised hazard in
Portugal that specifiers take seriously.

The FAQ section targets the practical and commercial questions that underground waterproofing
clients ask — mostly about failure consequences, warranty scope, and installation logistics
in confined excavations.

The page is longer and more technically dense than the roofing or pool pages because the
audience is more technical and the decision is typically a larger capital commitment.

## Section 1: Introduction — The Invisible Failure Problem

**Purpose:** Establish the stakes of underground waterproofing failure and frame EPDM as
the engineering answer to a specific set of well-defined risks.

**Content:**
- Underground waterproofing failure is invisible until it causes structural or interior
  damage: corroding reinforcement, flooding of electrical infrastructure, damage to finishes,
  mould in occupied spaces
- The cost of remediation — excavating an occupied building to repair a leaking basement —
  is typically 5 to 15 times the cost of correct specification at construction
- The Membriko answer: EPDM waterproofing designed to match the planned service life of the
  structure — 50 to 100 years — with zero ongoing maintenance requirement
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / ≥ 400% elongation to absorb structural movement /
  Continuous hydrostatic resistance to 200 kPa / 20-year Membriko installation warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Proposta Técnica"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Underground Structures

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the chemistry and physics argument for why EPDM is the
correct material for the underground environment specifically.

**Content:**
- The underground environment: permanent groundwater contact, variable chemistry groundwater,
  hydrostatic pressure, structural movement, and the critical requirement for longevity without
  access for maintenance
- EPDM's saturated polymer backbone: intrinsic resistance to the groundwater chemistry
  challenges (sulphates, chlorides, organic acids, hydrocarbons)
- Elongation argument: 400%+ versus concrete's 0%; the membrane accommodates all the
  structural movement the concrete generates — cracks, settlement, seismic deformation,
  thermal cycles
- No maintenance required underground: EPDM is not a system that needs periodic
  re-treatment, recoating or injection; it is set-and-forget for the structure's life
- Physical data table:

| Property | Underground-Grade EPDM | Test Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness | 1.5 mm (standard) / 2.0 mm (critical) | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 20 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |
| Hydrostatic watertightness | Pass at 200 kPa | EN 1928 (Method A) |
| Chemical resistance (pH) | 4 to 12 — stable | — |
| Hydrocarbon resistance | Petroleum, mineral oils | ASTM D471 |
| Gas retardation (radon) | BRE 211 compliant | — |
| Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Section 3: Structure Types

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko has experience with the full range of underground
structure types and understands the specific requirements of each.

**Sub-sections:** Four structure type cards.

### 3a: Basements (Caves e Pisos Subterrâneos)
- Context: urban and suburban construction in Portugal; Lisbon alluvial zones; Porto Baixa;
  coastal residential development; the increasing trend of multi-storey underground car
  parks below residential towers
- Key challenge: water table depth variable seasonally; construction joint at wall/slab
  junction is the most common primary failure point
- EPDM solution: fully adhered tanking system; continuous wrap at wall/slab junction;
  pre-formed corner pieces; cold-applied seaming — no flame in occupied or neighbouring
  properties

### 3b: Underground Car Parks (Parques de Estacionamento Subterrâneos)
- Context: urban densification in Portugal driving underground car park construction below
  commercial and residential developments; aggressive chloride and hydrocarbon exposure
  from vehicles; dynamic loading from traffic
- Key challenges: chemical resistance to de-icing salts, petroleum products and alkaline
  cleaning agents; protection board selection to resist point loading from tyres; drain
  and column penetration details under traffic slab
- EPDM solution: 2.0 mm EPDM with heavy-duty HDPE or XPS protection board; chemically
  resistant to hydrocarbons, chlorides and all car park cleaning chemicals

### 3c: Metro Stations and Rail Tunnels
- Context: Lisbon and Porto metro system expansions; light rail; underground railway
  infrastructure; utility tunnels at depth
- Key challenges: highest hydrostatic pressures (up to 300 kPa); permanent full immersion;
  essentially zero remediation tolerance; electrical safety requirements; fire performance
  requirements in occupied stations
- EPDM solution: 2.0 mm pre-applied system on tunnel lining; factory-welded panels to
  minimise site seams; full hydraulic testing of completed sections; fire-retardant EPDM
  grades available for station platform areas

### 3d: Utility Vaults and Maintenance Chambers
- Context: telecommunications infrastructure, electrical substations, valve chambers,
  inspection wells, cable routing chambers
- Key challenges: confined installation space; equipment sensitivity to water ingress;
  40-60 year asset life cycle; compatibility with cathodic protection systems
- EPDM solution: cold-applied, no flame equipment in confined space; custom-fabricated
  panels for vault geometries; full continuity from floor to walls to lid

## Section 4: Hydrostatic Pressure — The Physics

**Purpose:** Explain the hydrostatic challenge in terms that both engineers and non-engineers
can follow, and demonstrate why EPDM's test performance is the correct specification for
the pressures encountered in Portuguese underground construction.

**Content:**
- Every metre of water depth = 10 kPa of hydrostatic pressure
- Seasonal water table variation: a basement that is above the water table in summer may
  be fully submerged in winter — the waterproofing must be designed for the worst case
- Upward hydrostatic pressure (uplift) on base slabs: requires the membrane system to
  resist delamination from uplift forces as well as penetration
- EN 1928 Method A testing explained: the membrane is fully immersed under defined
  pressure for 24 hours; no water penetration constitutes a pass
- Why rigid systems fail under hydrostatic pressure: cementitious coatings crack; bentonite
  requires full confinement; EPDM's elastomeric nature means it flexes under pressure without
  deforming permanently

---

## Section 5: Installation Systems — Pre-Applied, Post-Applied and Sandwich

**Purpose:** Give engineers and specifiers the technical information needed to select the
correct installation method for their site conditions.

**Content:** Three installation method descriptions.

### Pre-Applied (Blind-Side) Waterproofing
- When used: piled wall construction where external face is inaccessible after piling;
  top-down construction; contiguous bored pile (CBP) or secant pile walls
- Method: EPDM fixed to earthwork support before concrete pour; fleece backing bonds
  to green concrete; water path between membrane and structure is eliminated
- Key detail: lap continuity at sheet-to-sheet joints; corner and base junction treatment

### Post-Applied (Fully Adhered) Waterproofing
- When used: conventional cut-and-fill excavation with accessible external face; retaining
  wall structures; base slab applications
- Method: EPDM bonded to prepared structural concrete with immersion-rated adhesive; fully
  adhered (no air gap) to prevent water migration under membrane in event of localised breach
- Key detail: surface preparation requirements for concrete substrate; moisture content
  limits for adhesive application; protection board installation sequence

### Sandwich / Protected Membrane System
- When used: accessible vaults with drainage relief required; inverted basement slabs with
  drainage layer; maintenance-accessible underground structures
- Method: drainage geocomposite + EPDM membrane + protection board + structural screed or
  concrete; pressure relief via drainage layer reduces hydrostatic head on membrane
- Key detail: drain outlet detailing; geocomposite-to-EPDM transition; upstand continuity

---

## Section 6: Tanking System Design

**Purpose:** Explain the tanking concept — the continuous waterproof envelope — and why
EPDM is the optimal tanking material for underground structures.

**Content:**
- The tanking concept: the structure inside a continuous waterproof envelope; no weak joints
- Critical details in a tanking system: wall-to-slab junction (the most common failure
  point in all tanked basements); service penetrations; construction joint treatment
- How Membriko executes the wall/slab junction: EPDM wrapped continuously from base slab
  up the external face of the wall, with pre-formed fillets at the angle change
- Service penetrations: pre-formed EPDM pipe boots for circular penetrations; flanged
  collars mechanically sealed with EPDM compression rings; no mastic as primary seal
- Construction joints: EPDM waterstop strips bonded across all concrete construction joints
  to bridge the joint under full hydrostatic pressure

---

## Section 7: Gas Protection — Radon and Methane

**Purpose:** Address the gas protection dimension — a requirement that adds value to EPDM
over competing waterproofing systems and is regulated in Portugal.

**Content:**
- Radon: Portugal's geological radon risk map; affected regions (Beira Interior, Trás-os-Montes,
  Serra da Estrela); EPDM as a radon-retarding membrane per BRE 211; regulatory context
  (Portaria 353-A/2013; DGS guidance; EN 13829 for testing); combination of EPDM membrane
  with passive sub-floor depressurisation systems
- Methane and landfill gas: former landfill sites, gas works, petrol station redevelopments;
  EPDM gas retardation combined with venting geocomposite; passive and active venting; gas-tight
  service entry details
- Gas-retarding EPDM vs gas-barrier EPDM: for extreme methane hazard sites, specialist
  gas-barrier grades with aluminium foil laminate are available; Membriko can specify the
  appropriate grade for the site gas risk assessment

## Section 8: EPDM vs Bentonite / PVC / Cementitious Systems

**Purpose:** Proactively address the comparative options that specifiers will encounter.
Framed as technical analysis, not competitive attack.

**Content:** Comparison table with 8 rows.

| Characteristic | EPDM (Membriko) | Sodium Bentonite (GCL) | PVC Membrane | Cementitious Slurry / Crystalline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hydrostatic resistance | Excellent — EN 1928 >200 kPa | Good — requires full confinement | Good — EN 1928 | Limited — cracks at structural movement |
| Elongation / crack bridging | 400%+ — accommodates 50mm+ movement | Low — sheet tears at cracks | 200-300% | Near zero — brittle failure |
| Chemical resistance (hydrocarbons) | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Good |
| Calcium ion exchange risk | None | High — degrades in hard groundwater | None | None |
| Desiccation risk | None | High — self-healing fails when dry | None | Partial |
| Gas retardation (radon/methane) | Excellent | Limited | Good | Poor |
| Cold application (no flame) | Yes | Yes | No (hot-weld seams) | Yes |
| Seismic deformation accommodation | Excellent | Limited | Good | None |
| Service life | 50+ years | 30-50 years (site-dependent) | 30-40 years | 20-30 years |

Honest acknowledgement: bentonite GCL is a cost-effective and proven system in stable,
well-confined applications with non-aggressive groundwater; cementitious crystalline systems
provide genuine secondary protection to concrete and are valuable as admixtures; PVC
membranes have a long track record in tunnel waterproofing. Membriko's recommendation is
EPDM for structures with significant crack/movement risk, aggressive groundwater chemistry,
gas retardation requirements, or seismic exposure — which describes the majority of
Portuguese underground structures.

## Section 10: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Confirm the zero-maintenance proposition for underground applications and give
practical guidance on inspection regimes.

**Content:**
- No membrane-specific maintenance required: EPDM in underground applications is a passive
  system requiring no re-treatment, injection or recoating for its service life
- Drainage system maintenance: any relief drainage geocomposite or collection drain system
  should be inspected and flushed periodically; this is a drainage maintenance requirement,
  not a membrane maintenance requirement
- Inspection protocol: annual visual inspection of any exposed membrane at wall base, at
  drainage outlet points, and at all penetration details; look for any sign of membrane
  lifting, deterioration at penetrations, or blockage of drainage outlets
- Repair if required: localised damage is repairable by cutting out the affected section
  and bonding in a new EPDM patch; Membriko provides repair materials and a repair protocol
  to clients at project handover
- Membriko post-completion inspection: 12-month inspection offered after practical
  completion to verify system performance through the first full seasonal groundwater cycle

## Section 11: Portuguese Underground Construction Context

**Purpose:** Contextualise the application within the Portuguese construction market —
showing awareness of the specific geological, regulatory and market conditions.

**Content:**
- Portuguese urban geology: alluvial water tables in Lisbon and Porto; granite groundwater
  in northern Portugal; karst in Algarve and Alentejo limestone zones; contaminated urban
  brownfield sites in former industrial zones (Barreiro, Setúbal, Matosinhos)
- Urban densification: the pressure on Lisbon and Porto to build underground (parking,
  services, residential storage) driven by land scarcity and planning density requirements
- Historic construction stock: many Portuguese basements were built without waterproofing
  or with inadequate damp-proofing systems; renovation and remediation of existing failing
  basement waterproofing is a significant part of the market
- Procurement routes: most underground waterproofing work in Portugal is specified by a
  structural or civil engineer and carried out by a specialist subcontractor; Membriko
  works on both direct-client and subcontract bases, and can support the specifier with
  technical documentation for project submission

---

## Section 12: Regulations — EN 13967 and Portuguese Technical Standards

**Purpose:** Provide regulatory and standards context for specifiers and building control.

**Content:**
- EN 13967: Flexible sheets for waterproofing — Plastic and rubber sheets for damp-proofing
  including underground applications; the fundamental product standard for EPDM underground
  membranes; performance classes W1 (no hydrostatic pressure), W2 (low hydrostatic pressure),
  W3 (high hydrostatic pressure)
- EN 1928: Watertightness under hydrostatic pressure — the performance test that validates
  the membrane for its design hydrostatic head; Membriko specifies EN 1928 Method A
  compliance for all underground applications
- NP EN 1992 (Eurocode 2) and NP EN 1997 (Eurocode 7): structural concrete and geotechnical
  standards that govern the substrate the waterproofing is applied to
- NP EN 1998 (Eurocode 8): seismic design standard — waterproofing systems must accommodate
  the deformation values calculated under seismic loading
- Portuguese building code (RGEU — Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas): requires
  waterproofing of underground habitable spaces; does not specify material type, deferring
  to European product standards
- Portaria 353-A/2013: ventilation requirements for buildings, including radon control —
  references gas-retarding membranes as part of compliant solutions

---

## Section 13: Seismic Considerations for Underground Structures in Portugal

**Purpose:** Use Portugal's seismic context as a strong differentiator for EPDM over rigid
waterproofing systems. This section is unique to the Portuguese market context.

**Content:**
- Portugal's seismic risk: one of the highest in Western Europe; Lisbon, Algarve and Alentejo
  in highest hazard zones; IPMA seismic hazard maps
- What seismic loading does to underground structures: inter-storey drift; foundation
  settlement differentials; crack propagation at construction joints; wall/slab junction
  distress
- EPDM's deformation capacity: 400%+ elongation means the membrane can accommodate 50 mm+
  of crack opening at any single point without breach — far beyond what any moderate seismic
  event would demand
- Contrast with rigid systems: cementitious tanking (0.1% elongation) fails at crack widths
  of 0.1-0.2 mm; bentonite panels require confinement that is disrupted by large ground
  movements; PVC membranes (200-300% elongation) are intermediate but less accommodating
  than EPDM
- Design note: Membriko can provide technical confirmation of EPDM deformation capacity
  for inclusion in structural calculations and building permit submissions

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture the specific questions that underground waterproofing clients ask,
many of which reflect concerns about failure consequences and remediation costs.

1. **O que acontece se a membrana EPDM for perfurada por um objecto durante a construção?**
   EPDM underground membranes can be repaired during construction before the protection board
   is placed. Any visible damage is identified by walk-over inspection and repaired with a
   bonded EPDM patch plus QuickSeam lap. Membriko performs a final inspection of the complete
   membrane surface before protection board installation and backfill.

2. **A membrana EPDM é adequada para pisos subterrâneos com pressão hidrostática elevada?**
   Yes. Underground-grade EPDM from Membriko is rated to EN 1928 Method A at 200 kPa — the
   equivalent of 20 metres of water head. For standard basements (2-5 m depth), this provides
   a safety factor of 4 to 10 times the design hydrostatic pressure.

3. **Qual a diferença entre a impermeabilização pré-aplicada e pós-aplicada em subterrâneos?**
   Pre-applied (blind-side) systems are installed on the earth-retaining structure before
   the concrete is poured, with the membrane bonding to the green concrete. Post-applied
   systems are applied to the completed concrete after stripping. Pre-applied is used when
   the external face is not accessible after construction (piled walls, top-down construction).
   Membriko designs and executes both systems.

4. **O EPDM protege contra o gás radão em zonas de risco em Portugal?**
   Yes. EPDM is recognised in Portuguese and European technical guidance (DGS, BRE 211) as
   an effective radon-retarding membrane. For sites in high-radon zones (Beira Interior,
   Trás-os-Montes, Serra da Estrela), Membriko specifies the EPDM in combination with a
   sub-floor passive depressurisation system for full radon mitigation compliance.

5. **A membrana EPDM resiste aos químicos agressivos presentes em solos contaminados?**
   EPDM has excellent resistance to sulphates (EA1-EA4 exposure classes per EN 206),
   chlorides, organic acids and petroleum hydrocarbons. For sites with known chemical
   contamination — former industrial land, petrol stations, landfill margins — Membriko
   performs a chemical compatibility assessment based on the site investigation report
   before specifying the waterproofing system.

6. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para impermeabilização de estruturas subterrâneas?**
   Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty for all underground waterproofing work.
   This warranty is supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product warranty and to the
   10-year statutory defects period for civil engineering structures under Portuguese law
   (Decreto-Lei 273/2003 and Código Civil). Warranty documentation is provided at project
   practical completion.

7. **Como é feita a impermeabilização dos pontos de passagem de tubagens e cabos?**
   All service penetrations through the EPDM membrane are sealed with pre-formed EPDM pipe
   boots (for circular penetrations) or purpose-made flanged collars mechanically secured
   with EPDM compression rings. No silicone or mastic is used as a primary seal. For complex
   penetration clusters (multi-cable ducts, valve stems), Membriko fabricates custom-formed
   EPDM details in workshop before site installation.

8. **O EPDM pode ser instalado em subterrâneos já existentes que estão a infiltrar água?**
   Remediation of existing leaking basements with EPDM is technically possible in most cases
   but requires careful preparation. Active water ingress must be stopped with hydraulic
   repair mortar before membrane installation. Membriko conducts a full diagnostic survey
   of existing failing waterproofing before proposing a remediation solution, which may
   include EPDM lining of the internal face (interior tanking) when external access is
   impossible.
