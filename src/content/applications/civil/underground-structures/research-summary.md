# Underground Structures — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Underground Waterproofing: Core Chemistry and Relevance

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is particularly well-suited to underground waterproofing
because the conditions belowground — permanent contact with groundwater, hydrostatic pressure,
soil chemistry, and absence of UV exposure — play directly to the material's strongest properties.
Underground applications are arguably the most demanding waterproofing context because failure is
invisible, remediation is extremely expensive, and the consequences of water ingress — structural
reinforcement corrosion, settlement, interior flooding — are long-term and cumulative.

The fundamental requirement for underground waterproofing is a membrane that:
- Resists continuous immersion in groundwater of variable chemistry (pH 4.5-9.0 depending on
  geology and contamination)
- Withstands permanent hydrostatic pressure that varies with the water table depth and seasonal
  fluctuations
- Accommodates structural movement from ground settlement, seismic activity and thermal cycles
  without cracking or delaminating
- Is resistant to soil-borne chemicals including sulphates, chlorides, organic acids and, in
  contaminated sites, hydrocarbons and aggressive industrial leachates
- Maintains integrity for the planned service life of the structure — typically 50 to 100 years
  for civil infrastructure

EPDM's molecular architecture delivers all of these requirements through the same saturated
carbon-carbon backbone chemistry that makes it durable above ground. Underground, the absence
of UV exposure means one of the few degradation mechanisms active above ground is eliminated,
and the intrinsic chemical resistance of EPDM becomes the primary performance driver.

## Hydrostatic Pressure Resistance

Hydrostatic pressure is the defining physical challenge for underground waterproofing. Every
metre of water depth (or equivalent height of saturated ground above the structure) creates
approximately 10 kPa (0.1 bar) of hydrostatic pressure. For a basement at 3 m depth in a
high water table site, the pressure at the base slab is approximately 30 kPa. For a metro
station at 15 m depth, pressures can reach 150 kPa or higher.

EPDM membranes used for underground applications are tested to EN 1928 (Method A — full
immersion under hydrostatic pressure) and EN 12310-2 (tear resistance). Critical properties
for hydrostatic resistance:

- **Tensile strength:** ≥ 9-12 N/mm² depending on grade — prevents membrane rupture under
  differential pressure
- **Elongation at break:** ≥ 350-450% — allows the membrane to deform around substrate
  imperfections, construction joints and crack movements without tearing
- **Hydrostatic watertightness:** pass at 60-200 kPa depending on specification (EN 1928)
- **Thickness:** underground grades typically 1.2-2.0 mm; for deep structures and high
  hydrostatic pressure applications, 1.5 mm minimum, 2.0 mm for critical infrastructure

The distinction between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic waterproofing is critical in underground
construction. Non-hydrostatic waterproofing (e.g. simple damp-proofing) is suitable only for
structures above the permanent water table. Any structure that may at any time be subject to
groundwater pressure — even seasonally — requires a fully hydrostatic waterproofing system.
EPDM delivers this, whereas many competing systems (cementitious coatings, crystalline systems)
have limitations at sustained high hydrostatic pressure.

## Installation Systems: Pre-Applied and Post-Applied

Underground waterproofing EPDM is installed using two primary methodological approaches,
each with specific technical rationale:

### Pre-Applied (Blind-Side) Systems

Pre-applied waterproofing is installed on the temporary formwork or earthwork face before
the structural concrete is placed. The membrane is mechanically fixed to the excavation support
(sheet piling, shotcrete lagging, or formwork) with the bonding side facing inward. When the
concrete is poured, the slab or wall bonds directly to the inner face of the membrane.

Advantages:
- No water path between membrane and concrete in the event of localised damage (the membrane
  is bonded to the structure by the concrete itself)
- Suitable for piled walls and situations where the external face of the structure is not
  accessible after construction
- Eliminates the risk of hydrostatic uplift of the membrane before backfilling

Pre-applied EPDM typically uses modified EPDM sheets with a fleece backing on the concrete-
contact side to improve adhesion to the green concrete. The system must comply with:
- EN 13967: Flexible sheets for waterproofing — plastic and rubber sheets for damp-proofing
  (includes underground use classification)
- EN 1928: Watertightness under hydrostatic pressure

### Post-Applied (Fully Adhered) Systems

Post-applied waterproofing is applied to the prepared external surface of the completed
structural concrete, before backfilling. This is the more common approach for basements
and structures with accessible external faces during construction.

The post-applied EPDM is bonded to the concrete with immersion-rated contact adhesive or
torch-applied using appropriate grades. The fully-adhered system (no air gap between membrane
and substrate) is critical for underground applications: any un-bonded area becomes a
potential conduit for water migration if the membrane is breached at a single point.

### Sandwich / Protected Membrane Systems

In some underground applications — particularly inverted terrace-style basements, accessible
vaults and maintenance chambers — the EPDM is installed in a sandwich configuration:
structural slab → drainage layer → EPDM membrane → protection board → backfill or screed.
The drainage layer (geocomposite or granular) relieves hydrostatic pressure by directing
water to collection drains, reducing the working pressure on the membrane.

## Tanking Systems

"Tanking" refers to the concept of creating a continuous, jointless waterproof envelope around
a structure — the structure is conceptually "inside a tank" of waterproofing. EPDM is
particularly well-suited to tanking because:

1. **Single-membrane continuity:** EPDM is available in sheets up to 15.25 m wide and can
   be factory-joined into panels of essentially unlimited size, minimising site-made seams
2. **Cold-applied jointing:** QuickSeam tape-based seaming system creates joints without
   heat (no open flame near excavations, no torch permits required) that achieve the same
   performance as the parent membrane
3. **Corner and detail continuity:** pre-formed EPDM corners, pipe boots and penetration
   collars create the same molecular-level bond at all singularities
4. **Wrap-around details:** EPDM can be folded around the footing edge and across the base
   slab in a single continuous sheet, eliminating the most common leak path in tanked
   basements — the wall/slab junction

The alternative tanking approaches — cementitious slurry, sodium bentonite panels, crystalline
coatings — each have specific failure modes that EPDM avoids. Cementitious tanking is rigid
and cracks with structural movement; bentonite requires full lateral confinement and fails
when the bentonite desiccates in dried-out granular fill; crystalline coatings work by active
chemical reaction that requires ongoing moisture and fails in dry periods.

## Radon and Methane Gas Protection

Underground structures face a hazard beyond water: soil gas. Two gases are of primary concern:

### Radon (Rn-222)

Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium-238 in granite
and other uranium-bearing rocks and soils. It is colourless, odourless and chemically inert
but radiologically hazardous: indoor radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after
smoking in Europe (WHO/IARC classification).

Portugal has significant radon-affected areas, particularly:
- Serra da Estrela and Beira Interior (granite geology)
- Trás-os-Montes (uranium-rich granites)
- Alentejo (specific geological formations)
- Greater Lisbon area (certain geological contexts)

EPDM provides effective radon gas retardation. Key performance data:
- Radon diffusion coefficient through 1.5 mm EPDM: approximately 2 × 10⁻¹² m²/s
- This corresponds to a Radon Equivalent Thickness (RET) of approximately 200-400 mm of
  concrete — significant gas retardation
- EPDM is specifically listed in UK BRE guidance (BRE 211, Report 221) and EU member state
  radon protection guidance as an effective radon-retarding membrane
- Portuguese Portaria 353-A/2013 and subsequent technical guidance (URSN, DGS) recognises
  gas-retarding membranes as part of compliant radon mitigation in new construction

### Methane and Landfill Gas

Sites with organic contamination, historic landfill, or near active/closed waste facilities
may produce methane (CH₄), carbon dioxide (CO₂) and trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
These gases are explosive at certain concentrations (methane: 5-15% v/v LEL) and toxic.

EPDM provides effective gas retardation for methane and CO₂. For high-risk sites (former
landfill, gas works, petrol station redevelopments), the EPDM membrane system is combined
with:
- Gas-venting geocomposite drainage layer beneath the membrane
- Passive venting risers to atmosphere
- Active extraction where passive venting is insufficient
- Gas-tight service entry collars at all penetrations

The Portuguese regulatory framework for construction on contaminated land is governed by
Decreto-Lei 147/2008 and sector-specific guidance from APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente).
EPDM gas-retarding membranes comply with the material requirements specified in these
frameworks.

## Underground Structure Types in Portugal

### Basements in Urban Construction

The Portuguese urban construction market — particularly in Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and coastal
cities — routinely requires basement construction for residential and commercial buildings.
Basement floors in Portuguese cities often encounter the water table at depths of 2-6 m,
particularly in the alluvial zones (Baixa de Lisboa, Ribeira do Porto, coastal urban areas).

Typical basement waterproofing specification in Portugal follows either the "white box"
(self-waterproofing concrete with crystalline additives) or the "black box" (applied membrane
waterproofing) approach. EPDM belongs to the black box category and is specified for:
- High water table sites where hydrostatic resistance is the primary requirement
- Sites with aggressive groundwater (marine influence, industrial zones)
- Structures requiring long service life with minimal maintenance

### Underground Car Parks (Parques de Estacionamento Subterrâneos)

Underground car parks are among the most technically demanding waterproofing applications
because they combine:
- High hydrostatic pressure (typically 2-5 m water table depth)
- Aggressive chemical exposure: chloride-laden runoff from vehicles (road salt, marine
  aerosols in coastal cities), fuel and oil contamination, cleaning agents
- Heavy traffic loading that transmits dynamic stresses through the slab to the membrane
- Drainage requirements at vehicle level that create multiple penetration points

EPDM for underground car park waterproofing is specified at 1.5-2.0 mm, fully adhered to the
structural concrete, with heavy-duty protection board (minimum 8 mm HDPE or 20 mm extruded
polystyrene) above the membrane to resist traffic-transmitted loading. Drain sumps and column
penetrations are detailed with pre-formed EPDM accessories.

### Metro Stations and Tunnels

Metro and railway tunnel construction represents the highest-specification underground
waterproofing application. Structures at 15-30 m depth under urban areas face:
- Hydrostatic pressures of 150-300 kPa
- Permanent full-immersion conditions in many sections
- Sensitivity to any leakage (corrosion of structural elements, electrical safety of rail
  systems, water damage to station finishes and equipment)
- Essentially zero-tolerance for remediation once buried (prohibitive cost and disruption)

The Lisbon and Porto metro systems have utilised EPDM-based waterproofing systems in their
expansion sections. The specifications typically call for:
- 2.0 mm EPDM, pre-applied or post-applied depending on tunnel construction method
- Factory-welded panels to minimise site seams
- Full-height waterproofing continuity from invert to crown
- Independent hydraulic testing of completed sections before backfill or lining installation

### Utility Vaults and Maintenance Chambers

Underground utility infrastructure — telecommunications vaults, electrical substations, valve
chambers, inspection chambers — requires robust waterproofing in structures that are typically
smaller than basements but equally exposed to groundwater and that contain sensitive equipment.

EPDM is specified for utility vaults because:
- Installation is achievable in confined spaces (EPDM is flexible, cold-applied, no flame
  equipment required)
- Chemical resistance to the soil environments typical of utility corridors (often disturbed
  fill with variable chemistry)
- Long service life aligned with the 40-60 year infrastructure asset life cycle
- Compatibility with cathodic protection systems on metallic utility infrastructure

  including underground applications. Covers performance classes (W1-W3 for water exposure)
- **EN 1928:** Flexible sheets for waterproofing — Watertightness. Method A (full immersion
  under hydrostatic pressure) and Method B (vacuum-based test). Underground applications
  require Method A compliance.

  in conjunction with drainage geocomposites and protection layers in underground systems.
- **NP EN 206:** Concrete for underground structures (Portuguese national standard adoption).
  Governs the concrete substrate quality that the waterproofing system is applied to.

## Portuguese Seismic Context

Portugal has one of the highest seismic risks in Western Europe. The Lisbon earthquake of
1755 (estimated magnitude 8.5-9.0) destroyed the city and generated a tsunami. Modern seismic
risk maps (Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera, IPMA; Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia
Civil, LNEC) classify most of Portugal south of the Tagus and the Algarve in the highest
seismic hazard zones in continental Europe.

For underground structures, seismic loading creates:
- Inter-storey drift between floors (relative movement between walls and slabs)
- Foundation settlement differentials
- Ground liquefaction in coastal alluvial zones (Lisbon waterfront, Algarve coastal plain)
- Crack propagation in concrete structures at construction joints and wall-slab junctions

EPDM's 400%+ elongation provides a substantial accommodation reserve for seismically-induced
structural movements. The membrane absorbs differential movement of several centimetres at
crack locations without breach — no rigid waterproofing system (cementitious, crystalline)
can match this deformation capacity. For seismic zones, this is not an academic point: it is
the difference between a waterproofing system that survives a moderate earthquake intact and
one that requires immediate remediation.

The design standard for seismic resistance of structures in Portugal is NP EN 1998-1
(Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance) which specifies minimum
deformation capacity requirements for structural elements. Waterproofing systems specified
for high-seismic-zone structures must accommodate the inter-storey drift values calculated
by the structural engineer — typically 10-50 mm at crack or joint locations.

## Competitive Landscape: EPDM vs Alternative Underground Waterproofing Systems

### Sodium Bentonite Panels (GCL — Geosynthetic Clay Liners)

Bentonite panels consist of sodium bentonite granules sandwiched between two geotextile layers.
When wetted, bentonite swells to form a low-permeability clay barrier. Technical limitations:

- **Desiccation:** bentonite loses its swollen, low-permeability state when the moisture
  supply is interrupted. In sites that temporarily dry out (above water table in dry seasons),
  bentonite panels crack and may not re-seal completely when rewetted.
- **Calcium ion exchange:** groundwater with high calcium content (hard water, marine
  influence) replaces sodium in the bentonite with calcium, converting the bentonite from
  sodium (high swelling, low permeability) to calcium form (low swelling, higher permeability).
  This is an irreversible degradation mechanism.
- **Lateral confinement requirement:** bentonite requires full lateral confinement to develop
  sealing pressure; at edges, joints and around penetrations, this confinement is compromised.
- **Chemical resistance:** concentrated sulphates, acids and hydrocarbons can degrade bentonite
  performance; EPDM has superior chemical resistance in contaminated ground.

### PVC Membranes

PVC waterproofing membranes are available in underground grades (typically 1.5-2.0 mm,
unreinforced or fabric-reinforced). Limitations in underground applications:
- Plasticiser migration: soil organisms (particularly in organic soils) can accelerate
  plasticiser extraction from PVC, leading to embrittlement over 20-30 year timescales
- Temperature sensitivity: PVC becomes brittle below -10°C; in northern Portugal underground
  conditions this is a marginal concern but relevant for structures with exposed sections
- Chemical resistance: PVC is less resistant than EPDM to hydrocarbons (relevant for
  contaminated sites and car park applications)
- Heat welding required for seams: torch or hot-air welding in confined underground excavations
  creates safety and permit requirements; EPDM cold-applied seaming is safer in confined spaces

### Cementitious Waterproofing (Slurry and Crystalline)

Cementitious waterproofing systems — crystalline admixtures, crystalline surface coatings,
hydraulic cement slurries — work by filling concrete pores with crystalline reaction products.
Fundamental limitations:
- Zero crack bridging capability: brittle system with <0.1% elongation; any structural crack
  propagates through the cementitious coating
- Active water requirement: crystalline systems require permanent moisture to sustain crystal
  growth; in partially-dry conditions, self-healing does not occur
- Thickness limitation: cementitious coatings are typically 1-3 mm; their effectiveness
  diminishes significantly at higher hydrostatic pressures

For structures in seismically active zones — which includes the majority of southern Portugal —
cementitious waterproofing as a primary system is not recommended by LNEC.

### HDPE Membranes (High-Density Polyethylene)

HDPE geomembranes (typically 1.0-2.0 mm) are used in underground waterproofing, particularly
in environmental containment applications. Compared to EPDM:
- Lower elongation at break (typically 700-900% in flat-sheet HDPE, but only 5-15% in the
  rigid-behaviour zone at operating stress levels)
- Requires heat fusion welding (extrusion or hot-wedge), requiring specialist equipment
- Higher stiffness — less conformable to irregular substrate geometry
- Longer track record in environmental containment; EPDM has longer track record in building
  waterproofing applications specifically

EPDM is generally preferred in building basement waterproofing; HDPE in environmental
containment and large civil infrastructure (tunnels, dams).
