# Bridge Deck Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## What Lies Beneath the Asphalt Determines the Life of the Structure

Bridges are among the most structurally unforgiving environments for a waterproofing membrane. Unlike a building roof — where a failure manifests as a visible leak, prompting swift repair — a bridge deck membrane fails invisibly, concealed beneath asphalt surfacing, while chloride-laden drainage water silently penetrates the concrete deck, corrodes the reinforcement steel, and progressively undermines the structural capacity of the bridge. By the time the deterioration becomes visible at the surface — through spalling concrete, rust staining, or surface deformation — the structural damage is already extensive and costly.

Membriko, based in Pombal, Portugal, works exclusively with EPDM rubber membrane because it is the only material that simultaneously delivers the elongation capacity to accommodate bridge deck kinematics, the chemical inertness to resist chloride-laden road drainage, the thermal stability to remain effective beneath permanently elevated temperatures, and the compatibility with hot-applied asphalt overlay. No competing system combines all four of these properties in a single cold-applied, flame-free installation method that aligns with the technical requirements of Infraestruturas de Portugal and the reference standards of LNEC.

This page explains the engineering case for EPDM bridge deck waterproofing with the precision that civil engineers, bridge managers, and public procurement officers require — technical data, regulatory references, and an honest comparison with the alternatives.

## The Portuguese Bridge Network and the Rehabilitation Challenge

Portugal's road infrastructure authority, Infraestruturas de Portugal (IP), manages approximately 12,000 road structures on the national network — bridges, viaducts, grade separations, hydraulic culverts, and underpasses. Beyond the national network, thousands of additional structures sit within municipal road networks under câmara management, including historic masonry arch bridges that have carried traffic across rivers and ravines for centuries.

The period of most intensive bridge construction in Portugal coincided with the expansion of the SCUT motorway network and the national road system, funded largely through European structural funds, between 1970 and 2000. Bridges built during that period — predominantly reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete deck structures spanning 25 to 60 metres — were waterproofed with SBS or APP bitumen sheet systems, torch-applied in thicknesses of 4 to 5 millimetres. Those systems, where they remain without rehabilitation since original construction, are now between 25 and 55 years old — well beyond their design service life of 15 to 25 years.

LNEC and structural engineering research groups at Portuguese universities have documented, with increasing frequency, cases of chloride penetration, concrete carbonation, and reinforcement corrosion in bridges that have not been rehabilitated within the specified timeframe. IP's own bridge asset management programme identifies waterproofing replacement as one of the three highest-priority intervention categories across the national bridge stock.

Membriko is positioned as a technical partner for this rehabilitation challenge: with cold-installation methodology requiring no open flame, compliance with IP technical specifications and LNEC reference standards, and the project management capability to execute works in coordination with traffic management plans on bridges carrying live traffic.

## Why EPDM is the Correct Membrane for Bridge Decks

The answer to this question lies in the physics and chemistry of bridge movement. Bridges are not static structures: they move continuously, in multiple directions, in response to forces that no rigid material can accommodate indefinitely.

### Thermal Expansion of the Deck Slab

A 50-metre concrete deck span expands approximately 30 to 35 millimetres between winter minimum and summer maximum temperatures in Portugal's continental interior — a seasonal temperature range of 55 to 65°C at deck level. This expansion is accommodated by expansion joints at the bridge ends, but intermediate thermal strain distributes across the full deck length, imposing continuous longitudinal deformation on the waterproofing membrane.

An SBS bitumen sheet system, with an elongation at break of 30 to 50%, accommodates this movement adequately when newly installed. However, after 10 to 15 years of service, progressive oxidation and embrittlement reduce available elongation to values that can no longer guarantee membrane integrity through extreme thermal cycles. EPDM, with elongation of 300 to 400%, maintains this capacity across a design service life of 50 or more years, without significant loss of mechanical properties.

### Live Load Deflection

A 40-tonne heavy goods vehicle crossing a 30-metre span bridge deflects the deck 8 to 15 millimetres at midspan. This deflection occurs and reverses in the order of seconds, at the frequency of vehicle passage. On a bridge carrying 5,000 heavy vehicles per day, the waterproofing membrane undergoes approximately 1.8 million deformation cycles per year — 90 million over a 50-year design life.

This is the context in which EPDM's fatigue resistance is decisive. EPDM is a thermoset elastomer: after deformation, it recovers its original geometry without accumulated permanent set. Liquid polyurethane membranes, which represent one of the more widely used alternatives in Portuguese bridge rehabilitation, are susceptible to fatigue micro-cracking under repeated cyclical loading, requiring periodic recoating every 10 to 15 years — an ongoing maintenance intervention that makes their whole-life cost significantly greater than EPDM when considered over any time horizon beyond 20 years.

### Differential Movement at Expansion Joints and Abutments

Expansion joints and bridge abutments concentrate the accumulated movement of the entire structure. On a 100-metre bridge, total joint movement can reach 60 to 80 millimetres. This is the most critical singular point in any bridge waterproofing system: where failure is most common, where water finds its path to the structural concrete most readily, and where the combination of maximum movement and reduced protection by the asphalt overlay is most unfavourable.

Membriko details this singular point with an EPDM reinforcement strip of appropriate width — typically 300 to 500 millimetres on each side of the joint — with sufficient slack to accommodate the design movement, and with fully adhered seams that distribute deformation across the reinforcement strip rather than concentrating it at a point. This detail is drawn specifically for each joint, based on design movement values provided by the structural engineer.

### Vibration and High-Frequency Fatigue

In addition to the large-amplitude movements described above, bridge decks are subject to high-frequency vibration induced by traffic. These vibrations impose small-amplitude, high-frequency deformation cycles on the membrane — precisely the regime that promotes micro-cracking in materials with viscoelastic or thermoplastic behaviour. Vulcanised EPDM, as a thermoset elastomer, dissipates elastic energy without crack propagation: it deforms under load and recovers without fatigue accumulation.

### Compatibility with Asphalt

The bridge deck waterproofing membrane is in permanent contact with the asphalt overlay above it. This coexistence places chemical compatibility demands that eliminate several membrane systems from consideration:

PVC is chemically incompatible with the oily fractions of fresh bitumen: plasticiser migration from PVC into bitumen accelerates membrane embrittlement and weakens the bond interface. Several TPO formulations are similarly incompatible with bitumen and require separation layers that complicate the system build-up. EPDM is chemically inert to bituminous compounds. There is no chemical reaction between vulcanised EPDM rubber and the bituminous and oleic fractions of asphalt — which ensures the stability of the membrane-asphalt interface across the full design service life.

Compatibility extends beyond chemical inertness: EPDM accepts, over its surface, the application of bituminous tack coat systems required to develop adequate shear bond between the asphalt overlay and the waterproofing membrane — a critical mechanical performance parameter evaluated under EN 14224 (shear resistance at the membrane-asphalt interface).

## Bridge Types — Membriko's Approach for Each Structure

The diversity of Portugal's bridge inventory demands technical flexibility. Membriko has methodology and experience adapted to each structural type.

### Reinforced and Prestressed Concrete Deck

This is the most common type on the national network managed by IP: solid slabs, precast prestressed beams with composite deck slab, prestressed box girder decks. The concrete surface is generally regular and suitable for fully adhered EPDM membrane installation using water-based or low-VOC solvent-based contact adhesive.

Membriko applies a fully adhered system on these decks — EPDM membrane at 1.5 to 2.0 millimetres thickness, bonded over a two-component epoxy or polyurethane primer applied to the prepared concrete surface. Full adhesion eliminates the possibility of sub-membrane water migration in the event of localised damage — a significant advantage for a surface that cannot be inspected beneath the asphalt once the road is reinstated.

### Steel Deck Bridges

Road bridges and railway bridges with steel decks present an additional challenge: the coefficient of thermal expansion of steel (12 × 10⁻⁶ /°C) is substantially higher than that of concrete (10 × 10⁻⁶ /°C), generating larger thermal movements that demand greater elongation capacity from the membrane. Additionally, the steel surface requires corrosion protection before membrane application.

Membriko applies a mechanically fastened or cold-adhered EPDM system over certified anti-corrosion primer on these decks, with deformation allowances appropriate to the movement amplitudes calculated for the structure. Seams are fabricated with EPDM butyl adhesive tape, which maintains watertightness without stiffening the seam interface.

### Masonry Arch and Historic Bridges

Portugal has a remarkable inventory of stone masonry arch bridges — from medieval bridges in the Minho to Roman bridges in the Alentejo — many of them classified as National Monuments or Monuments of Public Interest by the Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage (DGPC). These structures remain in active service, carrying road or pedestrian traffic on arches built centuries ago.

The waterproofing of historic bridges combines technical performance requirements with heritage conservation constraints that do not exist for contemporary structures. Membriko has a specific methodology for this context.

Open-flame application of any waterproofing system is prohibited in virtually all cases for historic masonry structures: heat causes differential thermal expansion in stones and mortars, potentially causing cracking or detachment of historic material. Membriko applies only cold-process EPDM on historic bridges — no torch, no process heat, no risk to historic stonework.

Adhesives and primers used on historic substrates are formulations free of solvents aggressive to limestone, granite, or lime mortars — the predominant materials in Portuguese historic bridges. Compatibility is verified on laboratory samples before application on site.

---

## Bridge Deck Movement and EPDM Flexibility: The Arithmetic of Safety

To make the technical argument concrete, Membriko presents an illustrative deformation analysis for a typical Portuguese bridge.

**Illustrative calculation — concrete bridge, 40-metre span, mainland Portugal:**

- Seasonal deck temperature range: 55°C (from -5°C in winter to +50°C at deck surface in August)
- Coefficient of thermal expansion of concrete: 10 × 10⁻⁶ /°C
- Total thermal elongation: 40,000 mm × 10 × 10⁻⁶ × 55°C = 22 mm

Distributing this deformation across the deck length, the maximum unit strain at midspan is approximately 0.055% (0.55 mm per 1,000 mm of membrane). This is trivial relative to EPDM's elongation at break of 300 to 400% — which means the membrane has a safety factor of more than 500 times against the thermal expansion demand of a 40-metre concrete span.

Live load deflection adds localised strains of comparable order of magnitude. Even summing all demands, the EPDM membrane operates at a very small fraction of its deformation capacity — which explains the absence of fatigue accumulation over decades of service.

By contrast, an SBS bitumen sheet with 30% elongation (300 mm per 1,000 mm) has a safety factor ten times smaller — a margin that, as properties degrade progressively with service time, can become insufficient under thermal and live load extremes coinciding with aged material properties.

## Installation Process — Bridge-Specific Approach

Bridge deck waterproofing is not simply a membrane application exercise: it is a civil engineering site operation that demands traffic management, work at height over traffic or waterways, coordination with the road authority and the client's technical supervision team, and a rigorous quality management system. Membriko has processes designed specifically for these demands.

### 1. Survey, Diagnosis, and Design

Before any site work begins, Membriko carries out a comprehensive technical survey: concrete core extraction for carbonation depth and chloride profiling, visual inspection of the existing waterproofing where accessible, geometric survey of the deck, and identification of all singular points — drainage outlets, expansion joints, kerbs, abutment interfaces. From this diagnostic, a waterproofing design is prepared with material specification, construction sequence, and programme.

### 2. Traffic Management Plan and Site Safety

For bridges in service, Membriko prepares or coordinates preparation of the Traffic Management Plan (Plano de Gestão de Tráfego) in coordination with the road authority (IP or câmara). The Health and Safety Plan (Plano de Segurança e Saúde) is mandatory under DL 273/2003 (amended by DL 41/2015) and covers the specific hazards of work at height over live traffic or over watercourses. Membriko personnel hold certified competencies for work at height and in restricted-access environments.

### 3. Removal of Existing Membrane and Concrete Repair

Cold milling of the existing asphalt and removal of the existing waterproofing membrane are carried out by mechanical or manual means, depending on access constraints and the need to preserve the structural deck. The exposed concrete is inspected for carbonation zones, inadequate cover, and corroded reinforcement. Structural repairs are executed to EN 1504 (concrete structure repair): reinforcement cleaning and passivation treatment, structural repair mortar by spray or formwork.

### 4. Substrate Preparation

The prepared concrete surface is treated with high-pressure water jet or grit-blast cleaning, followed by surface pull-off resistance testing. EN 12188 (adhesion by pull-off) is applied with a minimum value of 0.08 N/mm² before adhesive membrane bonding is authorised. Epoxy or water-based polyurethane primer is then applied to the clean, dry concrete surface to create the bonding interface between concrete and EPDM adhesive.

### 5. EPDM Membrane Installation

EPDM membrane rolls of width appropriate to the deck geometry — typically 3.05 to 6.10 metres — are unrolled over the deck and positioned with longitudinal seams running in the direction of traffic, to minimise seam exposure to transverse deformation. Seams are fabricated at a minimum 75-millimetre overlap, primed with butyl contact primer and bonded with high-strength contact adhesive, ensuring watertightness of the complete system.

Singular points — drainage outlets, expansion joints, kerbs, abutment interfaces — are executed with prefabricated EPDM accessories and butyl sealing tape. No exposed mastic is used as permanent sealing at any location on bridge waterproofing: Membriko's technical specification prohibits mastic as a structural sealing component because it degrades under the movement regime of a bridge structure.

### 6. Watertightness Testing by Electronic Leak Detection

Before the tack coat and asphalt overlay are authorised, the entire waterproofed surface is subjected to electronic leak detection (ELD) at high or low voltage. The ELD system traverses the full membrane area and identifies any pinhole, unsealed seam, or inadequately sealed penetration — defects that are invisible to visual inspection. Membriko carries out ELD testing over 100% of membrane area as a mandatory step before any surface preparation for asphalt overlay. The test record is documented and submitted to the client as part of the quality assurance file.

### 7. Tack Coat Application and Asphalt Overlay Coordination

The bituminous tack coat is applied over the dry, clean EPDM surface at the application rates recommended by the tack coat manufacturer for elastic substrates. Hot-mix asphalt overlay is coordinated with the asphalt contractor to ensure that the temperature at the membrane interface does not exceed 160°C for more than 30 seconds at any point — a condition managed by the paving sequence, lift thickness, and the mix specification.

---

## Drainage Integration

Deck drainage is a critical element of bridge waterproofing that must be integrated into the membrane system, not treated as an afterthought. A technically excellent membrane with poor drainage detailing is a membrane that will accumulate water at localised low points, generating hydrostatic pressure at the concrete interface and accelerating deterioration in the zones of lowest gradient.

### Deck Slope Geometry

A bridge deck must maintain a minimum transverse cross-fall of 2% towards the drainage outlets at kerb level. Longitudinal gradient is determined by the road alignment. Membriko verifies, during the survey, that the repaired concrete deck maintains the design drainage geometry — and where necessary, proposes mortar regularisation to restore adequate gradients before membrane installation.

### Drainage Outlet Details

Each deck drainage outlet receives a prefabricated EPDM collar that laps and is bonded to the main membrane. This collar ensures waterproofing continuity from the deck surface to the outlet throat, with no exposed concrete between the membrane and the outlet body. The alternative — sealing the annular gap between outlet and membrane with mastic — is rejected by Membriko for bridge applications because mastic cannot accommodate the movement of the bridge structure without cracking and losing its seal over time.

### Kerb Scupper Details

Water outlets at precast or cast-in-situ concrete kerbs require the membrane to be turned up behind the kerb, forming a flashing that prevents water from bypassing the kerb at the base and reaching the beam or slab concrete. Membriko executes this upstand flashing with a minimum 100-millimetre turn-up, fully bonded to the kerb concrete and sealed at the top with butyl tape.

## EPDM versus Competing Systems for Bridge Decks

The selection of bridge deck waterproofing in Portugal is typically influenced by the client's reference specification, the main contractor's established relationships, and installed cost. Membriko presents an objective comparison of the principal competing systems.

| Feature | EPDM | SBS Bitumen Sheet | Liquid PU Membrane | Epoxy Resin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proven service life in bridges | 50+ years | 15–25 years | 10–15 years | Not waterproofing |
| Elongation at break | 300–400% | 30–50% | 200–300% | < 5% |
| Flexibility at -10°C | Full | Reduced | Variable | Brittle |
| Compatibility with hot asphalt | Full | Full | Variable | Not applicable |
| Installation method | Cold — no flame | Torch or cold | Spray — solvents | Roller/squeegee |
| Fatigue resistance under traffic | Excellent | Moderate | Limited | Poor |

SBS bitumen sheet remains the reference system in older IP specifications and has an established track record for short-span bridges with moderate movement demands. EPDM's advantage is most pronounced on long-span bridges, steel decks, and historic structures where cold application is required. Liquid PU membranes offer the operational advantage of application without a full lane closure in some configurations, but their limited service life and the need for periodic recoating make their whole-life cost considerably greater than EPDM over any planning horizon beyond 20 years.

## Durability Under Asphalt: The Evidence Base for the Specification

The question that bridge engineers most frequently put to Membriko is straightforward: "If the membrane is buried and inaccessible, how do we know it will last 50 years?"

The answer rests on three independent lines of evidence.

**The ERA 30-year field study.** The EPDM Roofing Association examined five EPDM membranes that had been in continuous service for 28 to 32 years, extracting core samples and analysing residual mechanical properties. Retained elongation values ranged from 180 to 240% — values that represent, relative to the deformation demands of a typical bridge deck, a safety factor essentially identical to that of the membrane when new. No delamination, oxidative micro-cracking, or loss of watertightness was detected in any sample.

**The SKZ accelerated ageing study.** The Suddeutsches Kunststoff-Zentrum tested 39 EPDM samples from European installations using Arrhenius methodology to project service life. The median projected service life across all samples exceeded 50 years under Central European exposure conditions. Applying this methodology to the bridge context — where the membrane is shielded from direct UV by the asphalt overlay, but exposed to permanently elevated temperature — the absence of UV (the primary degrading agent for above-ground membranes) and the moderately elevated temperature broadly offset each other, yielding projected service lives equally in excess of 50 years.

**The absence of plasticisers as a guarantee of stability.** PVC installed in the same deck position ages under a permanently elevated temperature of 40 to 60°C, which accelerates plasticiser migration. After 15 to 20 years, PVC beneath asphalt may have lost 20 to 40% of its plasticiser content through migration into the adjacent bitumen — becoming rigid precisely in the environment (elevated temperature combined with cyclical movement) where flexibility is most critical. EPDM has no plasticisers to lose. Its chemical composition remains stable beneath the asphalt throughout the design service life.

## Maintenance Under Traffic

One of the less widely discussed advantages of EPDM for bridge waterproofing is its minimal impact on the long-term maintenance programme. Once installed and covered with asphalt, the EPDM membrane requires no maintenance intervention during its 50-year design life — in contrast to liquid PU membranes, which require recoating every 10 to 15 years, and in contrast to SBS bitumen systems, which typically require full replacement at 15 to 25 years.

The maintenance plan that Membriko delivers with each bridge project includes:

**Biennial visual inspection** of drainage outlets, kerbs, and water outlets — carried out by the bridge manager without requiring pavement opening.

**Five-yearly detailed inspection** aligned with IP's principal inspection cycle, including watertightness testing by electronic leak detection in accessible zones (abutments, drainage areas, expansion joint details).

**Localised repair** in the event of accidental damage: Membriko carries out EPDM patch repairs with localised pavement opening, without full membrane replacement.

The as-built documentation delivered to the bridge manager includes a scaled record drawing showing the position of all seams, drainage outlets, and singular point details — a reference that enables any future damage to be precisely located and repaired without unnecessary opening of the full waterproofed area.

## Portuguese Bridge Regulations

Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable in public procurement. Membriko has detailed knowledge of the regulatory framework applicable to bridge waterproofing in Portugal.

**Infraestruturas de Portugal Technical Specifications (ET series).** IP's ET specifications define material and installation requirements for all interventions on the national road network. Bridge deck waterproofing is covered within the ET series for bridge rehabilitation works. Membriko prepares material specifications and quality assurance plans in compliance with these specifications.

**LNEC E 378.** LNEC's specification for the waterproofing of concrete bridge decks is the national technical reference for this category of work. It defines substrate preparation requirements, waterproofing material characteristics, and quality control testing. Membriko demonstrates conformance with E 378 requirements on all bridge rehabilitation projects.

**EN 13956 — Flexible sheets for waterproofing.** The harmonised European product standard for polymeric waterproofing membranes, adopted in Portugal as NP EN 13956, is the reference product standard for EPDM Type 3 membranes. CE marking under this standard is mandatory for all products placed on the Portuguese market.

**EN 14695 — Waterproofing systems for concrete bridge decks.** The European standard that defines test methods for evaluating bridge deck waterproofing systems, including shear resistance, resistance to dynamic loading, and compatibility with hot-applied asphalt overlay.

**DL 273/2003 / DL 41/2015 — Construction site safety.** The Portuguese legal framework for construction site safety requires a Health and Safety Plan for bridge works. Membriko maintains PSS documentation for each bridge project, adapted to the specific hazards of each structure.

**Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) / Water Law (Lei 58/2005).** For works on bridges over watercourses, APA and the relevant River Basin Authority (ARH) may require a water resource utilisation licence. Membriko coordinates the environmental licensing process and ensures installation methodology complies with permit conditions.

## Rehabilitation of Historic Bridges

Portugal possesses a remarkable inventory of historic masonry arch bridges — from medieval stone bridges in the Minho and Douro valleys to Roman structures in the Alentejo interior — many of them classified as National Monuments or Monuments of Public Interest by the Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage (DGPC). These structures continue in active service, carrying road or pedestrian traffic on arches that have stood for centuries.

Waterproofing historic bridges combines the technical performance demands of bridge waterproofing with heritage conservation constraints that apply to no other category of structure. Membriko has developed specific methodology for this work.

**No flame, no heat.** Open-flame application of any system is prohibited for historic masonry in virtually all cases. Heat application risks differential thermal expansion in stone elements, cracking of historic mortar joints, and detachment of dressed stonework — risks that are categorically unacceptable for classified structures. Membriko applies only cold-process EPDM on historic bridges: no torch, no process heat, no risk to historic fabric.

**Adhesives compatible with lime and natural stone.** Primers and adhesives specified for historic substrates are formulations free from solvents aggressive to limestone, granite, or lime mortar — the predominant materials in Portuguese historic bridges. Compatibility is verified through laboratory testing on representative substrate samples before site application.

**Coordination with DGPC.** Any intervention on a classified monument requires prior authorisation from DGPC. Membriko collaborates with the project architect or engineer in preparing the technical supporting documentation for DGPC submission, covering materials, methods, and the reversibility of the intervention.

**Conformance to irregular surfaces.** Stone masonry, unlike structural concrete, has significant surface irregularity. EPDM's ambient-temperature deformability allows the membrane to conform to these irregularities without air bubbles or unbonded zones — a capability that stiffer bitumen systems cannot match on irregular masonry at moderate temperatures.

---

## Environmental Compliance

Portuguese bridges span rivers, estuaries, and protected wetland habitats — ecologically sensitive environments where the management of construction works is as important as the technical quality of the waterproofing.

**Spill containment.** All work areas over the deck are protected by containment systems that prevent materials, tools, or waste from falling into the watercourse below. Asphalt and membrane waste is collected and directed to recycling or disposal through a licensed waste operator under DL 73/2011 (waste management framework).

**Cold installation — zero bituminous vapour emissions.** Torch application of bituminous systems on bridges over watercourses generates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) vapour emissions that may contaminate the aquatic environment. Membriko's cold-applied EPDM methodology generates no bituminous vapour emissions — a direct environmental advantage that simplifies the permitting process with APA.

**EPDM chemical inertness in contact with water.** Installed vulcanised EPDM is chemically stable: it does not release plasticisers, biocides, or additives into road drainage water or into contact with watercourses. This inertness is relevant under the Water Framework Directive and the environmental quality standards applicable to surface water bodies under Portuguese law.

**Seasonal scheduling relative to aquatic fauna.** For bridges over rivers with protected fish species — Atlantic salmon, lamprey, and barbel in northern Portugal — Membriko proposes concentrating works outside migration and spawning periods, in coordination with conditions specified in the environmental permit issued by the relevant ARH.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can EPDM withstand the temperature of hot-applied asphalt?**

EPDM's upper continuous service temperature is approximately 150°C. Hot-mix asphalt is applied at 140 to 180°C, which means the membrane approaches or marginally exceeds its continuous service limit during paving. For bridge deck projects, Membriko specifies the complete system — membrane, primer, and tack coat — validated for compatibility with hot-mix asphalt overlay. The brief duration of peak temperature exposure, with the asphalt moving across the membrane during spreading, is within EPDM's tolerance when the system is correctly designed and laying temperatures are monitored during overlay operations.

**Can EPDM membrane be installed without closing the bridge to traffic?**

On bridges with two or more traffic lanes, phased installation with lane closures is standard practice. The work sequence — milling, concrete repair, surface preparation, membrane installation, leak test — can be organised in lane-width strips over successive traffic management windows. On single-lane bridges, which are common on Portuguese municipal networks, temporary full closure with signed diversion is required. Membriko coordinates with IP or the relevant câmara for traffic management permits and works notices.

**What is the difference between EPDM and SBS bitumen sheet for bridge decks?**

SBS bitumen sheet is the historically standard system in Portuguese bridge deck waterproofing specifications. It performs adequately on short-span bridges with moderate movement demands and has a service life of 15 to 25 years. EPDM's advantages lie in its substantially higher elongation (300–400% versus 30–50% for SBS), better low-temperature flexibility (effective to -45°C versus approximately -10°C for SBS), and a design service life of 50 or more years. For bridges with high movement demands — long spans, steel decks, or structures in seismically active zones — EPDM is the technically superior choice.

**Does EPDM resist the road salt used on bridges in winter?**

Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to sodium chloride (road salt) and the brine concentrations present in road drainage. The membrane neither absorbs, reacts with, nor degrades in the presence of road salt. Preventing chloride-laden drainage from reaching the reinforced concrete deck and initiating rebar corrosion is precisely the primary structural protection function of bridge deck waterproofing.

**What membrane thickness does Membriko specify for bridge decks?**

For bridge deck waterproofing, Membriko specifies a minimum EPDM thickness of 1.5 millimetres. For high-movement structures — steel decks, long prestressed concrete spans, structures in seismically active zones — the preferred specification is 2.0 millimetres. Thickness selection is documented in the waterproofing design report and forms part of the as-built record submitted to the bridge manager.

**How is watertightness verified before the asphalt is laid?**

Electronic leak detection (ELD) is the standard post-installation test for EPDM bridge deck membranes. The ELD system sweeps the full membrane area and identifies any pinhole, unsealed seam, or inadequately sealed penetration — defects invisible to visual inspection. Membriko carries out ELD testing over 100% of membrane area as a mandatory step before authorising tack coat application and asphalt overlay. The test record is documented and submitted to the client as part of the quality assurance file.

**Is EPDM approved for bridge decks under Infraestruturas de Portugal specifications?**

EPDM sheet membrane, when supplied with CE marking under EN 13956 and tested to EN 14695 methodology, meets the material performance requirements of IP bridge waterproofing technical specifications. For specific IP procurement contracts, Membriko prepares the technical submission demonstrating EN 13956 Type 3 compliance, product test certificates, and installation method statements aligned with IP ET specifications. Where a contract specification references LNEC E 378, Membriko demonstrates equivalent or superior performance against the referenced test methods.

**How long does rehabilitation of a typical bridge waterproofing take?**

Duration depends on deck area, access constraints, and traffic management arrangements. For a typical municipal bridge with a deck area of 200 to 500 square metres under a single-lane closure scheme, the waterproofing cycle — removal, preparation, membrane, leak test — typically takes 3 to 7 working days, with asphalt overlay as a separate subsequent operation. Large motorway viaducts are programmed in stages coordinated with IP's maintenance programming calendar. Membriko provides a detailed programme with every quotation, including the traffic management schedule.
