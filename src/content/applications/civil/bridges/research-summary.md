# Bridges — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Bridge Deck Waterproofing

Bridge deck waterproofing is one of the most structurally critical applications for any membrane system. Unlike building roofs, bridge decks must simultaneously resist constant dynamic loading from vehicle traffic, substantial structural movement from thermal expansion and live loads, chloride-laden drainage water, and freeze-thaw cycles — all while being permanently concealed beneath asphalt surfacing. The waterproofing layer is invisible once the road surface is laid, yet its failure carries catastrophic consequences: chloride ingress to the reinforced concrete deck initiates rebar corrosion, which causes spalling, structural capacity loss, and eventually requires full deck replacement at enormous cost.

EPDM sheet membrane has established itself as the leading system for bridge deck waterproofing in demanding infrastructure applications across Europe. Its combination of exceptional elongation (300–400% at break), wide service temperature range (-45°C to +150°C), complete impermeability to chloride ions, and resistance to the petroleum-based solvents present in fresh asphalt make it uniquely qualified for this environment.

## Bridge Deck Structural Movement — The Defining Challenge

Bridge decks move in ways that building substrates do not. Several distinct movement mechanisms must be accommodated by the waterproofing membrane:

**Thermal expansion of the deck slab.** A 50-metre concrete bridge span expands approximately 30–35 mm between winter minimum and summer maximum temperatures in Portugal's continental interior. This generates longitudinal strain in the deck surface that the membrane must accommodate without tearing or debonding. Expansion joints at the bridge ends concentrate the accumulated thermal movement, but mid-span thermal strain still imposes significant demands on the membrane.

**Live load deflection.** Heavy goods vehicles crossing a bridge deflect the deck vertically. A reinforced concrete deck of typical span (25–40 m) may deflect 5–15 mm at midspan under maximum legal axle loads (Portugal: 11.5 tonnes per axle per EC directive). This vertical deflection creates tensile strain in the membrane on the deck soffit and compressive strain on the top surface — the waterproofed surface. As vehicles cross, these strains cycle at the frequency of traffic passage.

**Differential movement at structure transitions.** The junction between the bridge deck and the abutment is a point of concentrated relative movement: the deck moves, the abutment resists. Waterproofing details at this location must accommodate differential settlement as well as thermal movement, requiring either purpose-designed expansion joint waterproofing details or wide-strip EPDM reinforcement patches.

**Vibration and fatigue.** Traffic-induced vibration subjects the membrane to high-frequency, low-amplitude cyclical loading superimposed on the slower thermal and live load movements. A material that undergoes fatigue under cyclical loading — as some liquid-applied systems do — will eventually develop micro-cracks that propagate under continued traffic. EPDM's thermoset rubber network resists fatigue-induced micro-cracking due to its elastomeric recovery: it deforms under load and returns to its original state without permanent deformation accumulation.

## Performance Under Asphalt Overlay

EPDM membranes used for bridge deck waterproofing must withstand the thermal and mechanical demands of asphalt paving immediately after installation:

**Asphalt laying temperature.** Hot-mix asphalt is applied at 140–180°C. EPDM's upper service temperature of approximately 150°C (continuous) means the membrane approaches its thermal limit during surfacing. For bridge deck applications, this demands a modified EPDM formulation or a specific heat-stable bonding layer that does not debond during surfacing. European practice (particularly in Germany, France, and the Netherlands) specifies a torched-on EPDM or reactive epoxy bonding layer between the EPDM membrane and the asphalt, providing adequate bond strength even under paving temperatures.

**Asphalt bond strength.** The critical performance parameter for bridge deck waterproofing is shear bond strength between the membrane and the asphalt overlay. If the membrane-asphalt interface is insufficiently bonded, the asphalt can slide relative to the deck under braking or acceleration forces, creating surface deformation (rutting, cracking) and ultimately membrane delamination. European standard BS EN 14223 and the German ZTV-ING specification define minimum shear bond strength requirements. Tack coats and primers applied over the EPDM surface prior to asphalt laying are mandatory elements of the system.

**Chemical compatibility.** Fresh asphalt contains bituminous solvents and oils. PVC membranes and some TPO formulations are incompatible with contact from bituminous materials. EPDM is chemically inert to bituminous compounds — a fundamental advantage in bridge deck applications where asphalt is the overlay of choice.

## Portuguese Bridge Infrastructure Context

Portugal's road network includes a substantial inventory of bridges maintained under the management of Infraestruturas de Portugal (IP), the state road and rail authority. The IP network includes approximately 12,000 road structures (bridges, viaducts, overpasses, culverts), many of which were constructed in the expansion period of 1970–2000 when the motorway network (SCUT corridors and the A-road network) was built with EU funding. This generation of bridges is now 25–50 years old and is entering the intensive maintenance and rehabilitation phase of its lifecycle.

The primary waterproofing system used on Portuguese motorway bridges during the 1980s and 1990s was torch-applied SBS bitumen sheet, typically 4–5 mm thick, applied directly to the concrete deck. This system, where it survives in original condition, is now 25–40 years old. Research conducted by LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) and by road engineering departments at the University of Porto has documented progressive delamination, cracking, and chloride penetration in bridges where original waterproofing has reached or exceeded its design life without rehabilitation.

Rehabilitation demand is therefore substantial. IP's own asset management data (Plano de Manutenção de Pontes) identifies waterproofing replacement as one of the three highest-priority intervention categories across the national bridge stock.

Municipal road networks (managed by individual câmaras municipais) contain thousands of additional smaller bridges — typically spanning rivers, ravines, and railway lines — for which maintenance budgets are significantly constrained and interventions must be planned to minimise traffic disruption.

## Competing Systems

**Spray-applied polyurethane (PU) liquid membranes** have gained market share in Portuguese bridge rehabilitation due to their ability to be applied without traffic interruption to the full deck area. However, their long-term performance under dynamic loading is inferior to EPDM sheet: PU membranes are susceptible to fatigue micro-cracking under cyclical strain, require surface recoating every 10–15 years, and their bond to the substrate is highly sensitive to surface moisture and temperature during application.

**SBS bitumen sheet (torched or cold-applied)** remains the most widely specified system for bridge deck waterproofing in Portugal, primarily due to specifier familiarity and contractor availability. Its principal weaknesses are the open-flame installation method (unacceptable on certain existing structures), reduced flexibility below approximately -10°C, and service life limited to 15–25 years in typical exposure.

**APP bitumen sheet** is harder and less flexible than SBS, making it poorly suited to bridge deck applications where movement accommodation is essential. It is rarely specified for bridges and then only in Mediterranean climates where low-temperature performance is less critical.

**Epoxy resin systems** are used for thin-film deck protection (not waterproofing) and for anti-carbonation treatments on exposed concrete elements. They are not waterproofing membranes in the bridge deck sense and are out of scope here.

## Environmental Considerations

Bridge waterproofing in Portugal regularly involves work over rivers, estuaries, and ecologically sensitive water bodies. The use of open-flame (torch) application methods presents fire and vapour emission risks that are increasingly subject to environmental permit conditions. EPDM cold-installation methodology — using adhesives that comply with current VOC regulation limits (EU Directive 2004/42/EC) — is a material advantage in environmentally constrained sites. EPDM itself is chemically inert in the installed state and presents no leaching risk to watercourses, an important consideration under the European Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) and its Portuguese transposition.
