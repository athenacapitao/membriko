# Bridges — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Bridge deck waterproofing sits at the intersection of civil infrastructure engineering and specialist membrane application. The audience is different from building waterproofing: it includes civil engineers, bridge managers at Infraestruturas de Portugal and câmaras municipais, structural consultants, and public procurement officers — all of whom require technical precision, regulatory alignment, and evidence of contractor competence before shortlisting. This page must speak the language of infrastructure engineering, not residential or commercial building, while remaining accessible enough for building owners managing private bridges and viaducts on industrial or agricultural estates.

The page's authority argument rests on three pillars:
1. Movement accommodation — EPDM's elongation capacity is uniquely matched to bridge deck kinematics
2. Durability under concealment — the membrane cannot be inspected once asphalt is laid; longevity is non-negotiable
3. Portuguese infrastructure context — IP regulations, LNEC references, and the rehabilitation backlog give Membriko a credible local positioning

The persuasion arc follows the same logic as all Membriko application pages: establish the stakes, demonstrate understanding of the engineering problem, present the material science case, prove it with data, show the process, compare alternatives, address compliance, and convert.

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Establish the stakes — bridge waterproofing failure has structural consequences, not just inconvenience.

**Content:**
- Headline: "Impermeabilização de Pontes: o Que Está Abaixo do Asfalto Define a Vida da Estrutura"
- Sub-headline: One sentence on EPDM as the membrane that withstands dynamic loading, chemical aggression, and 50+ years of service beneath asphalt overlay
- Four stat blocks: 50+ years service life / 300–400% elongation / -45°C to +150°C / 20-year Membriko warranty
- CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico Técnico" (primary) + "Ver Especificações" anchor link (secondary)
- Background: Aerial photograph of a Portuguese bridge or viaduct under rehabilitation

**Design note:** Stat blocks emphasise elongation and temperature range — the two most relevant differentiators for civil engineers evaluating this application.

---

## Section 2: Introduction — The Portuguese Bridge Network

**Purpose:** Establish local context and the rehabilitation challenge. Signals expertise in Portuguese infrastructure, not generic European guidance.

**Content:**
- Portugal's bridge stock overview: ~12,000 structures managed by Infraestruturas de Portugal
- The 1970–2000 construction cohort now reaching end of original waterproofing design life
- SBS bitumen sheets of that era now 25–45 years old: chloride penetration, delamination, corrosion
- Municipal bridges: thousands of smaller structures under câmara management, constrained budgets
- Membriko's civil engineering positioning: working with IP-compliant specifications and LNEC-referenced systems

---

## Section 3: Why EPDM for Bridge Deck Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Make the material science case specific to bridge demands. This is the most technically differentiated section on the page.

**Content:**
- The four bridge deck movement mechanisms: thermal expansion, live load deflection, differential settlement at abutments, vibration fatigue
- How EPDM's 300–400% elongation handles each of these
- Chemical compatibility with asphalt overlay (EPDM is inert to bituminous compounds; PVC and TPO are not)
- Temperature stability: asphalt application at 140–180°C, EPDM's 150°C upper service limit and how system design manages this
- No plasticisers: EPDM retains mechanical properties over 50+ years beneath asphalt where temperature is elevated
- Physical properties table: thickness / tensile strength / elongation / cold-fold / water vapour transmission

---

## Section 4: Bridge Types — Application by Structure

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko understands bridge engineering diversity and has the right approach for each type.

**Content:** Three cards or panels.

1. **Tabuleiro em Betão Armado / Pré-esforçado (Concrete Deck — RC and Prestressed)**
   - Most common type on Portuguese motorway and national road network
   - Key demands: chloride barrier, thermal movement accommodation, asphalt compatibility
   - Membriko approach: fully adhered EPDM with reactive primer on prepared concrete surface

2. **Ponte Metálica / Tabuleiro em Aço (Steel Deck)**
   - Used on rail bridges, footbridges, and long-span road bridges
   - Key demands: steel corrosion protection, very high thermal movement (steel coefficient of thermal expansion 3× that of concrete)
   - Membriko approach: mechanically fastened or cold-adhered EPDM over anti-corrosion primer; seam details at expansion joints

3. **Ponte em Arco ou Alvenaria (Masonry Arch and Historic Bridges)**
   - Significant inventory in Portugal's historic road network (stone arch bridges on municipal networks)
   - Key demands: compatibility with masonry substrate, preservation of original character, very uneven surfaces
   - Membriko approach: flexible cold-adhered EPDM that conforms to irregular surfaces; no torch application preserving historic fabric

---

## Section 5: Deck Movement and EPDM Flexibility

**Purpose:** Detailed technical section on the kinematics of bridge movement and how EPDM responds. The deepest technical differentiator on the page.

**Content:**
- Thermal expansion calculation example: 50 m concrete span, 60°C seasonal ΔT, ≈30 mm longitudinal movement
- Live load deflection: L/300 serviceability limit, typical 10–15 mm at midspan for HGV loading
- EPDM elongation capacity vs. required strain: illustrative calculation showing EPDM is 5–10× over-specified for typical deck movements
- Fatigue resistance: thermoset rubber network vs. liquid membranes under cyclical loading
- Expansion joint detail: wide-strip EPDM reinforcement and full-bond flashing at deck-abutment interface
- Comparison of stiffness modulus at -10°C for EPDM vs. SBS bitumen (EPDM retains flexibility; SBS approaches brittle transition)

---

## Section 6: Installation Process — Bridge-Specific Considerations

**Purpose:** Demonstrate site management competence. Bridge installation has traffic management, access, and safety constraints that standard roofing does not.

**Content:** Numbered steps with bridge-specific commentary.

1. **Levantamento e Diagnóstico Estrutural** — Core sample extraction, chloride profiling, carbonation depth, condition mapping of existing waterproofing
2. **Coordenação de Trânsito e Segurança** — Traffic management plan (PTM, Plano de Trabalhos em Segurança), lane closures, working at height over live traffic or waterways
3. **Remoção da Membrana Existente** — Cold milling or manual removal of existing asphalt and membrane; waste disposal and recycling
4. **Preparação do Suporte** — Concrete repair (EN 1504 compliant), crack injection where structural cracks exceed 0.3 mm, grit-blasting or grinding to profile, primer application
5. **Instalação da Membrana EPDM** — Cold-adhesive application of EPDM sheet, seam fabrication, singular point details at drains, expansion joints, kerb upstands, and bearing zones
6. **Ensaio de Estanquidade** — Electronic leak detection over the full deck area before asphalt overlay
7. **Aplicação do Tack Coat e Asfalto** — Coordination with asphalt contractor for tack coat application and hot-mix laying; temperature monitoring during overlay

---

## Section 7: Drainage Integration

**Purpose:** Drainage is a critical element of bridge waterproofing that is often responsible for localised failures. This section addresses it specifically.

**Content:**
- Bridge deck drainage requirements: transverse slope ≥ 2% to kerb outlets; longitudinal gradient as per road design
- Drainage outlet details: EPDM collar flashing around each outlet; no exposed sealant at membrane-outlet interface
- Scupper details at kerb level: EPDM upstand behind kerb; positive drainage away from abutment zone
- Anti-ponding design: identifying low points, specifying additional outlets if as-built slope is insufficient
- Chloride-laden drainage water: EPDM's chemical resistance to road salt concentrations

## Section 8: EPDM vs Competing Systems for Bridge Decks

**Purpose:** Objective comparison that handles the "but the specification says SBS bitumen" objection that is common in Portuguese bridge procurement.

**Content:** Comparison table with 6 rows.

| Feature | EPDM | SBS Bitumen Sheet | Spray PU Liquid | Epoxy Resin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proven bridge service life | 50+ years | 15–25 years | 10–15 years | Not waterproofing |
| Elongation capacity | 300–400% | 30–50% | 200–300% | < 5% |
| Low-temperature flexibility | -45°C | -10°C (SBS) | Variable | Brittle below 5°C |
| Asphalt compatibility | Full | Full | Variable | Not applicable |
| Installation method | Cold — no flame | Torch or cold | Spray — solvent | Roller/squeegee |
| Fatigue resistance under traffic | Excellent | Moderate | Limited | Poor |

Short paragraph: acknowledge SBS bitumen as a proven system for lighter-duty applications; explain why bridge dynamics favour EPDM's superior elongation and fatigue resistance.

## Section 9: Durability Under Asphalt — Long-Term Performance

**Purpose:** Address the invisible-once-installed concern. If the membrane cannot be inspected, the decision must be based on material longevity data.

**Content:**
- ERA 30-year field study data applied to bridge context: membranes retaining 180–240% elongation after 30 years demonstrate structural reserves well above bridge deck strain demands
- Thermal ageing beneath asphalt: EPDM's lack of plasticisers means no progressive embrittlement; asphalt overlay acts as additional UV shield, further extending membrane life
- Chloride impermeability: zero penetration through intact EPDM; the barrier function that prevents the most costly form of bridge deterioration
- Expected service life before rehabilitation: 50+ years with correct installation vs. 15–20 years for SBS bitumen

## Section 11: Maintenance Under Traffic

**Purpose:** Address the lifecycle maintenance question. Engineers and asset managers need to know what happens over the structure's life.

**Content:**
- EPDM's sealed-under-asphalt installation means the membrane itself requires no maintenance during its design life
- Bridge inspection protocol: visual inspection of deck surfacing for signs of delamination (bubbling, rutting at waterproofing level), drainage outlet blockages, joint performance
- Repair methodology if localised damage is detected: partial asphalt removal, EPDM patch repair without full membrane replacement
- Infraestruturas de Portugal inspection cycles: biennial principal inspection, five-yearly detailed inspection per REBAP and IP bridge management manual
- Membriko's post-installation documentation: as-built record, drain locations, seam layout, expansion joint detail drawings — provided to bridge manager for asset file

---

## Section 12: Portuguese Bridge Regulations

**Purpose:** Regulatory assurance for IP and municipal specifiers. Compliance is non-negotiable for public procurement.

**Content:**

## Section 13: Rehabilitation of Historic Bridges

**Purpose:** A distinct audience segment — heritage conservation engineers and municipal authorities responsible for classified bridges. No other EPDM contractor in Portugal addresses this explicitly.

**Content:**
- Portugal's inventory of classified stone arch bridges (Ponte de Lima, medieval bridges on EN roads)
- Waterproofing challenges specific to masonry: irregular substrate, sensitivity to moisture, prohibition of open-flame application near historic fabric
- EPDM's cold-application advantage: no torch, no heat, no risk to historic stonework
- Compatibility with lime mortar and natural stone: EPDM adhesives are solvent-free or water-based variants on heritage applications
- IGESPAR / DGPC (Direção-Geral do Património Cultural) coordination: Membriko works within the heritage consent process for classified structures
- Case: cold-applied EPDM membrane over a rubble-fill spandrel of a stone arch bridge, with drainage redirected to original scupper positions

---

## Section 14: Environmental Compliance

**Purpose:** Environmental permit requirements and Membriko's approach to ecologically sensitive bridge sites.

**Content:**
- Works over rivers and estuaries: APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) and ARH (Administração Regional Hidrográfica) permits
- EPDM cold-application: no solvent emissions, no flame, no bituminous fumes — environmental permit advantages over torch-applied systems
- Waste management: old asphalt recycled through licensed contractor; old bitumen membrane disposed per DL 73/2011 (waste management framework)
- EPDM inertness in contact with water: no plasticiser or additive migration to watercourses; compliant with WFD requirements
- Membriko's site environmental plan for bridge works: spill containment, ecological buffer zones, works scheduling relative to fish migration periods

## Section 14 (continued): 8 FAQs

**Purpose:** Capture search intent from engineers and procurement officers; reduce technical pre-sale queries.

Eight questions:

1. **O EPDM aguenta a temperatura do asfalto aplicado a quente?**
   EPDM's upper continuous service temperature is approximately 150°C, which is at the lower bound of hot-mix asphalt application temperatures (typically 140–180°C). For bridge deck applications, the system design includes a heat-stable bonding layer or reactive primer between the EPDM and the asphalt tack coat, which absorbs thermal energy and protects the membrane during surfacing. Membriko specifies the complete system — membrane plus primer plus tack coat — tested and validated for compatibility with hot-mix asphalt overlay. Short-duration exposure at paving temperatures is within EPDM's tolerance when correctly designed.

2. **É possível aplicar membrana EPDM sem interromper o trânsito?**
   For bridges with two or more lanes, phased installation with lane closures is standard practice. The work sequence — removal, surface preparation, membrane installation, leak test, tack coat — can be organised in lane-width strips over successive traffic management windows. On single-lane bridges (common on municipal networks), temporary road closure with signed diversions is required; Membriko coordinates with the relevant road authority (IP or câmara) for traffic management permits.

3. **Qual a diferença entre EPDM e betume SBS para pontes?**
   SBS bitumen sheet is the historically standard system for Portuguese bridge deck waterproofing. It performs adequately for moderate-span bridges with limited thermal movement and has a service life of 15–25 years. EPDM's advantages for bridges are its higher elongation capacity (300–400% vs. 30–50% for SBS), better low-temperature flexibility (effective to -45°C vs. approximately -10°C for SBS), and significantly longer design service life. For bridges with high movement demands — long spans, steel decks, or seismically active zones — EPDM is the technically superior choice.

4. **A membrana EPDM resiste ao sal das estradas no inverno?**
   Yes. EPDM is chemically inert to sodium chloride (road salt) and the dilute brine concentrations found in road drainage. The membrane does not absorb, react with, or degrade in the presence of road salt. This is one of the primary functions of bridge deck waterproofing: preventing chloride-laden drainage from reaching the reinforced concrete deck and initiating rebar corrosion.

5. **Que espessura de membrana EPDM se especifica para pontes?**
   For bridge deck waterproofing, Membriko specifies a minimum thickness of 1.5 mm EPDM. For high-movement structures (steel decks, long concrete spans, structures in seismically active zones) or where the asphalt overlay will be laid in multiple courses, 2.0 mm is the preferred specification. Thickness selection is documented in the project specification and forms part of the as-built record submitted to the bridge manager.

6. **Como se testa a estanquidade antes da aplicação do asfalto?**
   Electronic leak detection (ELD) is the standard post-installation test for bridge deck EPDM membranes. A high-voltage or low-voltage ELD system is swept over the membrane surface; any pinhole, unsealed seam, or penetration defect creates a detectable electrical discharge. Membriko carries out ELD testing over 100% of the membrane area before authorising asphalt overlay. The test result is documented and submitted to the client as part of the quality assurance record.

7. **O EPDM é aprovado para pontes nas especificações da Infraestruturas de Portugal?**
   EPDM sheet membrane, when supplied with CE marking per EN 13956 and tested to EN 14695 methodology, is technically compliant with the material performance requirements of IP bridge waterproofing specifications. For specific IP procurement contracts, Membriko prepares the technical submission demonstrating EN 13956 Type 3 compliance, product test certificates, and installation method statements aligned with IP ET specifications. Where a project specification references LNEC E 378, Membriko demonstrates equivalent or superior performance against the referenced test methods.

8. **Quanto tempo dura a reabilitação da impermeabilização de uma ponte típica?**
   Duration depends on bridge deck area, access constraints, and traffic management requirements. For a typical municipal bridge (deck area 200–500 m²), with a single lane closure scheme, the waterproofing cycle (removal, prep, membrane, test) typically takes 3–7 working days, with asphalt overlay as a separate subsequent operation. Large motorway viaducts are planned in stages coordinated with IP's maintenance programming calendar. Membriko provides a detailed programme with every quotation, including the traffic management schedule.
