# Foundation Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Foundations and the Hidden Cost of Water

Foundation waterproofing is the single construction decision with the greatest long-term
consequence on a building — and, simultaneously, the one that receives the least attention.
When a roof begins to leak, the problem is immediately visible: a water stain on the ceiling,
a damp patch spreading down the wall. When a foundation admits water, the process is silent.
It begins as a wall that feels damp in January. It progresses to white efflorescence streaking
down the concrete. It develops into cracks in the floor slab, into parquet boards lifting from
the ground floor, into a basement rendered uninhabitable by mould. By the time the full picture
is apparent, remediation costs are frequently five to ten times what a correctly specified and
installed waterproofing system would have cost at the outset.

Membriko, based in Pombal in central Portugal, works with EPDM membrane for foundation
waterproofing because it is the only system with the technical capability to address every
condition a foundation membrane faces: sustained hydrostatic pressure, the aggressive soil
chemistry of Portuguese ground conditions, root penetration, and the structural movements that
concrete inevitably undergoes over the life of a building. This is not a 20-year solution —
it is a solution for the entire service life of the structure, backed by a 20-year Membriko
installation warranty and a documented membrane service life of 50 years or more.

This article presents the technical case for EPDM in foundation waterproofing with the same
directness that Membriko uses in consultations with engineers, architects and project developers:
with data, with standards references, and with the specific knowledge of central Portuguese soil
and groundwater conditions that can only come from sustained site experience in this territory.

## Why EPDM is the Right Solution for Foundation Waterproofing

A foundation waterproofing membrane faces three conditions that no other application presents
simultaneously: permanent burial with no possibility of inspection or replacement, sustained
hydrostatic pressure acting on the underside of the floor slab and inward on the walls, and
continuous contact with aggressive soil chemistry. Each of these conditions eliminates at least
one alternative material. EPDM addresses all three.

### The Chemistry That Makes the Difference

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a rubber elastomer whose primary polymer chain
consists exclusively of single carbon-to-carbon and carbon-to-hydrogen bonds. This saturated
chain is chemically inert to:

- **Alkaline environments (pH up to 14):** fresh concrete has a pH of 12-13 at the interface
  with the membrane. Limestone and calcareous soils — which are prevalent across central Portugal,
  including the Pombal and Leiria area — produce alkaline groundwater at pH 8-11. Bituminous SBS
  membranes are susceptible to alkaline saponification in these environments: the ester linkages
  in the polymer-modified bitumen binder react with alkaline hydroxides, progressively degrading
  the binder. EPDM contains no ester linkages. It is chemically stable at pH up to 14.

- **Organic and humic acids:** the acidic podzolic soils of the Pinhal de Leiria — the world's
  largest planted forest, which covers much of the working territory around Membriko's base —
  have pH values of 4-5 and high concentrations of humic acids produced by decomposing pine
  needle litter. These organic acids progressively attack the bituminous binder in SBS and APP
  membranes. EPDM is completely inert to organic and humic acids.

- **Sulphates and chlorides:** the clay soils of the Alentejo and certain coastal zones carry
  elevated sulphate concentrations. Coastal aquifers experience saltwater intrusion. EPDM is
  fully resistant to saline solutions at any concentration up to and including seawater (35 g/L).

This intrinsic chemical resistance does not depend on surface coatings or protective additives
that deplete over time — it is a permanent property of the vulcanised elastomer's molecular
architecture.

### Capacity to Accommodate Structural Movement

A concrete foundation is not static. In the first 5 to 10 years of a building's life, concrete
undergoes curing shrinkage (volumetric reduction as the concrete dries), differential settlement
(small rotations and displacements between structural elements), and thermal cycling in the
shallow vadose zone. The inevitable result is cracks of 1 to 15 mm width in the concrete
structure. A rigid membrane — bituminous or cementitious — cracks with the concrete. Watertightness
is lost precisely at the point where the structural problem occurs.

EPDM has an elongation at break of ≥ 300% and is fully elastic throughout its deformation range.
In practical terms, this means that a 15 mm crack in the concrete substrate can be bridged by
the EPDM membrane without any compromise of watertightness — the membrane stretches, absorbs
the movement and remains continuous. Membriko designs the installation with dimensional slack
at angles and construction joints so that the membrane always has sufficient material to
accommodate anticipated movements without being placed in tension.

### Root Resistance

Foundations are a preferred destination for tree roots: the interface between membrane and
soil retains moisture, and roots follow moisture gradients. Bituminous membranes are known
to be susceptible to root penetration in buried applications — it is a documented failure mode,
particularly in contexts with pine, eucalyptus and oak trees.

The EPDM used by Membriko is the same reference material for root-barrier membranes in extensive
green roofs, tested and certified to FLL and EN 13948 test methods. This root resistance applies
equally to tree roots in the context of building foundations. In sites with arboreal vegetation
nearby — common in rural Portugal — this characteristic distinguishes EPDM from all alternative
materials.

## Foundation Types — Strip Foundations, Rafts, Pile Caps and Basement Walls

### Strip Foundations

Strip foundations are the most common foundation type in Portuguese residential construction.
A continuous reinforced concrete element runs beneath the load-bearing walls, distributing
building loads into the ground over a strip typically 300 to 600 mm wide and 300 to 500 mm
deep.

When a strip foundation sits at or below the water table — a frequent condition in the alluvial
zones of central Portugal, including the valleys of the Lis and its tributaries, which fall
within Membriko's regular working territory — it requires membrane waterproofing on its base
and side faces. The critical detail is the junction between the strip foundation and the ground
floor slab, where differential movement between two separately poured concrete elements creates
the opening through which water enters.

Membriko waterproofs the strip foundation with 1.0 to 1.5 mm EPDM membrane, with a minimum
150 mm upstand on the side faces to connect to the floor slab membrane. The wall-to-floor angle
receives a purpose-formed EPDM cove piece that eliminates any straight-line water path at this
critical junction.

### Raft Foundations

A raft foundation is a continuous reinforced concrete slab covering the entire plan footprint
of the building. It is used where soil bearing capacity is low (to distribute loads over a
larger area) or where a continuous waterproof barrier is required across the full base of the
structure. Raft foundations are the preferred type for low-bearing-capacity soils and for
locations with high water tables, where the raft also acts as a hydrostatic pressure plate
resisting upward groundwater pressure.

For raft foundations, Membriko installs the EPDM membrane on the prepared blinding layer
(lean concrete regularisation layer) before the structural raft is poured. The membrane is
laid across the base, with edges turned up to connect to the wall membrane. After the raft is
poured and cured, the membrane is completely enclosed — protected above by the slab and below
by the blinding layer — and can neither be damaged nor inspected. This is precisely why Membriko
demands maximum installation quality at this stage: there is no second opportunity.

### Pile Caps

Pile caps — the reinforced concrete elements that connect pile heads to the building superstructure
— require waterproofing at the interface between the pile shaft and the cap concrete. The pile
penetrates down into the saturated zone; the pile-to-concrete interface is a preferential
pathway for water to travel upward along the pile into the structure.

Membriko addresses this with purpose-formed EPDM collars moulded to the pile cross-section
(circular, rectangular or H-section), bonded to the pile shaft and seamed to the base membrane
with QuickSeam tape. The solution ensures continuity of the water barrier between the pile and
the cap slab, without relying on mastic sealants or silicone that deteriorate in permanently
wet environments.

### Basement Walls

Full basements — where habitable space is created below ground level — are less common in
Portugal than in northern Europe (the mild climate reduces the demand for below-grade living
space), but they are a growing application in urban renovation, commercial developments and
high-value residential construction. A basement requires external-face waterproofing on the
walls (applied before backfilling) and on the floor slab, with full continuity between the two.

Membriko installs the EPDM membrane on the external face of basement walls before backfilling,
from the floor slab level up to the grade level termination. The critical details are:
- The construction joint between the floor slab and the wall (point of differential movement)
- Pipe and duct penetrations through the wall
- The termination of the membrane at grade level, fixed with a stainless-steel termination bar
- Window and door penetrations in partially buried walls

Each of these details receives a purpose-specific EPDM solution, documented in the project
record and inspected by Membriko before backfilling commences.

## Hydrostatic Pressure and EPDM

Hydrostatic water pressure is the primary mechanical load on a foundation waterproofing
membrane. It acts continuously and permanently — 24 hours a day, 365 days a year — in contrast
to rainfall, which is intermittent, or wind pressure, which is variable. It is the most
unrelenting load a membrane faces, because it never stops.

### Calculating Hydrostatic Pressure

Hydrostatic pressure increases linearly with the height of the water column above the point
of measurement:
- At 1.0 m of water head (water table 1 m above the base of the floor slab): approximately
  10 kPa (0.10 bar)
- At 2.0 m of water head: approximately 20 kPa
- At 3.0 m of water head: approximately 30 kPa

For context, EN 1928 Method B — the watertightness test standard referenced in EN 13967 —
tests membranes at 60 kPa, which corresponds to six times the pressure of a 1 m water head.
The EPDM membranes that Membriko uses for foundation work pass this test without water passage.

### How Sustained Hydrostatic Pressure Fails Alternative Membranes

Bituminous membranes are subject to two failure mechanisms under sustained hydrostatic pressure
that EPDM does not share:

**Creep:** polymer-modified bitumens are viscoelastic materials — they deform slowly under
constant load, particularly at temperatures above 15-20°C. In areas where the membrane is
not fully bonded to the concrete substrate (air pockets beneath the bitumen), hydrostatic
pressure creates progressive blistering that eventually leads to membrane rupture.

**Edge peel:** hydrostatic pressure acts laterally on basement walls, creating a peel force
on the membrane termination. If the bitumen-to-concrete bond is imperfect — a frequent
condition on damp or contaminated concrete surfaces — progressive delamination begins precisely
at the points of highest pressure.

EPDM avoids both mechanisms: its permanent elasticity prevents irreversible deformation under
sustained load, and its solvent- or acrylic-based contact adhesive bond, when correctly applied
to properly prepared concrete, maintains membrane-to-concrete contact without progressive peel.

### Seasonal Water Table Variation

In Portugal, the water table varies significantly between the dry season (May to October) and
the wet season (November to April). In the alluvial zones of central Portugal — the valleys of
the Lis, the Mondego and their tributaries, which fall within much of Membriko's regular working
territory — this seasonal variation can be 2 to 4 metres between the summer minimum and the
winter maximum.

Membriko specifies foundation waterproofing for the design water table (calculated from
historical groundwater level data for the specific location), not for the water table observed
on the day of the site survey. The distinction between the observed level and the design level
is one of the most common errors in Portuguese foundation waterproofing specifications — and
one of the errors with the most serious consequences.

---

## The Installation Process — 8 Steps to Permanent Foundation Protection

Membriko follows a systematic and fully documented installation process that respects the
construction sequence of the project and the specific conditions of each site. There is no
generic process: every project is specified and executed individually.

### Step 1: Technical Site Survey

A foundation survey is different in character from a roof or pool survey. Membriko assesses:

- **Foundation type and depth:** identification of the existing or proposed foundation type,
  depth relative to natural ground level, and relationship to the historical water table for
  the area
- **Soil conditions:** soil texture and composition (granular, clay, calcareous, granitic),
  proximity of arboreal vegetation, indicators of soil moisture
- **Concrete condition:** existing cracking, concrete quality, moisture or efflorescence
  present at the surface, residual form-release agents
- **Singular points:** existing or planned pipe penetrations, service ducts, structural
  elements passing through the foundation plane
- **Local hydrological history:** historical water table data, flooding records, neighbouring
  properties' experience with moisture problems

The technical report from this survey underpins the solution design. Membriko does not submit
proposals without completing this diagnostic stage.

### Step 2: Solution Design

Based on the survey, Membriko produces the waterproofing project specification:

- Membrane thickness (1.0 mm to 2.0 mm, matched to the calculated hydrostatic pressure)
- Adhesion method (contact adhesive, self-adhesive system or fleece-backed membrane for
  irregular or difficult substrates)
- Drainage design: French drain sizing, drainage geocomposite specification, sump pump
  chamber location and capacity where required
- Details of all singular points: every pipe, every construction joint, every internal angle
- Installation sequence plan, coordinated with the main contractor's programme

### Step 3: Substrate Preparation

Substrate preparation is the step that most determines the longevity of the waterproofing
system. Membriko treats this phase with the same rigour as the membrane installation.

- **Cleaning:** removal of laitance, form-release oil, loose concrete, efflorescence and
  organic contaminants by high-pressure water jetting and/or mechanical grinding
- **Crack repair:** active cracks (showing water passage) are injected with hydro-expansive
  polyurethane resin that cures on contact with water and seals the crack even in wet
  conditions. Inactive cracks are filled with epoxy repair mortar.
- **Surface rectification:** sharp edges, exposed reinforcement bar ends, concrete protrusions
  are ground back and removed — any sharp point can, under sustained hydrostatic pressure,
  eventually puncture the membrane
- **Blinding layer:** for raft foundations, the lean concrete regularisation layer must have
  a flatness tolerance of ±5 mm under a 2 m straightedge and no exposed aggregate

### Step 4: Base Membrane Installation

The EPDM membrane is installed first on the base — the floor slab or strip foundation base —
with the panel layout optimised to minimise seam count. Membriko uses the fully adhered method
(full-surface bonding) for foundation work under hydrostatic pressure: full bonding eliminates
the air pockets that, under sustained upward pressure, create blister failure points.

Seams are made with QuickPrime Plus primer and 150 mm QuickSeam tape (EN 13967 specifies a
minimum 100 mm seam width; Membriko uses 150 mm as a standard safety margin). Each seam is
probe-tested after curing.

The base membrane edges are turned up the wall faces by a minimum of 150 mm, ready to be
overlapped by the wall membrane.

### Step 5: Wall Membrane Installation

The wall EPDM membrane is installed from the bottom upward, overlapping the upstand of the
base membrane. The internal angle at the wall-to-floor junction receives a purpose-formed EPDM
cove piece — a 90-degree moulded insert that fills the internal corner and ensures continuous
coverage without stress concentration. This is the most critical single detail in the entire
foundation waterproofing system.

On basement walls, the membrane is carried up to grade level and terminated with a mechanical
termination bar in anodised aluminium or stainless steel, fixed with stainless-steel expansion
anchors. The bar top edge is sealed with polyurethane mastic as a surface seal, but the
mechanical bar is the structural element — the mastic is weather protection only.

### Step 6: Singular Point Details

Every service penetration through the membrane receives a purpose-specific solution. Membriko
uses no mastic sealant as the primary sealing element at any singular point — mastic has a
limited service life of 5 to 15 years in permanently wet conditions and must never be the
primary water barrier at a foundation penetration.

- **Pipes passing perpendicular to the membrane:** purpose-formed EPDM pipe boots bonded to
  the field membrane and to the pipe exterior with QuickSeam tape; mechanical compression ring
  for high hydrostatic pressure applications
- **Construction joints:** the membrane is installed with a deliberate fold (loop) at the
  joint position — a reserve of material that accommodates future structural movement without
  placing the membrane in tension
- **Column bases:** a continuous EPDM collar is seamed around the column base and to the
  floor membrane, eliminating the gap between the column and the waterproof plane

### Step 7: Protection Layer and Drainage System

Before backfilling, the EPDM wall membrane receives a drainage and protection geocomposite:
a prefabricated panel combining a dimpled polyethylene drainage core with a bonded polypropylene
geotextile filter. This geocomposite simultaneously:

- **Protects the membrane:** backfill aggregate creates point loads that, without protection,
  would cause abrasion damage to the EPDM surface over time
- **Drains:** the dimpled core channels groundwater downward by gravity to the perimeter
  French drain, before it can accumulate against the wall membrane
- **Filters:** the geotextile prevents fine soil particles from migrating into and clogging
  the drainage core

The perimeter French drain — rigid perforated PVC pipe, minimum DN150, bedded in 20-40 mm
clean gravel and wrapped in geotextile filter fabric — collects water channelled by the
geocomposite and discharges it to the drainage outlet or sump chamber.

### Step 8: Inspection, Documentation and Warranty

Before backfilling — the point at which no further access to the membrane will be possible —
Membriko carries out a complete visual inspection of the entire waterproofed surface. Every
seam is probe-tested. Every singular point is photographed and documented. The photographic
as-built record is delivered to the client and the project engineer.

Membriko issues the 20-year installation warranty certificate on project completion. This
warranty is supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product warranty and to the statutory
defects liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Art. 1225): 5 years
for general defects and 10 years for structural defects.

## Critical Details — The Points That Determine Success or Failure

In foundation waterproofing, 80 per cent of failures occur at less than 10 per cent of the
waterproofed area: the internal angles, construction joints and pipe penetrations. Membriko
dedicates proportionally more attention to these points than to the continuous field membrane.

### The Wall-to-Floor Junction — The Highest Risk Point

The construction joint between the floor slab and the basement wall is the most common single
failure point in foundation waterproofing. This is where two separately poured concrete elements
— the floor slab, cast first, and the wall, cast later — meet. As the building settles, the
concrete shrinks and thermal loads vary, differential movement between the slab and the wall
opens a gap precisely at this joint.

A rigid membrane — bituminous or cementitious — cracks at this point. An EPDM membrane,
installed with a purpose-formed cove piece at the internal corner and with sufficient material
to accommodate the movement, maintains continuity.

Membriko's execution detail at this point: base membrane turned up the wall face by a minimum
150 mm; 150 mm x 150 mm EPDM cove piece bonded over the internal corner with complete surface
contact; wall membrane lapped down over the cove piece with a minimum 150 mm overlap. The seam
between the cove piece and the field membrane is made with QuickSeam across its full extent.
No part of this detail relies on mastic as the primary sealing element.

### Pipe Penetrations — The Temptation of Simplification

Every pipe that passes through the membrane interrupts the waterproof barrier and requires
a permanent reinstatement of that barrier. The temptation for a general contractor unfamiliar
with specialist waterproofing is to address these points with a collar of silicone sealant
around the pipe — a solution that performs adequately for 5 to 10 years in wet conditions and
then fails progressively.

Membriko solves pipe penetrations with purpose-formed EPDM pipe boots: tubular EPDM pieces
moulded to the pipe diameter, seamed to the field membrane with QuickSeam tape and bonded to
the pipe exterior with contact adhesive. For pipes under high hydrostatic pressure, a mechanical
compression ring is added to ensure the seal is maintained even if the adhesive bond weakens.

### Construction Joints — Predictable Movement, Prepared Protection

Construction joints between floor slabs poured in separate stages, or between different
structural elements, are planes of predictable movement. Membriko installs the EPDM membrane
with a deliberate fold — an additional loop of material — positioned precisely at the construction
joint. This fold functions as a material reserve: when the joint opens due to structural
movement, the membrane does not go into tension — the fold straightens and accommodates the
displacement without compromise of watertightness.

## EPDM vs Bituminous, HDPE and Cementitious Foundation Waterproofing

Membriko presents this comparison with full technical honesty. There are situations where
alternative solutions are appropriate or even preferable. The objective is for clients to make
decisions with accurate data.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Bituminous SBS/APP | HDPE Geomembrane | Cementitious |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | 30-250% | 700% (yield at 15%) | 0-2% |
| Effective crack bridging | Up to 15 mm | Up to 3-5 mm | Up to 3 mm (yield) | None |
| Root resistance | Excellent (EN 13948) | Poor to moderate | Good | N/A |
| Resistance to alkaline pH > 12 | Excellent | Poor (saponification) | Good | Good |
| Resistance to humic acids | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Good |
| Below-grade service life | 50+ years | 20-30 years | 40-50 years | 15-25 years |
| Field seaming method | QuickSeam tape (manual) | Torch / self-adhesive | Extrusion welding | Brush or trowel |
| 30-year cumulative cost index | 100 | 140 | 110 | 160 |

**Membriko acknowledges:** cementitious crystalline systems offer a genuine advantage for
retrofit basement applications where external excavation is not possible — they can be applied
from the interior, on the negative side, against the water pressure. EPDM is primarily a
positive-side application. For cases where external access is genuinely not available, Membriko
assesses the situation honestly and, where appropriate, refers the client to alternative
solutions. We do not recommend EPDM for applications where it is not the optimal solution.

## Drainage Integration — French Drains and Geocomposite Systems

Foundation waterproofing and drainage are complementary systems that must be designed together.
A drainage system that removes groundwater before it can accumulate and build hydrostatic pressure
reduces the load on the membrane; a correctly detailed membrane ensures that any water that
does reach the membrane cannot penetrate the structure. Together, the two systems are more
effective than either alone.

### French Drain Design

The French drain is the standard perimeter drainage element for below-grade construction: a
rigid perforated PVC pipe (minimum DN150 diameter) laid in a gravel bedding layer (20-40 mm
clean aggregate) wrapped in a geotextile filter to prevent fine soil migration. The drain
collects groundwater at foundation level and diverts it to a drainage outfall or sump chamber
before it can accumulate and build pressure against the wall membrane.

Membriko installs the French drain at the toe of the EPDM wall membrane, with the geotextile-
wrapped gravel layer placed against the base membrane. The drainage geocomposite on the wall
above channels any groundwater that penetrates the backfill down to the gravel bedding and
into the perforated pipe.

### Geocomposite Drainage and Protection Boards

For new construction, Membriko installs EPDM in conjunction with prefabricated geocomposite
drainage boards. These panels — a dimpled high-density polyethylene drainage core with a bonded
polypropylene geotextile on the outer face — provide three simultaneous functions when placed
against the EPDM wall membrane before backfilling:

- **Protection:** the board distributes the point loads from angular backfill aggregate, preventing
  abrasion damage to the EPDM surface both during the backfilling operation and in long-term
  service
- **Drainage:** the dimpled core channels groundwater downward by gravity to the French drain
  at the membrane toe, reducing the hydrostatic head that builds against the wall membrane
- **Filtration:** the geotextile prevents fine soil particles from migrating into and clogging
  the drainage core channels

### Sump Pump Systems

Where the drainage outlet elevation is above the groundwater level (a common condition on flat
sites), the water collected by the French drain must be discharged by a submersible pump in a
sump chamber. Membriko designs the sump chamber volume and pump capacity based on the calculated
groundwater inflow rate for the specific site conditions, ensuring that the drainage system can
handle the design storm event without overflow.

## Portuguese Soil Conditions and Water Tables

Membriko works primarily across central Portugal — Pombal, Leiria, Coimbra, Santarém and
the surrounding districts — and has direct site experience with the soil and hydrogeological
conditions of this region. This experience informs every foundation waterproofing specification
that Membriko produces. The following is not generic content about Portuguese soils: it is
operational knowledge.

### The Pombal and Leiria Region

Membriko's regular working territory spans three geologically distinct zones with very different
implications for foundation waterproofing specification:

**Jurassic limestone plateau to the east:** the calcareous plateau of the Serra de Aire and
Pombal has alkaline soils (pH 7.5-8.5), relatively free-draining bedrock and a deep seasonal
water table. However, valley floors and enclosed drainage lines within the karst landscape
maintain permanently high water tables throughout the year. The alkaline environment is the
principal adverse factor for bituminous membranes in this area — and a non-issue for EPDM.

**Alluvial plains of the Lis valley and tributaries:** alluvial soils are fine-grained (silts
and clays), low-permeability and characterised by a permanently high water table — often within
1 metre of the surface throughout the wet season. These are the most demanding conditions for
foundation waterproofing in the region: near-permanent hydrostatic pressure, fine-grained soils
that require carefully specified geotextile filtration, and risk of uplift on lightly loaded
raft foundations in less dense alluvial deposits.

**Pinhal de Leiria forest soils:** podzolic acidic soils (pH 4-5), high organic matter content
and high humic acid concentrations from decomposing pine litter. The water table is variable,
but the soil chemistry is the dominant factor for membrane durability. This is where EPDM's
resistance to organic and humic acids is most relevant — and where bituminous membranes have
documented degradation over periods of 10 to 20 years in the Portuguese research literature.

### Northern Portugal (Minho, Douro Litoral)

High annual rainfall (1,200-2,000 mm/year), granitic basement, acidic soils. Perched water
tables in the vadose zone are common during the winter months. Foundations in this region
regularly encounter groundwater even in locations that appear completely dry in summer. EPDM's
resistance to cyclic wetting and drying — which causes fatigue cracking in less elastic membranes
— is a specific advantage in this climatic regime.

### Alentejo

Low rainfall (500-700 mm/year), deep clay soils, large seasonal water table variation — from
10-15 m depth at the summer minimum to within 1-2 m of the surface at the winter maximum in
the heavier clay areas. The shrink-swell behaviour of expansive Alentejo clays creates
foundation movements that demand the elastic deformation capacity of EPDM. The sulphate content
of Alentejo clay soils is also above the national average, adding a soil-chemistry consideration
to the waterproofing specification.

### Algarve

Low rainfall (400-600 mm/year), but permanently high water tables near rivers and estuaries
(Guadiana, Arade, Gilão), and localised saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. Foundation
waterproofing in the Algarve must address saline groundwater with the same specification approach
as any marine-adjacent application. EPDM's full resistance to saline solutions at seawater
concentration makes it the rational choice for coastal Algarve foundation work.

## Regulations — RGEU, EN 13967 and Eurocode 7

### RGEU — General Building Regulations

The Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas (Decree-Law 38382/51 and subsequent amendments)
governs building construction in Portugal. Articles 95 to 97 establish the obligation to protect
all below-grade structural elements against moisture and water infiltration. The RGEU specifies
the performance outcome — watertight below-grade construction — without prescribing the method
or material. Membriko's EPDM foundation membrane, with a 50-year projected service life and
20-year installation warranty, unambiguously satisfies this performance obligation.

### EN 13967 — Flexible Sheets for Underground Waterproofing

EN 13967 is the European product standard for flexible sheets for waterproofing of underground
structures and below-grade applications. It defines minimum performance requirements for
thickness, tensile strength, elongation at break, watertightness and chemical resistance, and
establishes the CE marking requirements that all compliant products must carry. All EPDM
membranes that Membriko uses for foundation applications carry CE marking issued under EN 13967.

This standard is the reference that should appear in every tender specification and building
licence submission that includes below-grade membrane waterproofing. Membriko provides complete
CE Declaration of Performance documentation for each membrane product used, for inclusion in
licensing and tender submissions.

### Eurocode 7 (NP EN 1997) — Geotechnical Design

Eurocode 7, transposed into Portuguese law as NP EN 1997, is the geotechnical design standard
that classifies groundwater conditions and requires design to be based on the design water
table level — not the observed level on the day of the site investigation. The design water
table is the historically recorded maximum level for the area, accounting for seasonal variation
and return-period flood events. Membriko bases its hydrostatic pressure calculations and
membrane thickness specifications on the design water table per EC7 principles, obtained from
available historical data for each specific project location.

## New Build vs Retrofit Foundation Waterproofing

### New Construction

Foundation waterproofing in new construction is the ideal scenario: full access to all surfaces
before backfilling, the ability to sequence the installation in coordination with the structural
programme, and no pre-existing conditions to contend with. Membriko engages from the design
stage — foundation waterproofing should appear in the building licence documentation, the
employer's requirements and the project budget from the outset, not be treated as a cost item
to minimise at the construction stage when it is often too late to specify correctly.

The typical sequence for new construction: foundation concrete poured and cured; blinding layer
prepared; EPDM membrane installed on the base and walls; all singular point details executed
and inspected; drainage geocomposite and French drain installed; backfilling carried out in
controlled layers with stone-free material placed against the geocomposite.

### Retrofit Waterproofing of Existing Foundations

Retrofit waterproofing — treating existing buildings that have developed moisture problems or
water ingress through the foundations — is technically more complex but is frequently achievable
with external EPDM. The approach requires:

- **Perimeter excavation:** opening a trench around the affected perimeter to the underside of
  the existing foundation, with appropriate shoring where required
- **Structural assessment:** evaluation of existing concrete condition, identification of active
  cracks and structural defects, assessment of any existing waterproofing and its degradation
- **Substrate preparation:** crack injection with hydro-expansive polyurethane resin, surface
  cleaning and rectification, repair of deteriorated concrete zones
- **EPDM membrane installation:** applied to the prepared external surface with all singular
  point details executed to the same standard as new construction
- **Drainage system reinstatement:** replacement or enhancement of existing drainage, installation
  of geocomposite protection board
- **Controlled backfilling:** reinstatement of the excavated material in compacted layers with
  membrane protection

Membriko assesses the feasibility of external retrofit in each case. Where perimeter excavation
is not viable — party walls, adjacent structures, underground services — Membriko advises the
client honestly and, where appropriate, directs them to alternative solutions suited to the
constraints of the situation.

## Common Mistakes in Foundation Waterproofing

Over years of working on foundation waterproofing projects across central Portugal, Membriko
has identified the most frequent errors that lead to early failure. We share this knowledge
openly: these are the errors that Membriko never makes, and that any client should insist their
contractor does not make.

**Applying membrane to wet or contaminated concrete:** the bond fails within months. Concrete
must be clean, dry and free of form-release agents, curing compounds and surface moisture before
any membrane is applied. Membriko carries out surface condition checks before starting any
installation and refuses to begin if conditions are not met.

**Seams executed below minimum width:** EN 13967 requires seam widths of ≥ 100 mm in buried
waterproofing membranes. Seams narrower than this are vulnerable to peel failure under
hydrostatic pressure. Membriko uses 150 mm QuickSeam tape as its standard, providing a safety
margin above the code minimum.

**No protection layer before backfilling:** EPDM is damaged by angular backfill aggregate
during the backfilling operation and by sustained point load contact in service. The geocomposite
protection board is not optional — it is the difference between a 50-year installation and
potential medium-term mechanical damage.

**Skipping the wall-to-floor junction cove detail:** the most common single failure mechanism
in Portuguese foundation waterproofing. General contractors unfamiliar with specialist membrane
installation omit the purpose-formed cove piece and rely on a straight seam at the internal
angle — a detail that cracks under the first differential movement between slab and wall.

**Specifying for the summer observed water table rather than the design water table:** in
the alluvial zones of central Portugal, the difference between the summer minimum and the winter
design maximum can be 2 to 4 metres of hydrostatic head. A specification written from a summer
site visit is potentially dangerously inadequate for winter conditions.

**Using bituminous membrane installers for EPDM installation:** the installation and seaming
technique for EPDM is entirely different from torch-applied or cold-applied bituminous systems.
QuickSeam tape application, primer preparation, probe testing and the specific detailing methods
for EPDM singular points require training in EPDM systems specifically. Membriko's installation
team is trained exclusively in EPDM and is not a bituminous membrane team converted to EPDM.

## Frequently Asked Questions — Foundation Waterproofing with EPDM

**What is the difference between foundation waterproofing and damp-proofing?**

Foundation waterproofing creates a physical barrier against liquid water under hydrostatic
pressure — the water table pressing against the base slab and walls. Damp-proofing treatments
(silicone injections, surface-applied silane/siloxane sealers, damp-proof courses in masonry)
address capillary moisture rise through porous wall materials above the water table. They solve
different problems. For foundations with a water table, a full membrane system is required.
Surface treatments are ineffective against hydrostatic pressure.

**Is it possible to waterproof an existing building's foundations without excavating?**

For an external EPDM membrane, excavation is required in most cases. For existing buildings
where external access is not possible, internal cavity drain systems (studded HDPE sheeting
applied to the interior wall face, creating a managed drainage cavity) or negative-side
cementitious waterproofing may be considered. Membriko assesses each situation honestly and
recommends the appropriate solution for the actual constraints of the project, including when
that solution is not EPDM.

**Does EPDM resist penetration by pine and eucalyptus roots near the foundation?**

Yes. EPDM is the reference material for root-barrier membranes in extensive green roofs, tested
and certified to FLL test methods and EN 13948. The same root resistance applies to tree roots
pursuing the moisture gradient toward a building's foundation. In the context of the Pinhal de
Leiria, where many properties have pine trees with extensive lateral root systems in close
proximity to buildings, this root resistance is a specification requirement, not a secondary
feature. Bituminous foundation membranes do not offer equivalent root resistance.

**What is the correct EPDM membrane thickness for a residential foundation?**

For standard residential foundation waterproofing with the water table more than 1 metre below
the underside of the floor slab, Membriko specifies 1.0 to 1.5 mm. For basements and foundations
with a water table within 1 metre of the slab underside, or in particularly aggressive soil
chemical environments, the specification is 1.5 to 2.0 mm. The thickness is always determined
after the site survey and hydrogeological assessment — Membriko does not apply a generic
thickness to foundation work.

**Does the EPDM membrane resist the alkaline concrete environment and the acid soils of the pine forest?**

Yes to both. EPDM is chemically stable in alkaline environments up to pH 14 — including the
strongly alkaline environment at the concrete surface, where the pH can reach 12-13 during
the early years of concrete hydration and curing. In the acidic soils of the Pinhal de Leiria,
EPDM is equally inert to the organic and humic acids that are known to progressively degrade
bituminous membranes. This dual resistance to both extremes of pH is a specific property of
EPDM's saturated polymer backbone.

**How does Membriko integrate drainage with the foundation waterproofing?**

Membriko designs and installs the complete below-grade protection system: EPDM membrane,
drainage and protection geocomposite board placed against the wall membrane before backfilling,
perimeter French drain in perforated rigid PVC pipe with gravel bedding and geotextile filter,
and sump pump chamber where gravity drainage is not possible. The drainage and waterproofing
systems are designed as an integrated unit from the outset — not specified separately and
then combined on site with coordination problems.

**What warranty does Membriko provide for foundation waterproofing?**

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty on all foundation waterproofing work carried
out with EPDM membrane. This warranty is supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product
warranty and to the statutory defects liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código
Civil, Art. 1225) — 5 years for general construction defects and 10 years for structural
defects. The warranty certificate is issued to the client on project completion and is
transferable to subsequent owners of the property.

**Is EPDM for foundations the same product as EPDM for roofing?**

The base polymer chemistry is the same, but foundation-grade EPDM is supplied in formats
specifically developed for below-grade application: self-adhesive backing systems for bonding
to difficult or damp substrates, fleece-backed versions providing mechanical protection against
aggregate contact, and CE marking under EN 13967 (the underground waterproofing standard)
rather than EN 13956 (the roofing standard). The physical performance requirements in EN 13967
are specifically calibrated for the hydrostatic pressure, chemical exposure and service
conditions of below-grade construction. Membriko specifies only EN 13967-compliant membranes
for all foundation and below-grade waterproofing applications.
