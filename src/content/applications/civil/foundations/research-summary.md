# Foundations — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Foundation Waterproofing: Core Chemistry and Relevance

Foundation waterproofing is one of the most technically demanding applications for any membrane
material. Unlike roofing or pool lining, foundation membranes must perform in permanent contact
with soil, in complete darkness, under hydrostatic pressure, often in aggressive soil-water
chemistry environments — and must do so for the entire service life of the structure, which
in residential and civil construction is typically 50-100 years. There is no realistic possibility
of membrane replacement once a structure is built and backfilled.

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is ideally suited to below-grade waterproofing because
its resistance mechanisms are intrinsic to its polymer chemistry, not dependent on coatings,
surface treatments or sacrificial components that deplete over time. The saturated EPDM polymer
backbone is resistant to:

- Hydrostatic water pressure (EN 1928 Method B: watertight at pressures far exceeding those
  encountered at typical residential foundation depths)
- Soil-contact chemical degradation: alkaline groundwater (pH up to 12), organic acids from
  decomposing organic matter (pH as low as 4), sulphates, chlorides, humic acids
- Root penetration from tree roots, shrub roots and herbaceous root systems
- Microbiological attack: EPDM is not a nutrient substrate for fungi, bacteria or algae
- Mechanical stress from soil settlement, thermal cycling in the shallow vadose zone, and
  differential movement at construction joints

The physical properties of foundation-grade EPDM are identical to those of other application-grade
EPDM — the same base material is used throughout. The key differences in foundation specification
lie in membrane thickness (typically 1.0-1.5 mm for waterproof membrane under drainage layer;
up to 2.0 mm for high hydrostatic pressure applications or aggressive chemical environments),
the use of self-adhesive or pre-bonded fleece backing systems for adhered below-grade installations,
and the detailing methodology at construction joints, wall-to-floor junctions and pipe penetrations.

## Hydrostatic Pressure and EPDM Performance

Hydrostatic water pressure is the primary mechanical load on a foundation membrane. The pressure
increases linearly with water depth: at a water table depth of 1.0 m below the base of the
foundation slab, the hydrostatic pressure at the base of the membrane is approximately 10 kPa
(0.10 bar). At 3.0 m of head, it is approximately 30 kPa. These values are well within the
watertight performance of EPDM membranes tested per EN 1928 Method B (pressure testing to
60 kPa and above without passage of water).

In below-grade applications, hydrostatic pressure acts in two critical directions:
1. Upward pressure on the base slab membrane (positive side pressure): the membrane is pressed
   against the concrete, and the concrete provides the mechanical resistance — the membrane
   needs to bridge any cracks that develop in the concrete slab
2. Inward lateral pressure on basement wall membranes: the membrane must maintain contact
   with the wall substrate and resist peeling under the combined effect of hydrostatic pressure
   and wall-to-membrane adhesive bond

EPDM handles both scenarios well because:
- Its elongation at break (≥ 300-400%) allows it to bridge concrete cracks of several millimetres
  width without rupture — a critical capability as concrete structures inevitably develop
  shrinkage and settlement cracks in the first years after construction
- Its tensile strength (≥ 9 N/mm²) provides resistance to point loads and the pressure-driven
  deformation at unbonded zones
- Its dimensional stability under sustained load (creep resistance) is substantially superior
  to bituminous membranes, which flow under sustained hydrostatic pressure at elevated temperatures

The performance of EPDM under sustained hydrostatic pressure has been validated in long-term
studies by the European Rubber Research Institute (ERA) and the German SKZ institute, with
service life projections exceeding 50 years under continuous immersion conditions equivalent
to below-grade water table exposure.

## Below-Grade Chemical Environment

Portuguese soils present a wide range of chemistries that affect membrane durability:

### Alkaline Groundwater (pH 8-11)

Limestone and calcareous soils — common in the Estremadura region, around Pombal and Leiria,
and in the Algarve — produce alkaline groundwater as carbonate dissolves. pH values of 8-10
are typical. At extreme concentrations, calcium hydroxide (portlandite) leaching from concrete
can raise local pH to 11-12 at the concrete-membrane interface.

Bituminous membranes are susceptible to saponification in strongly alkaline environments:
the ester groups in polymer-modified bitumen react with alkaline hydroxides to form soaps that
degrade the membrane binder. EPDM has no ester groups in its backbone and is unaffected by
pH up to 14 (sodium hydroxide immersion tests show no degradation).

### Acidic Soils (pH 4-6)

The granitic soils of northern Portugal (Trás-os-Montes, Minho, Beira Alta) and the podzolic
soils of pine forest areas (significant in the Leiria region around the Pinhal de Leiria) are
acidic, with pH values typically 4-6 and high humic acid content. Humic acids — organic acids
produced by the decomposition of plant material — are known degradants of bituminous membranes,
attacking aromatic compounds in the bitumen binder over time.

EPDM is unaffected by humic acids and by the organic acid environment of acidic forest soils.
This is of direct relevance to foundation work in the Pombal/Leiria region, where many
properties border or are within the Pinhal de Leiria — the world's largest planted forest.

### Sulphate-Rich Soils

Sulphate-bearing soils (sulphate classes DS-2 to DS-4 per EN 206) are present in clay-rich
zones across Portugal, particularly in the Alentejo clay plains and in coastal areas with
evaporitic deposits. Sulphates attack concrete (sulphate attack, gypsum formation, ettringite
expansion) but do not directly degrade EPDM. In sulphate-rich environments, the membrane serves
the additional function of protecting the concrete structure from sulphate ingress — providing
the structural benefit of chemical barrier protection in addition to waterproofing.

### Saline Groundwater

Coastal foundations and some inland areas with connate saline groundwater expose membranes to
chloride-rich water. EPDM is fully resistant to sodium chloride solutions at any concentration
up to and including seawater (approximately 35 g/L NaCl). This resistance is the same
mechanism that makes EPDM suitable for marine industrial applications (offshore dock fenders,
harbour structures, tidal barriers).

## Portuguese Water Table Conditions

Portugal's water table conditions vary significantly by region and are of direct relevance
to foundation waterproofing specification:

**Northern Portugal (Minho, Douro Litoral):** High annual rainfall (1,200-2,000 mm/year),
granitic basement, shallow impermeable horizons. Perched water tables in the vadose zone are
common in winter months. Foundations in this region frequently encounter groundwater even
in apparently dry locations during the November-March period. EPDM's resistance to intermittent
wetting and drying (which causes freeze-thaw and shrinkage cycling in less flexible membranes)
is an advantage in this regime.

**Central Portugal (Beira Litoral, Estremadura — including the Pombal/Leiria area):** Mixed
regime with moderate rainfall (700-1,200 mm/year), limestone karst in places, alluvial plains
along the Mondego, Lis and Nabão rivers with permanently high water tables. The Pombal area
sits at the interface of calcareous Jurassic formations and alluvial zones — foundation depths
of 1.0-2.5 m frequently encounter the permanent water table in the alluvial zones. This is
Membriko's home territory, and the team has direct site experience with these soil and water
table conditions.

**Alentejo:** Low rainfall (500-700 mm/year), deep clay soils, seasonal variation in water
table is large. Summer water tables may drop 10-15 m; winter recharge can raise them to within
1-2 m of the surface in clay-heavy areas. Foundations for larger structures (warehouses,
agricultural buildings, rural hotels) require full membrane systems capable of handling
seasonal hydrostatic pressure cycles.

**Algarve:** Low rainfall (400-600 mm/year) but high groundwater demand from agriculture
and tourism. Coastal aquifer exploitation has lowered water tables in some areas; in others,
near rivers and estuaries (Guadiana, Arade), permanently high water tables at or near
foundation level are the norm. Salt water intrusion into coastal aquifers adds the saline
groundwater exposure described above.

## Foundation Types and Membrane Relevance

### Strip Foundations (Sapatas Contínuas)

The most common foundation type for residential construction in Portugal. A continuous reinforced
concrete strip under load-bearing walls, typically 300-600 mm wide and 300-500 mm deep. Strip
foundations that encounter the water table require membrane waterproofing on all below-grade
surfaces: base, sides, and the connection to the ground floor slab. The critical detail is
the junction between the strip foundation and the ground floor slab, where differential
settlement movement must be accommodated.

### Raft Foundations (Lajes de Fundação)

A reinforced concrete slab covering the entire footprint of the building, used where soil
bearing capacity is low or where a continuous waterproof barrier is required across the full
base area. Raft foundations are particularly common in expansive clay soils (Alentejo) and
in areas with high water tables where the raft also serves as a hydrostatic pressure plate.
EPDM is applied under the raft (on the blinding layer) before concrete is cast — this is
the classic "tanking" approach where the membrane is fully enclosed and protected by the
structure above and the prepared substrate below.

### Pile Caps (Maciços de Encabeçamento)

Pile caps — the reinforced concrete caps that connect pile heads to the superstructure —
require waterproofing at the junction between the pile head and the cap, where water can
travel vertically along the pile shaft from the saturated zone into the structure. EPDM
detailing around pile heads is a specialist application requiring pre-formed collars and
careful adhesion to the pile concrete.

### Basement Walls (Paredes de Cave)

Full basement construction is less common in Portugal than in northern European countries
(warm climate reduces the need for below-grade habitable space), but it is growing in urban
renovation, commercial developments, and high-value residential projects. Basement wall
waterproofing uses EPDM on the external (positive) face of the wall before backfilling.
The critical details are the wall-to-floor junction (continuity of the membrane at the
construction joint between slab and wall) and the termination at grade level.

## EPDM vs Bituminous Membranes for Foundation Waterproofing

Bituminous membranes (APP and SBS modified bitumen, torch-applied or self-adhesive) are the
most widely specified foundation waterproofing material in Portugal by volume, primarily due
to cost and installer familiarity. However, the technical comparison with EPDM strongly favours
EPDM for below-grade applications:

**Crack bridging:** EPDM at 300-400% elongation bridges concrete cracks of 5-15 mm width
without rupture. Bituminous membranes at 30-100% elongation (APP type) or 150-250% (SBS type)
have significantly lower crack-bridging capacity. Foundation cracks of 5-15 mm are common due
to concrete shrinkage and settlement in the first 5-10 years of a structure's life.

**Root resistance:** EPDM has demonstrated root resistance per FLL and EN 13948 test methods.
Bituminous membranes are known to be susceptible to root penetration — a significant disadvantage
in below-grade applications where tree and shrub roots follow moisture gradients directly to
the membrane surface.

**Chemical resistance:** As described above, EPDM is resistant to the full range of soil
chemistries encountered in Portugal. SBS bitumen is susceptible to solvent attack from
petroleum hydrocarbons in contaminated soils (petrol station sites, industrial land) and to
alkaline saponification. APP bitumen has better chemical resistance than SBS but is still
susceptible to long-term degradation in humic acid environments.

**Thermal resistance:** Bituminous membranes soften and creep under sustained load at elevated
temperatures. Below-grade temperatures in Portugal range from 12-18°C year-round in the
vadose zone — well below the problem threshold — but where thermal insulation is placed
between the membrane and the slab, surface temperatures on the membrane can rise significantly.
EPDM maintains its properties to 120°C continuous service.

**Service life:** Published independent service life assessments place EPDM at 50+ years under
below-grade conditions. Bituminous membranes in equivalent conditions are assessed at 20-30 years
for SBS type and 25-35 years for APP type, with degradation mechanisms (oxidation, UV in exposed
sections, plasticiser migration in the case of some SBS formulations) limiting service life
in aggressive chemical environments.

## EPDM vs HDPE Geomembranes for Foundation Waterproofing

HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) geomembranes are used in civil engineering applications
including landfill liners, reservoir liners, and — in some specifications — building foundation
waterproofing. The comparison with EPDM for foundation use:

**Flexibility:** HDPE is a semi-crystalline polymer with elongation at break of 700-800% but
a yield point at 12-20% elongation. Beyond the yield point, HDPE undergoes stress whitening
and plastic deformation — it does not return to its original dimensions. This limits its
effective crack-bridging capacity to strains below the yield point in service conditions.
EPDM is fully elastic throughout its deformation range — 300-400% elongation with complete
elastic recovery.

**Seaming:** HDPE geomembranes are seamed by thermal fusion (extrusion welding or hot-wedge
welding) using specialised equipment that is not always available to building waterproofing
contractors. EPDM seams are made with QuickSeam tape and primer — a simpler, faster and
more reliably field-executable method.

**Puncture resistance:** HDPE at 2.0 mm thickness has comparable puncture resistance to EPDM
at 1.5 mm. For foundation applications where the membrane is protected on both sides (by the
concrete above and the blinding/drainage layer below), this is a secondary consideration.

**Cost:** HDPE geomembrane material cost is typically lower than EPDM, but the installation
cost is comparable or higher due to seaming equipment requirements and the specialist training
needed for consistent quality HDPE installation in building (as opposed to civil/geotechnical)
contexts.

**EPDM advantage summary for foundations:** superior elastic crack-bridging, simpler seaming
methodology in building contractor context, better chemical resistance to organic acids and
alkaline environments, no yield point limitation.

## EPDM vs Cementitious Waterproofing for Foundations

Cementitious waterproofing — crystalline waterproofing admixtures (Xypex, Kryton), rigid
cement-based coatings, and polymer-modified cementitious slurries — is widely used in
Portugal for foundation waterproofing, particularly as a primary or secondary barrier on
concrete surfaces.

**Crack bridging:** Cementitious coatings are rigid (0-2% elongation). They provide no crack
bridging. Any structural crack in the concrete propagates directly through the cementitious
coating. Crystalline waterproofing admixtures self-seal fine cracks (< 0.4 mm) through
crystal growth in the crack pathway, but this mechanism is not effective for structural cracks
of > 0.4-0.5 mm.

**Application to non-concrete substrates:** cementitious waterproofing requires a concrete
or masonry substrate. It cannot be applied to pipes, expansion joints, or the membrane-to-pipe
interface. EPDM can waterproof any substrate, including steel pipes, PVC drainage pipes, and
expansion joint elements, with the appropriate primer and adhesive.

**Positive vs negative side:** cementitious waterproofing can be applied on either the positive
(exterior, in contact with water source) or negative (interior, against the water pressure)
face of a structure. EPDM is primarily a positive-side application. For retrofit waterproofing
of existing basements where access to the exterior is not possible, cementitious systems offer
an advantage that EPDM does not. Membriko acknowledges this distinction honestly in all
consultations.

**Service life:** cementitious coatings in below-grade conditions have documented service lives
of 15-25 years before deterioration of the polymer-modified component requires attention.
Crystalline admixtures are considered permanent when correctly applied. EPDM's 50+ year below-
grade service life compares favourably.

## Drainage Integration with EPDM Foundation Waterproofing

Foundation waterproofing and drainage are complementary systems that must be designed together.
A drainage system that removes groundwater before it can build up hydrostatic pressure reduces
the load on the membrane; a membrane that is correctly detailed ensures that any water that
does reach the membrane surface cannot penetrate the structure.

### French Drains (Drenos Franceses)

The standard drainage detail for below-grade construction: a perforated pipe (PVC or PE,
150 mm diameter minimum) laid at the base of the foundation perimeter in a granular drainage
layer (20-40 mm clean aggregate, gravel or crushed stone), wrapped in geotextile filter fabric
to prevent fine soil migration. The French drain collects groundwater before it can build up
against the wall membrane and diverts it to a soakaway, a drainage channel, or a sump pump.

When EPDM waterproofing is used as the wall and floor membrane, the French drain is installed
at the toe of the membrane, with the geotextile and aggregate layer placed against the external
face of the EPDM. A protection board (typically 20-25 mm extruded polystyrene, XPS, or
proprietary drainage/protection composite boards) is placed against the EPDM before backfilling
to prevent aggregate point loads from puncturing the membrane during backfilling and in service.

### Cavity Drainage Systems (Membranas de Drenagem por Cavidade)

In retrofit basement waterproofing where external access is not possible, a cavity drain membrane
(studded HDPE sheet) is applied to the internal wall surface, creating a drained cavity between
the wall and the interior finish. This is a "water management" approach rather than a "water
exclusion" approach. EPDM is not used in this context — this is a genuinely competitive system
where the internal cavity drain is the appropriate solution.

### Combined EPDM + Drainage Board Systems

For new construction, Membriko installs EPDM in conjunction with prefabricated drainage and
protection boards — composite panels that combine a dimpled drainage core with a geotextile
filter bonded to the outer face. These panels are placed against the EPDM membrane before
backfilling, providing simultaneous protection (mechanical protection during backfilling),
drainage (water flow down the dimpled core to the perimeter drain) and filtration (geotextile
prevents fine soil particles from clogging the drainage core).

## Key Standards and Regulations

### Portuguese Building Regulations (RGEU)

The Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas (Decreto-Lei 38382/51, with subsequent amendments)
requires that buildings be watertight against external water ingress, including groundwater.
Article 96 requires that foundations and below-grade structures be protected against humidity
and water infiltration. While the RGEU does not specify the waterproofing method or material,
it establishes the performance obligation. EPDM installed to Membriko's specification meets
this obligation with a documented 50+ year service life.

### EN 13967 — Flexible Sheets for Waterproofing

EN 13967 is the European product standard for flexible sheets for waterproofing of underground
structures (wet area applications: foundations, tunnels, below-grade walls and floors). It
specifies minimum performance requirements for thickness, tensile strength, elongation,
watertightness, and chemical resistance. EPDM sheets used by Membriko for foundation applications
carry CE marking under EN 13967, confirming compliance with these minimum requirements.

### EN 1928 — Watertightness Testing

Method B of EN 1928 (water under pressure) is the watertightness test method referenced in
EN 13967. Membriko specifies membranes that pass at the pressure levels applicable to the
designed water table depth at each project — this is not a generic specification but a
site-specific performance requirement.

### ISO 10318 — Geosynthetics Terminology

Relevant where EPDM is specified in conjunction with drainage geocomposites, geotextile filters
and protection layers. The terminology of the geocomposite drainage systems that complement
EPDM foundation membranes is covered by this standard and its successors.
