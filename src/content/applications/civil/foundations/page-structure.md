# Foundations — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Foundation waterproofing is an invisible but existential problem for building owners. Unlike
a leaking roof — where the failure is immediately visible and emotionally urgent — a foundation
that leaks does so slowly, invisibly and insidiously. By the time a property owner realises
their basement is damp, their ground floor slab is rising, or their structural walls have
efflorescence running down them, the damage to the structure and the interior finishes may
be extensive and the repair disruptive and expensive.

The persuasion architecture for this page must therefore do something different from the pool
or roofing pages: it must first make the reader feel the problem, then demonstrate why the
standard solution (bituminous membrane, applied by the general contractor as an afterthought)
fails predictably, and then introduce EPDM as the material that solves the problem permanently.
The audience is more technically literate than the average residential consumer: engineers,
architects, project managers, technically engaged self-builders and property developers. The
content must reward this audience with genuine technical depth while remaining accessible.

The Pombal/Leiria regional context is important here: the central Portuguese water table
conditions, the prevalence of limestone and alluvial soils, and the specific soil chemistries
of the region are Membriko's lived experience. This is not generic European content — it is
grounded in the specific hydrogeological reality of the territory where Membriko works.

## Section 1: Introduction — Foundation Waterproofing and the Cost of Failure

**Purpose:** Establish the stakes and create urgency around what most people treat as a
secondary consideration.

**Content:**
- Open with the observation that foundation waterproofing is the most consequential
  waterproofing decision on any building — it is installed once, buried under the structure,
  and cannot be replaced without excavation
- The cost of failure: rising damp, mould, structural degradation, reduced property value,
  potential structural instability in severe cases
- The false economy of underspecifying: the typical foundation membrane accounts for 0.5-2%
  of a building's total construction cost, yet its failure can cost multiples of its
  installation value in remediation
- Membriko's position: specialised EPDM foundation waterproofing designed for the water
  table and soil conditions of central Portugal, with 20-year installation warranty and
  50+ year documented membrane service life
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / ≥ 300% elongation to bridge concrete cracks /
  Resistant to pH 4-14 soil chemistry / 20-year Membriko warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Projecto de Impermeabilização"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Foundation Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Make the chemistry case for EPDM in below-grade conditions — the same argument
as for roofing and pools, but reframed for the specific demands of soil contact, hydrostatic
pressure and permanent burial.

**Content:**
- Three unique demands of below-grade waterproofing that no other application presents
  simultaneously: permanent burial (no inspection, no replacement), hydrostatic pressure
  (acting upward on the floor slab, inward on the walls), and soil chemical contact
  (alkaline, acidic, sulphate-bearing, humic acid environments)
- Why EPDM's saturated polymer backbone is intrinsically resistant to each of these:
  chemical inertness, elastic crack-bridging, dimensional stability under sustained load
- Why bituminous membranes — the default — have known failure mechanisms in each of these
  areas: oxidative aging, root penetration, limited elongation, alkaline saponification
- Physical data table (condensed from research summary)
- CE marking under EN 13967 (foundation waterproofing standard)

---

## Section 3: Foundation Types — Strip, Raft, Pile Caps, Basement Walls

**Purpose:** Establish that Membriko's EPDM solution is applicable to every below-grade
foundation configuration, not just one type. Demonstrate technical specificity.

**Content:** Four foundation type cards.

**Strip Foundations (Sapatas Contínuas)**
- Most common type in Portuguese residential construction
- Membrane applied to base and sides of the strip; critical detail at junction with ground
  floor slab; requires flexible termination to accommodate differential movement
- Membriko's experience with this foundation type across the Pombal/Leiria region

**Raft Foundations (Lajes de Fundação)**
- Full-footprint slab used in low-bearing-capacity soils and high water table conditions
- EPDM applied under the raft on the blinding layer before concrete pour; edges turned up
  and lapped to the wall membrane; the membrane is fully enclosed and protected
- Particularly relevant for construction on alluvial zones along central Portuguese river
  corridors (Mondego, Lis, Nabão)

**Pile Caps (Maciços de Encabeçamento)**
- Specialist detail: pre-formed EPDM collar at pile head; adhesion to pile shaft concrete;
  integration with the cap membrane
- Reference to Membriko's experience with pile cap details in civil and commercial projects

**Basement Walls (Paredes de Cave)**
- External face membrane applied before backfilling; critical details at wall-to-floor
  junction, window and door penetrations, and termination at grade level
- Combined with drainage board and French drain for complete basement protection system

---

## Section 4: Hydrostatic Pressure and EPDM

**Purpose:** Address the most technical dimension of foundation waterproofing — the water
pressure that acts on buried membranes — with data and design guidance.

**Content:**
- Explanation of hydrostatic pressure in plain terms: pressure at depth = water head x
  density; at 1 m water table depth, approximately 10 kPa; at 3 m, 30 kPa
- How EPDM performs under this pressure: watertight at 60 kPa per EN 1928 Method B;
  the pressure is sustained indefinitely without creep failure
- Why sustained hydrostatic pressure is a problem for bituminous membranes: creep, blistering
  at unbonded zones, edge peel under sustained lateral pressure
- EPDM's elastic recovery: any transient deformation at high pressure points returns to
  original geometry when pressure is released — relevant for seasonal water table variations
- Site-specific pressure calculation: Membriko calculates the expected hydrostatic pressure
  at each project based on local hydrogeological data and specifies membrane accordingly

## Section 5: Installation Process (8 Steps)

**Purpose:** De-risk the purchase decision by making the process feel systematic, professional
and quality-controlled.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Visita Técnica e Levantamento Hidrogeológico** — Site visit including assessment of soil
   type, existing foundation type, water table indicators (groundwater seepage, historical
   records, neighbouring properties), and structural condition of existing concrete
2. **Projecto de Solução** — Design of the membrane system: thickness specification, adhesion
   method (fully adhered or loose-laid with ballast), drainage integration design, French drain
   specification, material schedule; coordination with structural engineer where required
3. **Preparação da Superfície de Betão** — Concrete surface preparation: removal of sharp
   protrusions and formwork ties; crack repair with polyurethane or epoxy injection; surface
   grinding to remove laitance; blinding layer preparation for raft applications
4. **Impermeabilização do Fundo** — Application of EPDM to the base/floor area: blinding
   layer or protection layer placed; EPDM rolled out, overlaps and seams made with QuickSeam
   tape and QuickPrime Plus primer; edges turned up to meet the wall membrane
5. **Impermeabilização das Paredes** — Application of EPDM to foundation walls: membrane
   applied from the wall-to-floor junction upward; continuity detail at the construction joint;
   termination bar at grade level fixed with stainless steel anchors
6. **Pontos Singulares** — Pipe penetrations, service ducts, construction joints, column
   bases: each detail executed with purpose-made EPDM preformed pieces or EPDM tape/patch
   systems; no mastic or silicone as primary sealant
7. **Camada de Protecção e Drenagem** — Installation of protection and drainage board
   (dimpled PE sheet with geotextile filter) over the wall membrane; French drain pipe at
   the membrane toe; clean aggregate drainage layer; geotextile wrap
8. **Inspecção, Documentação e Garantia** — Visual inspection of all seams and penetrations;
   photographic as-built record; issuance of 20-year Membriko warranty certificate; handover
   of maintenance guide

## Section 6: Critical Details — Wall-to-Floor Junction, Pipe Penetrations, Construction Joints

**Purpose:** Demonstrate deep technical knowledge of the failure points that matter most
in foundation waterproofing. This is the content that separates Membriko from generalist
contractors and earns the trust of engineers and architects.

**Content:**

**Wall-to-Floor Junction (Canto Parede/Laje)**
- The most common failure point in foundation waterproofing; the junction between the floor
  slab and the wall is a construction joint that inevitably moves under differential loading
  and concrete shrinkage; a rigid membrane (bituminous, cementitious) will crack at this point
- EPDM detail: the floor membrane is taken up the wall face by a minimum of 150 mm; the wall
  membrane overlaps this upturn by a minimum of 150 mm; the overlap is seamed with QuickSeam;
  a preformed EPDM cove piece fills the internal angle, ensuring no straight-line path for
  water under pressure

**Pipe Penetrations (Passagens de Tubagem)**
- Service pipes (water supply, drainage, electrical conduit) that pass through foundation
  walls and slabs are major potential leak paths; the pipe-to-membrane interface must
  accommodate both longitudinal movement of the pipe and rotational movement of the structure
- EPDM detail: preformed EPDM pipe boots (manchons de EPDM) or EPDM peel-and-stick flashing
  tape bonded to the pipe and to the field membrane; mechanical compression ring where
  required for high hydrostatic pressure

**Construction Joints (Juntas de Betonagem)**
- Inevitable in any concrete pour: joints between successive pours (wall lifts, slab pours)
  and between different structural elements (slab to wall, slab to pile cap)
- EPDM detail: the membrane bridges the joint continuously; where the joint is expected to
  be subject to significant movement, a formed fold (loop) in the membrane provides a
  reservoir of material that can accommodate movement without tensioning the membrane

## Section 7: EPDM vs Bituminous / HDPE / Cementitious Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Proactively handle competitor comparisons with technical honesty.

**Content:** Comparison table and supporting text.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Bituminous SBS/APP | HDPE Geomembrane | Cementitious |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | 30-250% | 700% (yield at 15%) | 0-2% |
| Effective crack bridging | Up to 15 mm | Up to 3-5 mm | Up to 3 mm (yield) | None |
| Root resistance | Excellent (EN 13948) | Poor to moderate | Good | N/A |
| Chemical resistance (humic acids) | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Good |
| Chemical resistance (alkaline pH > 12) | Excellent | Poor (saponification) | Good | Good |
| Below-grade service life | 50+ years | 20-30 years | 40-50 years | 15-25 years |
| Seaming method | QuickSeam tape (field) | Torch / self-adhesive | Extrusion welding | Brush/trowel |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 140 (partial replacement) | 110 | 160 (multiple reapplications) |

Honest acknowledgement: cementitious crystalline systems offer genuine advantages for negative-
side applications (interior application without excavation) where external access is not possible.
HDPE geomembranes are competitive in large civil foundation plates where material cost is
dominant and seaming is done by specialist plant. Membriko recommends EPDM for above-grade
foundation work on buildings where crack-bridging, root resistance and long-term chemical
resistance are the primary performance requirements.

## Section 8: Drainage Integration — French Drains and Geocomposites

**Purpose:** Show that Membriko understands foundation waterproofing as a system, not just
as a membrane product, and can design and install the complete drainage solution.

**Content:**
- Why drainage and waterproofing must be designed together: a drainage system that reduces
  hydrostatic head reduces the pressure on the membrane; a membrane without drainage relies
  entirely on membrane integrity for protection
- French drain design: perforated pipe diameter, bedding aggregate specification, geotextile
  filter specification (opening size matched to soil particle size distribution), gradient
  and outlet design
- Geocomposite drainage boards: dimpled PE/PP sheet with bonded geotextile; installed
  against the EPDM wall membrane before backfilling; channels water down to the French drain;
  protects the EPDM from backfill aggregate point loads
- Sump pump systems: where the drainage outfall elevation is above the groundwater level,
  collected water must be pumped out; Membriko coordinates the sump chamber design with
  the drainage system
- Portuguese context: the importance of drainage in central Portugal's alluvial zones where
  winter water tables are persistently high

---

## Section 9: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Provide the complete data table for specifiers, engineers and architects.

**Content:** Full technical data table.

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard foundation) | 1.0-1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (high hydrostatic pressure) | 1.5-2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 20 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |
| Watertightness | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 (Method B) |
| Resistance to soil chemicals | pH 4-14, humic acids, sulphates | EN 14374 / ASTM D471 |
| Root resistance | Pass | FLL / EN 13948 |
| Dimensional stability | < 1% at 80°C | EN 1107-2 |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +120°C | — |
| Service life (below-grade) | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ |
| CE marking standard | EN 13967 | — |

## Section 10: Portuguese Soil Conditions and Water Tables

**Purpose:** Demonstrate local knowledge that distinguishes Membriko from generic national
suppliers; give engineers and self-builders confidence that the specification is matched to
the actual site conditions of central Portugal.

**Content:**
- Overview of the main soil and hydrogeological conditions in Portugal relevant to foundation
  waterproofing: the granitic north (acidic, shallow water table), the calcareous centre
  (alkaline, karst, alluvial plains with high water tables), the clay Alentejo (seasonal
  fluctuation, sulphate-bearing), the Algarve (low rainfall, saline coastal aquifers)
- The Pombal/Leiria area in detail: Membriko's home territory; calcareous Jurassic limestone
  plateau to the east (karst drainage, dry in summer, water table variable); alluvial plains
  of the Lis valley to the west (permanently high water table, fine-grained soils, seasonal
  flooding risk); pinhal soils (acidic, high humic acid content from forest litter)
- Practical implication for specification: the specification for a foundation on the Lis
  alluvial plain differs from one on the limestone plateau; Membriko assesses each site
  individually and specifies accordingly
- Reference to seasonal water table variation and the importance of designing for the
  winter maximum, not the summer average

---

## Section 11: Regulations — RGEU, EN 13967, EC7

**Purpose:** Provide the regulatory framework that justifies the investment in quality
foundation waterproofing and that engineers/architects need to reference in their specifications.

**Content:**
- **RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas):** Articles 95-97 require protection
  against humidity and water infiltration in all below-grade structures; performance obligation,
  not method specification; EPDM to EN 13967 meets this obligation
- **EN 13967:** European standard for flexible sheets for waterproofing of underground
  structures and below-ground applications; specifies CE marking requirements, minimum physical
  properties, and test methods; Membriko specifies only EN 13967-compliant membranes
- **EC7 (Eurocode 7 — NP EN 1997):** Geotechnical design standard; classifies groundwater
  conditions and requires design to account for the design water table level; foundation
  waterproofing specification should be based on the EC7 design water table, not the observed
  dry-season water table
- **LNEC and municipal licencing:** Municipal building licences in Portugal require a
  hydrological and geotechnical assessment for structures exceeding defined sizes in flood-
  risk or high-water-table zones; Membriko can provide technical documentation for inclusion
  in licencing submissions

---

## Section 12: New Build vs Retrofit Foundation Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Capture both the new construction market and the existing building remediation
market — both are significant in Portugal.

**Content:**

**New Build (Construção Nova)**
- The ideal scenario: membrane installed on the exterior of the foundation before backfilling;
  no disruption, no excavation, full access to all surfaces
- Sequencing: foundation concrete poured and cured; blinding layer for raft; membrane applied
  to floor and walls; penetrations detailed; protection layer and drain installed; backfilling
- Coordination with the general contractor for sequencing and protection during construction
  — EPDM is vulnerable to traffic damage before protection layer is installed
- Specification note: the membrane must be specified in the building licence documentation
  and in the project specifications (caderno de encargos); Membriko provides technical data
  sheets for inclusion in tender documents

**Retrofit (Reabilitação de Fundações Existentes)**
- The more complex scenario: existing building with moisture problems; external excavation
  required to access the foundation walls and slab edge
- Assessment: structural survey of the existing concrete; identification of active cracks;
  investigation of existing waterproofing (if any) and its condition
- Preparation: crack injection with polyurethane hydro-expansive resin; surface regularisation;
  removal of any failing existing waterproofing
- Limitations: in some existing buildings, full perimeter excavation is not possible (party
  walls, adjacent structures, underground services); Membriko assesses feasibility in the
  site survey and proposes alternative solutions where required
- Portuguese context: much of Portugal's urban building stock dates from the 1950s-1980s
  and was built without adequate foundation waterproofing by modern standards; the retrofit
  market is substantial and growing as this stock ages and moisture damage becomes apparent

---

## Section 13: Common Mistakes in Foundation Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Build trust by showing Membriko's willingness to name the industry's problems
and position Membriko as the solution to those problems.

**Content:**
- **Membrane applied to wet or contaminated concrete:** adhesion failure within months of
  installation; the concrete must be clean, dry and free of release agents, oil and standing
  water before membrane application
- **Inadequate seam width:** EN 13967 requires seam widths of ≥ 100 mm; seams made at less
  than this width are vulnerable to peel under hydrostatic pressure; Membriko uses 150 mm
  QuickSeam tape as standard
- **No protection layer before backfilling:** the EPDM membrane is damaged by angular
  aggregate during backfilling operations; protection board is not optional — it is the
  difference between a 50-year installation and a 5-year failure
- **Skipping the wall-to-floor junction detail:** the most common single point of failure in
  Portuguese foundation waterproofing; general contractors unfamiliar with the detail omit
  the cove piece and rely on a straight-seam junction that cracks within years of structure
  movement
- **Underspecifying for the actual water table:** specifying for the summer observed water
  table rather than the winter maximum design water table; in alluvial zones of central
  Portugal, the difference can be 2-4 m of hydrostatic head
- **Using a bituminous membrane installer for EPDM:** EPDM seaming technique is different
  from torch-applied bitumen; using installers trained only in bituminous systems produces
  substandard EPDM installations; Membriko's team is trained specifically in EPDM systems

---

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales queries.

1. **Qual a diferença entre impermeabilização de fundações e tratamento anti-humidade?**
   Foundation waterproofing creates a physical barrier against liquid water under hydrostatic
   pressure. Anti-humidity treatments (silicone injections, surface sealers) address capillary
   moisture rise in existing walls. They solve different problems. For foundations with a water
   table, a full membrane system is required — surface treatments are ineffective against
   hydrostatic pressure.

2. **É possível impermeabilizar fundações de um edifício existente sem escavar?**
   In most cases, external excavation is required for an external EPDM membrane. For buildings
   where external access is not possible, internal cavity drain systems or negative-side
   cementitious waterproofing may be considered — Membriko assesses each case honestly and
   recommends the appropriate solution for the situation, even when that solution is not EPDM.

3. **O EPDM resiste às raízes de árvores e arbustos próximos da fundação?**
   Yes. EPDM is the material used as root-barrier membrane in extensive green roofs per EN 13948
   and FLL test methods. The same root resistance applies to tree roots growing toward the
   foundation moisture source. This is a known failure mechanism for bituminous foundation
   membranes and a specific advantage of EPDM in the Portuguese context, where proximity of
   large trees (pines, eucalyptus, cork oaks) to foundations is common.

4. **Qual a espessura correcta de membrana EPDM para fundações?**
   Standard residential foundation waterproofing uses 1.0-1.5 mm EPDM. For high hydrostatic
   pressure conditions (water table within 1 m of the foundation slab, or basement depths
   exceeding 2 m), Membriko specifies 1.5-2.0 mm. The specification is made after assessment
   of the site hydrogeology, not from a generic standard.

5. **A membrana EPDM resiste ao betão alcalino e aos solos ácidos do pinhal?**
   Yes to both. EPDM is chemically inert to alkaline environments up to pH 14 — including
   the highly alkaline environment at the concrete surface where pH can reach 12-13 during
   the first years of concrete curing. In the acidic pinhal soils of the Leiria region, EPDM
   is equally inert to organic acids and humic acids, which are known to degrade bituminous
   membranes over time.

6. **Como é que a Membriko integra a drenagem com a impermeabilização?**
   Membriko designs and installs the complete foundation protection system: EPDM membrane,
   geocomposite drainage board (placed against the membrane before backfilling), French drain
   pipe at the membrane toe, clean aggregate layer, geotextile filter, and sump pump chamber
   where required. The drainage and waterproofing systems are designed as an integrated unit,
   not specified separately and then combined on site.

7. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para impermeabilização de fundações?**
   Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty on all foundation waterproofing work,
   supplementary to the manufacturer's product warranty on the EPDM membrane and to the 5-year
   statutory defects liability under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Art. 1225). The
   warranty certificate is issued at project completion and is transferable to subsequent owners
   of the property.

8. **O EPDM para fundações é o mesmo produto que o EPDM de coberturas?**
   The base polymer chemistry is the same, but foundation-grade EPDM is supplied in formats
   optimised for below-grade application: self-adhesive backing systems for bonding to damp
   or complex substrates, fleece-backed versions for mechanical protection against aggregate,
   and CE marking under EN 13967 (underground waterproofing standard) rather than EN 13956
   (roofing standard). Membriko specifies only EN 13967-compliant membranes for foundation
   applications.
