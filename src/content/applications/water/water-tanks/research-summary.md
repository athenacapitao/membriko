# Water Tanks (Depósitos de Água) — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Water Tank Lining: Core Technical Rationale

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is one of the most widely used elastomers in industrial
water containment globally. Its suitability for water tank lining derives from the same molecular
architecture that makes it effective in roofing, pool lining and civil waterproofing: a fully
saturated carbon-carbon backbone that is chemically inert to virtually all agents present in
water storage environments — oxidising biocides, dissolved minerals, organic compounds and
UV radiation.

Water tanks present a distinct set of technical challenges compared with pools:

- Higher volume-to-surface-area ratios, meaning structural movement has a greater relative
  effect on the liner than in a shallow pool
- Frequent or continuous full immersion without seasonal draining, unlike roofing membranes
- In concrete tanks, carbonation and shrinkage cracking are more pronounced than in pool
  shells due to longer spans and thinner walls
- Potable water tanks require compliance with strict migration standards (no plasticisers,
  no heavy metals, no organic compound leaching above defined thresholds)
- Industrial and fire water tanks may be subject to high-temperature process water, aggressive
  pH conditions, or heavy suspended solids
- Underground tanks are subject to groundwater back-pressure when empty, requiring mechanical
  properties that resist hydrostatic uplift without the support of stored water

EPDM's physical properties address all of these challenges simultaneously:

- Elongation at break ≥ 400%: accommodates structural movement and cracking in concrete
  tank walls and floors without membrane failure
- Water absorption < 1% (ASTM D471): retains dimensional and mechanical properties under
  continuous immersion
- Hardness 55-70 Shore A: resistant to abrasion from sediment, cleaning equipment and
  installation foot traffic
- Service temperature range -45°C to +130°C (continuous immersion to +80°C): suitable for
  cold water storage, fire water storage (which must function at ambient conditions down to
  -10°C in northern Portugal) and low-temperature industrial process water
- Tensile strength 9-12 N/mm²: resists hydrostatic pressure in deep tanks without creep
  or permanent deformation
- No plasticisers: the defining property for potable water contact — EPDM's flexibility is
  intrinsic to its vulcanised elastomer structure, not dependent on migrating additives

## Potable Water Compliance and Certification

The regulatory and certification framework for materials in contact with potable water is
more stringent than for pool water, and correctly so. Potable water is consumed directly;
any compound migrating from a tank liner into the stored water becomes a potential health
issue at the point of consumption.

**WRAS (Water Regulations Advisory Scheme) — United Kingdom**
WRAS approval under BS 6920 is the most internationally recognised certification for materials
in contact with potable water. BS 6920 tests for:
- Odour: no taint above threshold after specified contact at 23°C and 60°C
- Taste: no detectable taint in organoleptic panel testing
- Turbidity: no increase in turbidity of stored water
- Colour: no colour imparted to water above 3 Hazen units
- Metal extraction: no metals above WHO guideline values for drinking water
- Organic compound extraction: no specific organic compounds (sulphur compounds from
  vulcanisation, antioxidant breakdown products, carbon black extractables) above limits

WRAS-approved EPDM for tank lining is available from multiple European manufacturers.
WRAS approval is routinely specified by UK water authorities for all materials in contact
with drinking water infrastructure; many export markets — including Portuguese industrial
and municipal projects — reference WRAS as the benchmark certification.

**NSF/ANSI 61 — United States and International**
NSF Standard 61 covers drinking water system components including tank liners. NSF 61 testing
evaluates migration of contaminants into water at conditions simulating in-service use (contact
at 23°C and 60°C, specific contact period, water composition mimicking aggressive potable water).
NSF 61 certified EPDM is the standard specification in North American water infrastructure and
is increasingly referenced in international infrastructure projects including those co-financed
by the World Bank or European Investment Bank.

**ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire) — France**
The ACS is the French national certification for materials in contact with water intended for
human consumption. It evaluates the same migration parameters as WRAS and KTW but under
the French regulatory framework (Arrêté du 29 mai 1997). ACS-certified EPDM formulations
are commonly specified in Francophone markets and are accepted as equivalent to WRAS in
most EU procurement specifications.

**KTW (Kunststoffe und Trinkwasser) — Germany**
KTW is the German guideline for plastics in contact with drinking water, administered by the
Umweltbundesamt. KTW-listed EPDM holds concurrent ACS certification in most cases. KTW
is the reference standard for German water authority (Wasserversorger) procurement and is
frequently referenced in Central and Eastern European water infrastructure projects.

**Portuguese regulatory context:**
Portugal follows EU Directive 2020/2184 (recast of Directive 98/83/EC) on drinking water
quality. This Directive requires Member States to ensure that materials in contact with potable
water do not compromise water quality and human health. In Portugal, implementation is governed
by Decreto-Lei 152/2017 and its successor regulations. Materials in contact with drinking water
are required to comply with European standards for migration — WRAS, ACS, KTW or NSF 61
certification is the accepted method of demonstrating compliance. EPDM without such certification
should not be used in potable water contact applications.

Fire water storage tanks and grey water storage tanks do not require potable water certification
but must be chemically compatible with the stored water and any treatment additives.

## Tank Types and Structural Considerations

### Concrete Tanks

Reinforced concrete is the most common material for large water storage tanks in Portugal —
municipal water towers, agricultural irrigation reservoirs, farm water storage, industrial
process water, and fire water tanks. Concrete tanks are durable structures but they are
intrinsically porous and crack-prone:

- Shrinkage cracking: concrete shrinks as it cures; in thin-walled tanks, crack widths of
  0.1-0.3 mm are normal even in well-designed structures. These cracks are sufficient to
  allow water migration without a liner.
- Carbonation: atmospheric CO₂ reacts with calcium hydroxide in the cement paste, reducing
  pH and progressively advancing a carbonation front through the concrete cover. In thin
  concrete tank walls (100-150 mm), carbonation can reach the reinforcement in 20-30 years
  in humid Portuguese coastal conditions.
- Thermal cycling: outdoor concrete tanks in Portugal experience daily temperature cycles of
  10-25°C in summer and seasonal cycles of 25-35°C. These cycles cause fatigue cracking over
  time in concrete without flexible waterproofing protection.

The correct lining system for concrete tanks is therefore an elastomeric membrane — not a
rigid coating — that can bridge existing cracks and accommodate future crack movement. EPDM
with 400% elongation can bridge cracks up to several millimetres without rupture. A 0.3 mm
concrete shrinkage crack produces a local membrane strain of approximately 0.2% at 1.5 mm
membrane thickness — completely within EPDM's elastic range.

### Steel Tanks

Steel tanks — both above-ground bolted panel tanks and welded steel vessels — are common in
industrial applications, fire water storage (above-ground GRP-coated steel tanks are standard
in Portuguese industrial parks) and agricultural use. Unlined steel tanks corrode; the corrosion
products contaminate stored water and progressive pitting leads to structural failure.

EPDM lining of steel tanks provides:
- Complete separation of the stored water from the steel substrate
- Prevention of corrosion product contamination
- Electrolytic isolation (EPDM is an electrical insulator — relevant for tanks in
  electrochemically active soils or near impressed-current cathodic protection systems)
- Acoustic damping (reduces thermal expansion noise in large steel tanks)

EPDM adhesion to primed steel surfaces is achieved with specific contact adhesives formulated
for metal substrates. The membrane is typically mechanically anchored at the top perimeter with
stainless steel clamping profiles in addition to adhesive bonding.

### Underground / Below-Ground Tanks

Underground tanks present the most demanding installation conditions for any lining system.
Additional challenges include:

- Access: installation through hatches, manholes or temporary top openings; no access for
  heavy machinery
- Back-pressure: when empty for inspection or maintenance, groundwater exerts upward hydrostatic
  pressure on the floor and inward pressure on the walls if the water table is above tank base
  level. EPDM, when fully adhered to the substrate, resists back-pressure; a partially adhered
  or loose-laid liner would blister and lift.
- Ventilation: confined space regulations (Portaria 762/2002 and updates; EN 15001 for gas
  safety) apply to work in enclosed underground tanks; all installation work must comply with
  ATEX zone requirements and confined space entry procedures
- Moisture: underground tanks are often moist even when drained; EPDM adhesives must be
  compatible with damp substrates or application must be coordinated with drying protocols

For underground tanks, the Membriko installation method uses a fully bonded system with
immersion-grade contact adhesive rated for damp-surface application, combined with perimeter
mechanical anchoring at the tank top edge.

### Sectional and Modular Tanks

Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP / fibreglass) sectional tanks are widely installed in industrial
and commercial premises as break tanks, buffer tanks and fire water tanks. Over time, GRP
sections develop gel coat crazing, and gasket seals at section joints deteriorate. EPDM can
be used to line GRP sectional tanks, providing a continuous inner membrane that eliminates
the joint sealing issue. This is a cost-effective rehabilitation approach that avoids full
tank replacement.

## EPDM vs Alternative Tank Lining Systems

### Liquid-Applied Coatings (Epoxy, Polyurethane, Bitumen)

Liquid-applied coatings for water tanks are widely used but have structural limitations that
become significant over time:

**Epoxy coatings (2-component, solvent-free):**
- Typical DFT: 400-600 µm (0.4-0.6 mm)
- Zero elongation: any crack in the substrate propagates directly through the epoxy film
- Recoating interval: 7-15 years depending on substrate and service conditions; full preparation
  (blast cleaning to SA 2.5) required at each recoating
- Potable water grades: available (NSF 61 certified); however, application requires strict
  temperature and humidity control for proper cure; inadequate cure results in amine blush and
  failed adhesion
- Sensitivity: pinholes, holidays and thin spots are common in liquid-applied systems; tank
  must be inspected by holiday testing (electrical detection) after application

**Polyurea / polyurethane coatings:**
- Higher elongation than epoxy (20-50% vs 0-5%)
- Faster application (plural component spray; sets in seconds)
- Higher cost per m² than EPDM sheet; requires heated plural-component spray equipment
- Potable water grades: available (NSF 61 certified spray polyurea exists)
- Limitations: surface preparation is critical; adhesion to damp or contaminated concrete is
  problematic; repair requires specialist equipment

**Cementitious waterproofing (crystalline or polymer-modified):**
- Rigid: no crack bridging beyond hairline cracks (< 0.1 mm)
- Potable water compatible: natural cement is inherently non-toxic
- Useful as a base course to stabilise a carbonated or contaminated concrete surface before
  an elastomeric liner system

### Unplasticised PVC (uPVC) Sheet

uPVC sheet liners for tanks are available in 1-3 mm thickness. Unlike pool PVC liners, tank
liners are typically unplasticised, which eliminates the plasticiser migration issue. However:
- uPVC has very low elongation (2-5%); not suitable for cracked concrete tanks
- uPVC becomes brittle below 0°C; in tanks exposed to cold in northern Portugal or at altitude,
  this is a limitation
- Seaming requires heat welding equipment; weld quality is dependent on operator skill
- uPVC has lower chemical resistance than EPDM to ozone and some industrial chemicals

### HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) Geomembrane

HDPE geomembranes (0.5-2.5 mm) are widely used in civil engineering applications — landfill
liners, lagoon liners, reservoir liners. For tank applications:
- HDPE has excellent chemical resistance and is low cost per m²
- HDPE has low elongation (15-25%); not suitable for cracked concrete tanks
- Seaming requires extrusion welding or thermal fusion equipment; weld testing is required
- HDPE is not typically certified for potable water contact (geomembrane grade); potable water
  grades exist but at higher cost

EPDM outperforms HDPE for tank lining in cracked concrete or steel substrates due to the
superior elongation and the fully bonded installation method.

## Portugal-Specific Water Storage Context

### Municipal and Rural Water Supply

Portugal's water supply infrastructure includes a large number of ageing concrete storage tanks
(reservatórios) operated by municipal utilities (Câmaras Municipais) and water companies (e.g.,
AdP group subsidiaries). Many of these tanks were built in the 1960s-1990s and are at or past
the design service life of their original waterproofing coatings. Bituminous coatings from this
era are failing; epoxy recoatings from the 1990s and 2000s require another cycle of rehabilitation.

The renovation market for municipal water tanks in Portugal is significant. AdP (Águas de
Portugal) and ERSAR (Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos) publish infrastructure
condition data indicating that tank rehabilitation is a priority investment for water utilities
across the country. EPDM lining of existing concrete reservatórios offers 50+ years service
life after a single installation — avoiding the 7-15 year recoating cycle of liquid-applied systems.

### Agricultural Water Storage

Portugal's agricultural sector — particularly in the Alentejo, where drip-irrigation of olive
groves, vineyards and cork oak plantations requires large water reserves — relies heavily on
on-farm storage tanks. These range from small ferro-cement cisterns of 10,000-50,000 litres to
large concrete or earth-banked reservoirs of 1-5 million litres.

EPDM lining is the standard solution for agricultural reservoir lining in Europe. Its root
resistance (EN 13948) is relevant for reservoirs where vegetation grows along the banks. Its
UV stability is critical for exposed reservoir liners in the Alentejo, where solar radiation
is among the highest in continental Europe (GHI 1,700-1,900 kWh/m²/year).

### Fire Water Storage

Portuguese fire safety regulations (Decreto-Lei 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008 — SCIE,
Sistema de Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios) require fire water storage tanks in all
industrial buildings with fire risk categories above a threshold. These tanks must:
- Store water at a defined volume (typically 50,000-500,000 litres depending on risk category)
- Maintain water quality (no contamination from liner) as the water must function in fire hose
  reels and sprinkler systems without damaging pump seals
- Remain serviceable at ambient temperatures including winter conditions

EPDM lining is appropriate for fire water tanks. The certification requirement is for chemical
compatibility with the stored water and the fire fighting equipment — WRAS/NSF 61 certification
satisfies these requirements. Fire water tanks are typically not subject to potable water
regulations but must not contaminate the water in ways that damage pump seals or nozzles.

### Industrial Process Water

Industrial process water tanks in Portugal's food and beverage sector (wine, olive oil, cork
processing), chemical sector (industrial parks in Sines, Estarreja, Barreiro), pharmaceutical
sector (Cantanhede bioscience park) and textile sector (Covilhã, Guimarães) require tank lining
systems tailored to their specific process water chemistry.

The pH range of EPDM resistance (4.0-12.0) and its broad chemical compatibility cover the
majority of industrial process water applications in Portugal's main industrial sectors. For
highly acidic (pH < 4) or strongly oxidising industrial water, specific EPDM formulation
suitability should be confirmed against the process water chemical analysis.

## Installation Considerations Specific to Tanks

### Access and Confined Space

Tank interiors are confined spaces under Portuguese and EU health and safety legislation. Any
work inside a closed tank must comply with:
- Portaria 762/2002 (Regulamento de Segurança e Saúde no Trabalho em Estaleiros de
  Construção) and its updates
- EN 50073 / ATEX Directive 2014/34/EU for potentially explosive atmospheres (relevant in
  tanks that previously stored hydrocarbons)
- Monitoring of oxygen levels, toxic gas levels and temperature before and during confined
  space work
- Rescue equipment and trained rescue team available at the tank opening during all interior work

The Membriko team is trained in confined space entry procedures and carries the required gas
detection equipment and safety harness systems for tank installation projects.

### Moisture and Preparation

Concrete tank surfaces must be dry before adhesive-bonded EPDM installation. In underground
tanks or tanks with active groundwater seepage, drying may require forced ventilation and
heating for 24-72 hours before installation. Any active water seepage points must be stopped
with expanding polyurethane grout before EPDM installation.

### Joint Details at Penetrations

Tanks have multiple penetrations: inlet pipes, outlet pipes (typically at different elevations
for draw-off and emergency), overflow connections, sump drains and vent pipes. Each penetration
requires a watertight EPDM detail using pre-formed pipe collars or flanged EPDM termination
rings, mechanically compressed against the membrane with stainless steel bolted flanges.
The number and complexity of penetrations is greater in tanks than in pools.

### Testing After Installation

After EPDM installation, tanks are filled with clean water to full operating level and held for
a minimum of 72 hours before the level is measured against a fixed datum. A level drop of more
than 5 mm/day (corrected for temperature-driven density change) indicates a leak that must be
located and repaired. For potable water tanks, a water quality test (turbidity, colour, odour,
basic chemical analysis) is performed after filling before the tank is commissioned for potable
supply.
