# Water Tanks (Depósitos de Água) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Water tank lining is a technically specialist application that sits at the intersection of
civil engineering, water quality regulation and long-term asset management. The page must
serve three distinct audiences:

1. **Municipal and utility engineers** responsible for the rehabilitation of concrete water
   reservoirs (reservatórios) — people who think in terms of 30-year infrastructure cycles,
   regulatory compliance, and whole-life cost
2. **Agricultural and rural property owners** with concrete or steel water storage tanks for
   irrigation or domestic supply — people who need a practical, long-lasting solution without
   the disruption and cost of tank replacement
3. **Industrial facility managers and specifiers** seeking EPDM-lined fire water tanks,
   process water tanks, or factory storage with potable water compliance documentation

The persuasion architecture differs from the pool page. The pool page leads with cultural
resonance and aesthetic aspiration. The tank page leads with the engineering case: concrete
tanks leak by design unless they have an elastomeric liner; no coating-based system survives
more than 15 years; EPDM is the only single-installation, 50-year solution.

The page must also address the unique regulatory dimension of potable water contact — WRAS
and NSF 61 certification — which is a non-negotiable specification requirement in many tank
rehabilitation projects. Membriko's ability to provide these certifications is a key
competitive differentiator.

Portugal's specific context — ageing municipal infrastructure, the Alentejo's dependence on
on-farm water storage, fire water requirements in industrial parks — should be integrated
naturally throughout, grounding the technical content in the reader's real experience.

## Section 1: Introduction — Water Storage in Portugal and the Tank Lining Problem

**Purpose:** Establish the problem context and Membriko's answer before any technical detail.

**Content:**
- Open with the scale of water storage in Portugal: municipal reservatórios, agricultural
  tanks in the Alentejo, fire water tanks on industrial estates, domestic cisterns
- The universal problem: concrete leaks. Unlined concrete allows water loss through
  hairline cracks and porosity; coatings fail in 7-15 years; tank replacement is expensive
  and disruptive
- EPDM as the solution: an elastomeric membrane that accommodates crack movement, resists
  chemical attack, is certified for potable water contact, and lasts 50+ years
- Membriko's position: Pombal-based specialists who work on tanks from 10,000 L farm cisterns
  to multi-million litre municipal reservatórios
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / 400% elongation / WRAS certified / 20-year Membriko
  warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação Técnica"

## Section 2: Why EPDM is the Right Material for Water Tanks

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the chemistry and physics argument for EPDM over
coatings, paint and alternative liners.

**Content:**
- The two fundamental requirements for any tank liner: watertightness and chemical safety
  (no contamination of stored water)
- EPDM's saturated backbone: no plasticisers, no migration, no chemical degradation under
  continuous immersion; 50+ years immersion data from civil engineering applications
- The elongation argument: 400% elongation bridges existing cracks and accommodates future
  movement; epoxy (0% elongation) does not
- Physical properties table:

  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness | 1.5 mm (standard) / 2.0 mm (industrial) | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | Hydrostatic resistance | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 (Method B) |
  | Water absorption | < 1% by mass | ASTM D471 |
  | pH resistance | 4.0 to 12.0 | — |
  | Service temperature | -45°C to +80°C (immersion) | — |
  | Potable water certification | WRAS / NSF 61 / ACS | — |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ/Arrhenius |

- Certifications: WRAS (BS 6920), NSF/ANSI 61, ACS (France), KTW (Germany) — what each
  means and why it matters for tank applications in Portugal

---

## Section 3: Tank Types — Concrete, Steel, Underground and Sectional

**Purpose:** Establish that Membriko's EPDM solution is appropriate for every tank type and
structural form.

**Content:** Four tank type cards.

**Concrete Tanks (Tanques de Betão)**
- Most common type in Portugal for municipal and agricultural use; subject to shrinkage
  cracking, carbonation and thermal cycling; EPDM bridges cracks up to several mm
- Typical applications: municipal reservatórios, agricultural irrigation tanks, domestic
  cisterns, rainwater harvesting tanks

**Steel Tanks (Tanques de Aço)**
- Above-ground and buried steel tanks; corrosion protection critical; EPDM provides
  complete separation of water from metal substrate
- Typical applications: industrial fire water, buffer tanks, factory process water storage

**Underground Tanks (Tanques Enterrados)**
- Highest technical complexity: back-pressure when empty, confined space access, moisture
  in substrate; fully bonded EPDM resists back-pressure
- Typical applications: buried cisterns, municipal service reservoirs, underground fire
  water tanks

**Sectional and GRP Tanks (Tanques Modulares e GRP)**
- GRP sectional tanks with deteriorated gel coat and failed joint gaskets; EPDM continuous
  inner liner eliminates joint sealing issues
- Typical applications: commercial building break tanks, roof-mounted cold water storage,
  industrial buffer tanks

## Section 4: EPDM Lining for Existing Tanks — Renovation Without Demolition

**Purpose:** The renovation case — most tank projects are not new-build but rehabilitation
of existing structures with failing coatings.

**Content:**
- The rehabilitation argument: a concrete tank in structurally sound condition can be
  rehabilitated with EPDM and serve 50+ further years; demolition and reconstruction costs
  3-5x more and takes the asset out of service for months
- What EPDM can be installed over:
  - Bare concrete (after cleaning and preparation)
  - Epoxy-coated concrete (if well-adhered; light mechanical keying required)
  - Bituminous coating (if stable; partial delamination requires removal)
  - Cementitious renders and tanking coatings
- What must be addressed before installation:
  - Active leaks: inject with polyurethane hydro-expanding grout
  - Loose or delaminating surface material: mechanically remove
  - Contamination (oil, biological fouling): clean and treat
- Cost comparison: EPDM rehabilitation vs liquid-applied recoating vs tank replacement
- Note on internal coatings that preceded EPDM: in potable water tanks, any existing coating
  must be confirmed as non-toxic before EPDM is installed over it; Membriko verifies this
  during the technical assessment

---

## Section 6: Potable Water Compliance — WRAS, NSF 61 and Portuguese Regulation

**Purpose:** Address the compliance requirement head-on — this is often the decisive factor
in municipal and commercial tank projects.

**Content:**
- Why potable water contact matters: any compound migrating from a liner into drinking water
  is a public health issue; regulatory compliance is both legal obligation and professional
  due diligence
- WRAS (BS 6920) explained: the UK standard referenced globally; tests for odour, taste,
  turbidity, colour, metal extraction and organic compound migration
- NSF/ANSI 61 explained: the US/international standard; also evaluates migration at standard
  and elevated temperature; routinely specified in international infrastructure projects
- ACS (France) and KTW (Germany): European equivalents; accepted as equivalent to WRAS in EU
  procurement
- Portuguese regulatory framework: EU Directive 2020/2184 transposed in Decreto-Lei 152/2017;
  ERSAR requirements for tank rehabilitation projects; Membriko provides full certification
  documentation for each project
- What Membriko provides: certification copies for the specific EPDM product installed;
  migration test data; installation record; water quality test results after commissioning

## Section 7: EPDM vs Epoxy Coatings, Polyurea and PVC — Honest Comparison

**Purpose:** Proactively handle the competitive comparison. Many engineers will have specified
epoxy or polyurea for tank rehabilitation before encountering EPDM.

**Content:** Comparison table.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Epoxy Coating | Polyurea Spray | uPVC Sheet |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation | ≥ 400% | 0-2% | 20-50% | 2-5% |
| Crack bridging | Excellent (up to 5 mm) | None | Limited (< 1 mm) | None |
| Potable water cert. | WRAS / NSF 61 | Available (grade-specific) | Available (grade-specific) | Available |
| Service life | 50+ years | 7-15 years | 15-25 years | 20-30 years |
| Recoating required | No | Every 7-15 years | Every 15-25 years | No |
| Installation in damp | Yes (damp-tolerant adhesive) | No (strict moisture limits) | Limited | No |
| Repair method | Patch bonding | Grind and recoat | Specialist spray repair | Heat welding |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 200 (2 recoatings) | 150 | 120 |

Honest acknowledgement: for tanks with structurally sound, crack-free concrete in a
controlled-humidity environment, high-build epoxy is a technically acceptable solution at
lower initial cost. Polyurea spray is faster to apply for very large surface areas and can
be competitive on large-volume civil tanks. Membriko recommends EPDM where crack bridging
is required, where long-term service life without recoating is a priority, or where the
installed cost including the 50-year lifecycle is the decision criterion.

## Section 8: Structural Integration — Large Tanks and Complex Geometries

**Purpose:** Demonstrate competence in the more complex tank applications that go beyond
standard residential-scale cisterns.

**Content:**
- Large concrete reservatórios: internal height 3-6 m; EPDM installation on vertical walls
  requires mechanical restraint at intermediate levels (horizontal restraint strips) to prevent
  membrane slumping before adhesive cure; Membriko's approach to tall vertical walls
- Tanks with internal columns and baffles: EPDM wrapped around internal structural elements;
  pre-formed EPDM column wraps and internal corner pieces
- Floating cover / flexible cover integration: EPDM tank liner integrated with a floating
  EPDM cover membrane in open-top tanks (agricultural reservoirs) to prevent evaporation
  and biological growth
- Overflow and weir details: EPDM liner taken over concrete weir edges with stainless steel
  termination bars; overflow channel lining integrated with main tank liner
- Access hatch and manhole details: EPDM taken around access opening frames with pre-formed
  EPDM collars; stainless steel compression flanges

## Section 10: Maintenance and Inspection

**Purpose:** Demonstrate low ongoing maintenance cost and provide practical guidance.

**Content:**
- Annual maintenance: no liner-specific maintenance required; normal tank maintenance
  (cleaning, water quality monitoring) is sufficient
- Cleaning: EPDM tank liners can be cleaned with pressure washing (up to 150 bar), nylon
  brushes and standard biocide treatments compatible with EPDM
- Recommended inspection programme: annual visual inspection of liner surface, seams,
  and penetration details; look for any mechanical damage from maintenance equipment or
  access ladder contact; check termination details at tank edges
- Repair if damage occurs: EPDM repair patches bonded with QuickSeam tape; emergency
  repair possible with underwater adhesive in tanks that cannot be emptied immediately;
  permanent repair requires draining and dry-condition patch bonding
- Potable water quality monitoring: regular water quality testing is required by ERSAR for
  municipal tanks regardless of liner type; Membriko recommends a post-rehabilitation
  quality test before returning the tank to service and annually thereafter

## Section 11: Portuguese Water Regulations and Standards

**Purpose:** Complete the regulatory picture for municipal, industrial and private clients.

**Content:**
- Decreto-Lei 152/2017: implementation of EU Directive 98/83/EC on drinking water quality;
  materials in contact with potable water must not compromise water quality
- EU Directive 2020/2184: recast drinking water directive; requires Member States to establish
  lists of approved materials and substances in contact with drinking water
- ERSAR (Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos): the Portuguese water and
  waste services regulator; infrastructure rehabilitation requirements and performance
  indicators for water utilities
- Portaria 1532/2008 (SCIE): fire safety regulations requiring fire water storage in industrial
  buildings; tank lining requirements for fire water tanks
- Decreto-Lei 220/2008: legal framework for fire safety (SCIE); specifies minimum fire water
  storage volumes by risk category
- EN 13956: European standard for synthetic polymer flexible sheets for waterproofing;
  the base product standard for EPDM membranes; CE marking required
- Membriko provides a full documentation package for each project: CE declaration of performance,
  WRAS/NSF 61 certification copies, installation record, photographic record, water quality
  test results

---

## Section 12: Fire Water Storage Tanks

**Purpose:** Address this specific and regulated market segment that is often overlooked
in EPDM tank content.

**Content:**
- Regulatory context: SCIE legislation (Portaria 1532/2008, Decreto-Lei 220/2008) requires
  fire water tanks in all Category 3+ risk buildings; minimum volumes range from 50,000 L
  to 500,000 L depending on use category and risk level
- Technical requirements for fire water tank liners: chemical compatibility with water stored
  for years without circulation; compatibility with pump seals; resistance to temperature
  fluctuations; maintenance of water quality
- EPDM for fire water tanks: no plasticiser release that could damage pump seals; WRAS
  certification confirms water quality; 50-year service life eliminates rehabilitation during
  building service life
- Common configurations in Portugal: below-ground concrete tanks beneath industrial
  building aprons; above-ground steel panel tanks; GRP sectional tanks in the plant room
- Membriko experience: fire water tank lining as a specific installation type, often
  combined with new building construction or as part of SCIE compliance upgrade programmes

---

## Section 13: Industrial Water Tanks

**Purpose:** Address the industrial water storage market — a technically demanding segment
with specific pH and temperature requirements.

**Content:**
- Industrial process water in Portugal's key sectors: food and beverage (wine, olive oil,
  cork), chemicals (Sines, Estarreja), pharmaceuticals (Cantanhede), textiles (Covilhã)
- pH compatibility: EPDM stable from pH 4 to 12; covers the majority of industrial process
  water conditions in Portugal's primary industrial sectors
- Temperature compatibility: service temperature up to +80°C under immersion — suitable for
  hot process water storage at typical industrial temperatures
- Chemical resistance table: resistance to common industrial process water components
  (dilute acids, dilute alkalis, salts, organic compounds, biological treatment water)
- Case for EPDM over epoxy in industrial tanks: EPDM's elongation bridges tank shell
  movement from thermal expansion at industrial operating temperatures; epoxy coatings
  develop stress cracks in tanks cycling between 20°C and 60°C
- Confined space compliance: all Membriko tank installations in industrial facilities are
  conducted under full confined space entry procedures with site-specific risk assessment

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales queries.

1. **Posso impermeabilizar um depósito de betão antigo sem o demolir?**
   Yes — the most common application. Structural concrete can be rehabilitated with EPDM
   regardless of age, provided the concrete is structurally sound. Cracks, porosity and
   failed coatings are addressed during preparation; the EPDM liner bridges all future
   crack movement. Demolition is only required if the concrete structure itself is failing.

2. **A membrana EPDM é certificada para depósitos de água potável?**
   Yes. Membriko specifies EPDM certified to WRAS (BS 6920) and/or NSF/ANSI 61 for all
   potable water contact applications. These certifications demonstrate zero migration of
   plasticisers, heavy metals or organic compounds into the stored water above health-based
   thresholds. Full certification documentation is provided with each project.

3. **Qual é a diferença entre EPDM para depósitos e EPDM para coberturas?**
   The base polymer chemistry is identical. The differences are the antioxidant package
   (formulated for continuous water immersion rather than atmospheric exposure), the potable
   water certifications (WRAS/NSF 61 — not required for roofing), and the installation
   adhesive system (rated for permanent immersion). Membriko specifies immersion-grade
   EPDM for all water storage applications, never standard roofing-grade membrane.

4. **O EPDM aguenta a pressão hidrostática num depósito com 4 metros de água?**
   Yes. A 4 m water column generates approximately 40 kPa hydrostatic pressure. EPDM
   membrane passes the EN 1928 hydrostatic test at 60 kPa. The fully bonded installation
   method distributes this pressure across the adhesive bond to the substrate; the membrane
   is not unsupported. Tanks up to 8-10 m internal depth are within EPDM's hydrostatic
   capacity when properly installed.

5. **Quanto tempo dura a instalação num depósito de 100.000 litros?**
   A concrete tank of 100,000 L (approximately 50-80 m² internal surface area) typically
   takes 3-5 days for preparation and 2-3 days for membrane installation — total 5-8 working
   days including penetration details and quality testing. The tank is out of service for this
   period plus 72 hours for the water fill test. Membriko programmes work to minimise service
   interruption, and where a backup supply can be arranged, installation is planned accordingly.

6. **O EPDM funciona em depósitos metálicos (aço ou GRP)?**
   Yes. EPDM adheres to steel (with appropriate primer and immersion-rated adhesive) and to
   GRP panel inner surfaces. For steel tanks, EPDM provides complete separation of water from
   the metal substrate, preventing corrosion and contamination. For GRP sectional tanks with
   deteriorated joint seals, a continuous EPDM inner liner eliminates the joint issue entirely.

7. **Qual a garantia para trabalhos em depósitos de água?**
   Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty for all EPDM tank lining work. This
   covers the watertightness of the installed membrane and the integrity of all seams and
   penetration details. The warranty is supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product
   warranty and to the 5-year statutory liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code
   (Art. 1225).

8. **É necessário esvaziar completamente o depósito para instalar o EPDM?**
   Yes, for full-surface bonded installation the tank must be completely emptied and the
   surfaces must be dry and clean. For very large municipal reservatórios where a complete
   shutdown would interrupt supply, Membriko can discuss phased installation in sections if
   the tank design permits it, or coordinate timing with planned maintenance shutdowns.
   Emergency underwater temporary repairs with EPDM patch material are possible but permanent
   installation requires dry conditions.
