# Water Tank Lining with EPDM Membrane

## Water Storage in Portugal and the Persistent Problem of Leakage

Water storage infrastructure underpins a remarkable range of activities across Portugal.
Municipal service reservoirs supply towns and villages from the Minho to the Algarve. On-farm
concrete tanks hold the irrigation water that carries Alentejo olive groves and vineyards through
the summer months when rivers run low or dry entirely. Industrial plants in Sines, Estarreja and
along the Tagus Valley store process water in tanks that must remain watertight under continuous
service and occasional aggressive chemistry. Fire water tanks, required by Portuguese fire safety
legislation in industrial and high-risk buildings, must hold water reliably for years without
circulation. Rainwater harvesting cisterns under rural properties collect what falls in winter for
use in summer.

These structures share a common vulnerability: unlined concrete is not watertight. Reinforced
concrete is an excellent structural material, and Portuguese engineers have built long-lasting
tanks from it for over a century. But concrete is inherently porous, and it shrinks as it cures,
producing hairline cracks that are entirely normal from a structural standpoint yet allow water to
seep away steadily. A crack of 0.2 millimetres — well within the limits accepted by structural
codes for reinforced concrete water-retaining structures — can permit losses of 50 to 100 litres
per day per linear metre of crack length. In a large agricultural tank or a municipal service
reservoir with decades of thermal cycling behind it, such losses add up to a meaningful fraction
of stored volume.

Conventional remedies — bituminous coatings, epoxy paints, cementitious tanking products —
address the symptoms without solving the underlying mismatch: rigid coatings applied to a
structure that moves. Every crack that forms in the concrete after application propagates straight
through the brittle film. Every coating cycle means another shutdown, another round of surface
preparation, another capital expenditure, another 7 to 15 years before the same problem returns.

Membriko, based in Pombal in central Portugal, offers a different answer. EPDM rubber membrane —
the same elastomeric technology used to waterproof roofs for over five decades — is the only
single-installation, 50-plus-year solution for concrete, steel and underground water tanks. This
page explains the technical case with the clarity that engineers, facility managers and water
utility professionals deserve.

## Why EPDM is the Correct Material for Water Tank Lining

### The Elastomer Argument

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic rubber whose polymer backbone consists
exclusively of saturated carbon-carbon bonds. This molecular structure has two consequences that
make it uniquely suited to water tank lining.

First, it is chemically inert to water, dissolved minerals, disinfectant chemicals and the
spectrum of biological compounds that accumulate in stored water. There are no reactive sites in
the EPDM main chain for oxidising agents to attack. The membrane does not degrade, stiffen or
become brittle through water contact — it remains elastomeric for its entire service life.

Second, it elongates. Pool-grade and tank-grade EPDM achieves at least 400 per cent elongation
at break. In practical terms, a concrete crack of 0.3 millimetres beneath a 1.5 mm EPDM membrane
induces a local tensile strain in the membrane of approximately 0.2 per cent — a small fraction
of the material's elastic capacity. The membrane stretches to accommodate the crack without
rupture, without water ingress, and without any degradation of the surrounding sealed area.
Future crack growth is similarly accommodated. This is the property that no rigid coating system
can replicate, and it is the property that determines whether a tank lining lasts one decade
or five.

### Freedom from Plasticisers

For potable water applications, EPDM's absence of plasticisers is the defining property. Flexible
PVC liners and flexible PVC pipe products achieve their pliability through the addition of 20 to
40 per cent by weight of plasticiser compounds — typically phthalates or adipates. These compounds
are not chemically bonded to the PVC matrix; they are blended into it and migrate progressively
into any water in contact with the material, particularly at elevated temperatures. EPDM contains
no plasticisers of any kind. Its flexibility is intrinsic to the vulcanised rubber network — a
permanent three-dimensional crosslink structure that neither leaches into stored water nor
diminishes over time.

### Performance Properties for Tank Applications

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard water storage) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (industrial / deep tanks) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 20 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |
| Hydrostatic watertightness | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 (Method B) |
| Water absorption | < 1% by mass | ASTM D471 |
| pH resistance | 4.0 to 12.0 | — |
| Service temperature (immersion) | -45°C to +80°C | — |
| Dimensional stability | < 1% | EN 1107-2 |
| Potable water certification | WRAS (BS 6920) / NSF 61 / ACS | — |
| Projected service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ/Arrhenius |

Membriko specifies immersion-grade EPDM — formulated and certified specifically for permanent
water contact — for every tank lining project. Standard roofing-grade membrane is never used in
water storage applications.

## Tank Types — Concrete, Steel, Underground and Sectional

### Concrete Tanks

Reinforced concrete is Portugal's dominant tank construction material across all scales, from
10,000-litre rural cisterns to multi-million-litre municipal service reservoirs. The concrete
structure is typically long-lived, but the waterproofing challenge is real and consistent.

Three degradation mechanisms affect concrete tanks in Portuguese conditions. Shrinkage cracking
occurs as concrete cures — in thin-walled tanks (100 to 200 mm), through-cracks of 0.1 to
0.5 mm are structurally acceptable but hydraulically significant. Carbonation — the reaction
of atmospheric carbon dioxide with calcium hydroxide in the cement paste — advances progressively
from the exposed surface; in coastal and humid inland conditions, it can reach reinforcement in
20 to 30 years in thin concrete sections, initiating corrosion and expansive cracking. Thermal
cycling in outdoor tanks subjects concrete to daily temperature swings of 10 to 25°C in summer
and seasonal swings of 30 to 40°C, creating progressive fatigue cracking in unprotected sections.

Membriko addresses all three mechanisms with a single EPDM installation. The membrane bridges
existing cracks, accommodates future crack growth, and protects the concrete surface from
carbonation by limiting carbon dioxide access to the inner face.

### Steel Tanks

Above-ground and buried steel tanks appear across Portuguese industry and agriculture —
particularly in fire water storage, where above-ground steel panel tanks are the standard
specification in industrial parks, and in agricultural contexts where the speed of installation
is valued. Unlined steel corrodes in contact with water; the corrosion products discolour and
contaminate stored water, and progressive pitting eventually penetrates the tank wall.

Membriko's EPDM lining completely isolates the stored water from the metal substrate, eliminating
both the corrosion mechanism and the contamination pathway. For steel tanks, the membrane is
installed with a primer compatible with both the steel surface and the immersion-grade contact
adhesive, and is mechanically anchored at the top perimeter with stainless steel clamping profiles.
The result is a tank that can remain in service without internal corrosion protection maintenance
for the full 50-plus-year service life of the EPDM.

### Underground Tanks

Underground tanks present the most technically demanding installation conditions. Three challenges
distinguish them from above-ground work.

Back-pressure: when an underground tank is emptied for maintenance or inspection, groundwater
above the tank base level exerts upward hydrostatic pressure on the floor slab and inward
pressure on the walls. A loose-laid or partially bonded liner will blister and lift under this
pressure. Membriko installs EPDM in fully bonded systems that transfer back-pressure uniformly
across the adhesive bond to the substrate — the membrane cannot lift because it is anchored
across its entire surface area.

Confined space: any work inside a closed underground tank falls under Portuguese and EU confined
space legislation. Membriko's installation teams are trained and equipped for confined space
entry, carrying gas detection instruments, forced ventilation equipment and rescue harnesses on
every underground tank project.

Substrate moisture: underground tank walls are frequently damp even after draining. Membriko
uses immersion-grade contact adhesives with demonstrated adhesion on damp concrete surfaces,
and coordinates forced ventilation and drying protocols where the substrate moisture exceeds
application limits.

### Sectional and GRP Tanks

Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) sectional tanks — bolted-panel cold water storage vessels —
are found in commercial buildings, hotel plant rooms and industrial facilities across Portugal,
commonly used as break tanks, cold water header tanks and fire water storage. After 15 to 25
years of service, GRP panel surfaces develop gel coat crazing, and the rubber or elastomeric
gaskets sealing panel joints deteriorate and allow water to bypass.

Membriko installs a continuous EPDM inner liner in GRP sectional tanks, covering all internal
surfaces — floor panels, wall panels and the transitions between them — with a single seamless
system. This eliminates the joint sealing problem entirely and provides 50 years of further
service life from a tank structure that would otherwise require replacement.

---

## EPDM Lining for Existing Tanks — Rehabilitation Without Demolition

The majority of Membriko's water tank projects involve rehabilitation of existing structures
with failing coatings, not new-build lining. This distinction shapes everything: the
assessment approach, the preparation work, the installation sequence, and the economic case
for the client.

### The Rehabilitation Argument

A concrete tank in structurally sound condition with failed waterproofing is an asset worth
rehabilitating, not demolishing. Demolition and reconstruction of a reinforced concrete tank
typically costs three to five times the cost of EPDM rehabilitation, removes the asset from
service for months rather than days, generates significant demolition waste, and replaces
something that did not need replacing — the structure itself. Membriko proposes rehabilitation
as the primary option wherever the concrete structure is structurally adequate, and it is the
correct answer in the overwhelming majority of cases Membriko encounters.

### What Membriko Can Line Over

**Bare concrete:** the most common scenario in rehabilitation. The concrete is cleaned,
cracks are repaired with flexible epoxy or polyurethane injection mortar, sharp edges are
ground down, and the membrane is installed over the prepared surface with immersion-grade
contact adhesive.

**Existing epoxy coating:** if the epoxy is well-bonded to the concrete and shows no signs
of delamination, Membriko installs EPDM directly over it after light mechanical abrasion to
create a keyed surface. Where the epoxy is delaminating, it is removed by mechanical means
before EPDM installation.

**Bituminous coating:** older bituminous coatings in Portuguese municipal tanks — common in
infrastructure built before 1990 — are assessed for adhesion and stability. Stable, well-bonded
bituminous coatings can serve as a base for EPDM. Delaminating or softened bitumen is removed.

**Cementitious renders and tanking mortars:** compatible as a base for EPDM provided they are
sound and fully bonded to the substrate.

### What Must Be Addressed Before Installation

Active leaks must be stopped with hydro-expanding polyurethane grout before the membrane is
installed. Delaminating surface material must be mechanically removed. Biological contamination
— algae, biofilm and calcareous deposits — must be treated with high-pressure jetting and sodium
hypochlorite before installation. Sharp edges and protrusions that would concentrate stress on
the membrane must be ground flush.

Membriko diagnoses all of these conditions during the initial technical inspection and informs
the client clearly about what preparatory work is required before membrane installation. Nothing
discovered during preparation should come as a surprise on site.

---

## Installation Process (8 Steps)

Membriko follows a systematic, documented installation process for every tank project. The
process is adapted to tank-specific conditions — confined space access, higher penetration
density, back-pressure considerations — rather than being a transplant of the pool or roof
installation method.

### Step 1: Initial Technical Inspection

Membriko carries out a free technical inspection before any quotation is issued. This inspection
covers the internal geometry of the tank (length, width, height, internal columns, baffles, ramps
and access ladders), the condition of the concrete or metal substrate, the type and condition of
any existing coating, the inventory and position of all penetrations (inlet pipes, draw-off pipes
at different levels, overflow connections, sump drains, level probe wells, ventilation openings),
and the access conditions including manhole or hatch dimensions, confined space classification,
and availability of power and water on site.

The inspection report is the technical foundation for the project proposal. Membriko does not
issue standard quotations for water tanks — every proposal is based on site-specific data.

### Step 2: Membrane Layout and Specification

The membrane cutting layout is planned from the precise survey data, minimising the number
of seams and positioning them away from zones of maximum hydrostatic stress. The specification
covers membrane thickness (1.5 mm standard, 2.0 mm for industrial or deep tanks), the adhesive
system (matched to the substrate type and service conditions), and the penetration detail type
for each pipe and fitting.

### Step 3: Tank Emptying and Decontamination

The tank is completely emptied and Membriko carries out internal cleaning under confined space
entry procedures: removal of sediment, biological fouling and calcareous deposits; high-pressure
water jetting (80 to 150 bar); sodium hypochlorite treatment for biological contamination;
forced ventilation for drying and air quality management.

### Step 4: Surface Preparation

Surface preparation is the step that most determines the long-term performance of the installed
system. Membriko invests the time and equipment this step demands:
- Crack repair with epoxy or polyurethane injection mortar
- Mechanical removal of delaminated coatings by disc grinding or scarification
- Levelling of uneven surfaces with high-adhesion cementitious repair mortar
- Grinding of all sharp edges, protrusions and formwork tie holes
- Final adhesion verification by pull-off test on the prepared substrate

### Step 5: EPDM Membrane Installation

Installation begins at the tank floor with the largest membrane panel. The fully bonded system
uses immersion-grade contact adhesive applied to both the substrate and the membrane underside.
Flash time is observed before contact to ensure proper adhesive film development. The membrane
is pressed firmly with a silicone roller across the entire surface to achieve full contact without
air pockets.

Wall panels follow, with a 100 mm overlap onto the floor membrane and seaming with 150 mm wide
QuickSeam tape. In tanks taller than three metres, wall panels are installed in horizontal bands
with temporary restraint strips to prevent membrane slippage before adhesive cure.

### Step 6: Penetration Details

Every pipe penetration receives a purpose-made watertight detail. Circular pipe penetrations are
fitted with pre-formed EPDM pipe collars combining internal and external EPDM flanges bonded
to the membrane with QuickSeam adhesive and primer, and mechanically compressed with stainless
steel AISI 316 bolted flanges. Larger diameter penetrations use compression flanges that form
a mechanical seal by pressing the membrane between two metal faces. Mastic sealants are used
only as a weather finish on external details — they are never the primary watertight barrier.

### Step 7: Inspection and Watertightness Test

After installation, Membriko carries out a systematic visual inspection of all seams using a
metal probe — any point where the probe penetrates indicates an incomplete bond, and the seam
is reworked. A photographic record is made of all critical details: seams, penetrations, internal
corners, perimeter terminations. The tank is then filled with clean water to normal operating
level and the level is monitored against a fixed datum for a minimum of 72 hours. A level drop
of more than five millimetres per day, corrected for temperature-driven density change, triggers
a leak investigation. For potable water tanks, a water quality test (turbidity, colour, odour,
basic chemical analysis) is conducted before the tank is returned to potable supply service.

### Step 8: Handover, Documentation and Warranty

At project completion, Membriko delivers a 20-year installation warranty certificate, a quality
inspection report with a full as-built photographic record, the EPDM product certification
documentation (WRAS/NSF 61 copies), water quality test results for potable water projects, and
a maintenance guide with recommended inspection intervals.

## Potable Water Compliance — WRAS, NSF 61 and Portuguese Regulation

Water tank lining for potable water contact is a regulated activity, not merely a technical
preference. Any compound that migrates from a tank liner into drinking water reaches the consumer.
The regulatory and certification framework exists to prevent this, and compliance with it is both
a legal obligation and an expression of professional responsibility.

### WRAS (BS 6920) — The International Reference

The Water Regulations Advisory Scheme approval under BS 6920 is the most internationally
recognised certification for materials in contact with potable water. The BS 6920 test protocol
evaluates migration under specified temperature and contact time conditions, assessing odour,
taste and appearance change, and the extraction of metals and organic compounds from the material
into water. WRAS-approved EPDM has demonstrated no detectable odour or taste contribution,
no colour impartation, no metals above WHO guideline values, and no sulphur compounds, antioxidant
residues or carbon black extractables above permitted limits.

WRAS approval is routinely required by UK water authorities and is specified by reference in
international infrastructure projects financed by the European Investment Bank and the World Bank.
Membriko specifies WRAS-certified EPDM for all potable water tank projects as standard.

### NSF/ANSI 61 — The North American and International Standard

NSF Standard 61 from NSF International covers drinking water system components including tank
liners, pipe gaskets and valve seals. NSF 61 testing evaluates migration at both ambient
temperature (23°C) and elevated temperature (60°C), using standardised water formulations that
simulate aggressive potable water chemistry. NSF 61 certified EPDM is the specification standard
for North American drinking water infrastructure and is increasingly referenced in international
projects across Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

### Portuguese Regulatory Framework

Portugal transposed the European Drinking Water Directive (2020/2184) through national legislation
requiring that materials in contact with drinking water do not compromise water quality or human
health. ERSAR — the Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos — regulates the water
and sanitation services sector and sets infrastructure quality requirements for utilities.
WRAS, NSF 61 or ACS (the French equivalent) certification is the accepted demonstration of
compliance for tank lining materials. Membriko provides the complete certification documentation
package — product certification copies, migration test data, CE declaration of performance under
EN 13956, and post-commissioning water quality test results — for every potable water tank project.

## EPDM vs Epoxy Coatings, Polyurea and PVC — An Honest Comparison

Engineers and procurement managers who specify tank rehabilitation frequently encounter epoxy
and polyurea as alternative options. These are legitimate systems in specific conditions. Membriko
presents the comparison with the objectivity that clients who will live with the results deserve.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Epoxy Coating | Polyurea Spray | Unplasticised PVC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | 0-2% | 20-50% | 2-5% |
| Crack bridging | Excellent (up to 5 mm) | None | Limited (< 1 mm) | None |
| Potable water certification | WRAS / NSF 61 / ACS | Grade-specific | Grade-specific | Available |
| Service life | 50+ years | 7-15 years | 15-25 years | 20-30 years |
| Recoating requirement | None | Every 7-15 years | Every 15-25 years | None |
| Application on damp surfaces | Yes (damp-tolerant adhesive) | No (strict moisture limits) | Limited | No |
| Repair method | Patch bonding | Grind and recoat | Specialist spray repair | Heat welding |
| 30-year lifecycle cost index | 100 | 200 (2 recoatings) | 150 | 120 |

An honest qualification from Membriko: for tanks with crack-free, structurally sound concrete
in a controlled humidity environment, high-build epoxy is a technically sound solution at a
lower initial unit cost. Polyurea spray has genuine advantages in speed for very large-area civil
tanks where specialist plural-component equipment is mobilised. Membriko recommends EPDM where
crack bridging is required, where a 50-year lifecycle without recoating is the design objective,
or where the total installed cost over the asset's service life is the governing criterion.

## Structural Integration — Large Tanks and Complex Geometries

### Large Municipal Reservoirs

Municipal service reservoirs in Portugal typically have internal heights of three to six metres.
Installing EPDM on vertical walls of this height requires procedural adaptations that Membriko
has developed through direct project experience.

Wall panels are installed in horizontal bands working from the base upward, with temporary
horizontal restraint strips at each band boundary to support the weight of the membrane during
adhesive cure. Without restraint, the membrane would slip before the adhesive has developed full
bond strength. Mobile internal scaffolding provides safe working access at height and allows
systematic quality control of each band as it is completed.

For compartmented reservoirs — common in municipal systems where one chamber must remain in
service while another is rehabilitated — Membriko plans the installation sequence to maintain
partial supply throughout the works, coordinating with the utility's operational team on filling
and draw-off schedules.

### Tanks with Internal Columns and Baffles

Large-span reservoir roofs are typically supported by internal concrete columns. Membriko wraps
these columns with EPDM using pre-formed corner transition pieces that create a continuous
membrane surface from the floor to the column sides without transverse seams across zones of
concentrated hydrostatic loading.

### Floating Covers on Open Tanks

Agricultural reservoirs in the Alentejo and Ribatejo are frequently open-topped, exposing the
stored water to evaporation and sunlight. Membriko can supply and install floating EPDM covers
integrated with the tank lining — the liner and the floating cover are joined at the tank perimeter
to form a complete system. In the Alentejo, where summer evaporation from open reservoirs can
represent five to ten per cent of stored volume per month, a floating EPDM cover recovers its
cost within a single irrigation season on a large agricultural tank.

### Overflow and Weir Details

Every water tank has an overflow arrangement — typically a concrete weir at a defined level.
Membriko takes the EPDM liner over the weir crest with a stainless steel termination bar
mechanically anchored to the concrete. The downstream overflow channel can also be lined with
EPDM, creating a continuous containment system that prevents erosion of the overflow channel
base under continuous flow conditions.

## Maintenance and Inspection

A EPDM-lined tank requires no liner-specific maintenance beyond the normal cleaning and inspection
programme that any water storage tank requires. This is one of the practical advantages that
accumulated cost-of-ownership analysis consistently reveals in favour of EPDM over coating systems
requiring periodic reapplication.

### Recommended Inspection Programme

Membriko recommends an annual visual inspection of the membrane surface, conducted during the
routine annual tank clean. The inspection should cover the high-waterline zone (the area of
maximum UV exposure and most frequent wetting-and-drying cycling), all penetration details,
and the floor-to-wall junction seams. Any sign of membrane lifting, separation or mechanical
damage should be reported to Membriko for assessment.

For municipal and industrial tanks, Membriko offers a five-yearly technical inspection service
with a written photographic report and integrity assessment of seams and penetration details.

### Cleaning Compatibility

EPDM is compatible with all cleaning agents used in Portuguese water tank maintenance practice:
sodium hypochlorite solutions up to 200 ppm, dilute citric acid or dilute hydrochloric acid
for limescale removal (pH must remain above 4.0), high-pressure water jetting up to 150 bar,
and nylon brush scrubbing. Steel wire brushing or abrasive mechanical cleaning equipment that
could score the membrane surface should be avoided.

### Repair Procedures

If the membrane sustains a point puncture or tear from maintenance equipment or access ladder
contact, Membriko carries out repair as follows. Permanent repair: the tank is drained in the
affected zone, the damaged area is cleaned and dried, and an EPDM repair patch of matching
thickness and width is bonded with QuickSeam primer and tape under firm roller pressure. A
single-point repair takes two to four hours, plus tank refilling time. Emergency temporary
repair: where immediate draining is not possible, Membriko can apply a temporary underwater
adhesive repair to stem water loss until a planned shutdown permits permanent reinstatement.

## Portuguese Water Regulations and Standards

### Drinking Water — Directive 2020/2184 and Decreto-Lei 152/2017

Portugal has transposed the recast European Drinking Water Directive (2020/2184) through
national legislation. Materials in contact with potable water must not deteriorate water quality
or pose a risk to human health. ERSAR monitors compliance across the water and sanitation
services sector. WRAS (BS 6920), NSF 61 or the ACS are the accepted certification routes for
demonstrating that a tank lining material meets the non-contamination requirement.

Membriko provides the complete certification documentation package for every potable water
tank project, including product certification copies, migration test data, the CE declaration
of performance under EN 13956, and post-commissioning water quality test results.

### Fire Water Storage — SCIE Legislation

Portuguese fire safety legislation (Decreto-Lei 220/2008 on the legal framework for fire safety
in buildings — SCIE — and Portaria 1532/2008 on the Technical Regulation for Fire Safety
in Buildings) requires dedicated fire water storage in all buildings classified at Risk Category
3 or above. Storage volumes are determined by the fire safety designer based on the building
use type and risk classification, and typically range from 50,000 to 500,000 litres.

Fire water is stored without circulation for extended periods — potentially years — and must
remain clean enough to pass through pump seals, hose reel valves and sprinkler heads without
causing equipment damage. EPDM's absence of plasticisers and extractable compounds makes it
the correct choice for fire water tank lining. Membriko provides the technical documentation
required by SCIE designers and licensing authorities: product specification, CE declaration and
water quality test results after tank commissioning.

### Relevant Technical Standards

**EN 13956:** Flexible sheets for waterproofing — synthetic polymer sheets; the base product
standard for EPDM membranes; CE marking is mandatory.
**EN 1928 (Method B):** Watertightness under hydrostatic pressure — the standard pass/fail
test for tank waterproofing membranes.
**EN 12311-2:** Mechanical properties — tensile strength and elongation for flexible waterproofing
sheets.
**BS 6920 (WRAS):** Suitability of non-metallic products for use in contact with water intended
for human consumption.
**NSF/ANSI 61:** Drinking water system components — health effects.

## Fire Water Storage Tanks

Fire water tanks represent a specific and regulated market segment that Membriko works in
regularly across industrial Portugal. The SCIE framework is unambiguous: buildings of the risk
categories it covers must have an independently stored reserve of water — not drawn from the
mains supply — that can sustain fire fighting operations for the design duration.

Membriko has installed EPDM in fire water tanks of several configurations that appear commonly
across Portuguese industrial parks and commercial buildings.

Buried concrete tanks beneath building aprons or external hardstanding are the most common
configuration in industrial settings. The tank is cast in reinforced concrete, often at the
same time as the building foundations, and is subsequently accessed only through manholes.
Membriko's confined space installation procedure is standard for these projects.

Above-ground steel panel tanks in plant rooms or external tank compounds are common in commercial
buildings. EPDM lining protects the steel from internal corrosion and prevents the contamination
of stored water by iron oxides, which would cause pump seal wear and valve obstruction over time.

GRP sectional tanks installed in plant rooms develop joint and gel coat deterioration over their
service life. Membriko's continuous EPDM inner liner — installed through the access hatches of
the existing tank — restores full watertightness without tank replacement, at a fraction of the
replacement cost.

For all fire water tank projects, Membriko provides the full documentation package required for
SCIE compliance sign-off: product specification with CE declaration, WRAS or NSF 61 certification,
water quality test report after commissioning, and the Membriko 20-year installation warranty.

## Industrial Water Tanks

Portugal's industrial sector presents water tank lining requirements that go beyond the standard
potable water or fire water specification. Process water in food and beverage production — wine
estates, olive oil cooperatives, cork processing facilities — must be stored in tanks that do not
introduce off-flavours, off-odours or any compound that could affect product quality.

Chemical sector plants at Sines, Estarreja and Barreiro handle process water at pH conditions
and temperatures that would challenge many coating systems. EPDM's resistance range of pH 4 to
12 and service temperature to 80°C under immersion covers the large majority of industrial
process water applications in Portugal's principal industrial sectors. For process water with
extreme acidity (pH below 4), strong oxidising chemistry, or specific organic solvents, Membriko
consults the membrane manufacturer's published chemical resistance data before confirming the
specification — a step that protects the client from an inappropriate recommendation and the
membrane from exposure it was not designed for.

Pharmaceutical facilities in the Cantanhede bioscience cluster and Vigo-facing plants in the
north require clean room-compatible materials and documentation standards. Membriko's documentation
package — product certification, installation record, as-built photography and water quality
test — meets the traceability requirements of pharmaceutical GMP environments.

Installation in operating industrial facilities requires scheduling coordination that Membriko
treats as a core project management task. Every industrial tank project receives a specific
programme detailing shutdown dates, access requirements, confined space procedures and
recommissioning sequence — produced before contract award, not improvised on site.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can an old concrete tank be relined without demolition?**

In the overwhelming majority of cases, yes. A concrete tank that is structurally sound but whose
waterproofing coating has failed is an asset worth rehabilitating. Demolition costs three to five
times more than EPDM rehabilitation, takes the tank out of service for months rather than days,
and replaces a concrete structure that had decades of useful life remaining. Membriko assesses
structural adequacy during the initial technical inspection and is clear with clients about the
rare cases where the structure itself is the problem.

**Is EPDM certified for drinking water contact?**

Yes. Membriko specifies WRAS (BS 6920) and/or NSF/ANSI 61 certified EPDM for all potable water
applications. These certifications demonstrate through standardised testing that the membrane
introduces no plasticisers, no heavy metals and no organic compounds into stored water above
health-based thresholds. Full certification documentation is included in the project handover
package.

**What is the difference between tank-grade and roofing-grade EPDM?**

The base polymer chemistry is identical. The differences are the antioxidant package (formulated
for continuous water immersion rather than atmospheric exposure), the potable water certifications
(WRAS/NSF 61 are not required for roofing membranes), and the adhesive system (rated for
permanent immersion at the service temperature). Membriko specifies immersion-grade EPDM for
every water storage application — standard roofing membrane is not used in water contact situations.

**Will EPDM withstand the hydrostatic pressure in a 4-metre-deep tank?**

Yes. A four-metre water column generates approximately 40 kPa of hydrostatic pressure. The EPDM
membrane is certified to 60 kPa by EN 1928 (Method B). The fully bonded installation method
distributes this pressure across the adhesive bond between the membrane and the substrate — the
membrane is not unsupported at any point. Tanks up to 8 to 10 metres internal depth are within
the hydrostatic capacity of correctly installed EPDM.

**How long does installation take in a 100,000-litre tank?**

A concrete tank of 100,000 litres typically has an internal surface area of 50 to 80 square
metres. Preparation takes two to three working days; membrane installation, penetration details
and seam quality checks take a further two to three days. The 72-hour watertightness monitoring
period follows. Total service interruption is seven to ten working days. Membriko produces a
programme before contract award so that the client can arrange alternative supply if needed
during the shutdown period.

**Does EPDM work in steel or GRP tanks?**

Yes. EPDM adheres to primed steel surfaces using immersion-rated contact adhesive, and bonds
to the inner surfaces of GRP sectional tanks. For steel tanks, the membrane provides complete
separation of stored water from the metal substrate, eliminating internal corrosion and the
resulting water contamination. For GRP sectional tanks with degraded joint gaskets, a continuous
EPDM inner membrane eliminates the joint problem entirely and provides 50 years of further
service life from the existing tank structure.

**What warranty does Membriko provide on water tank lining?**

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty covering the watertightness of the installed
membrane and the integrity of all seams and penetration details. This warranty is additional to
the membrane manufacturer's product warranty and to the five-year statutory liability period
for construction defects under the Portuguese Civil Code (Article 1225). The warranty certificate
is delivered together with the as-built photographic record and project documentation at
project handover.

**Does the tank need to be completely empty for EPDM installation?**

Yes, for the fully bonded installation method the tank must be completely emptied and surfaces
must be dry and clean. For large municipal reservoirs where a full shutdown would interrupt
supply, Membriko can discuss phased installation by compartment if the reservoir design permits
it, coordinating with the utility's planned maintenance windows. Temporary underwater repairs
using immersion-grade EPDM adhesive are possible to control a leak before a full shutdown is
arranged, but permanent installation always requires dry surface conditions.
