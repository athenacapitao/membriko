# Retention Basins — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Retention basins are the crossroads between civil infrastructure engineering, urban planning
regulation and ecological function. The audience for this page is far more technically demanding
than most of Membriko's other application pages — it includes civil engineers and hydraulic
designers specifying materials for public infrastructure, municipal water engineers, environmental
consultants preparing licensing applications, and private developers complying with planning
conditions.

The persuasion architecture must therefore operate on two levels simultaneously:

1. **Technical credibility**: speak the language of hydrology, geomembrane engineering and
   Portuguese water law; demonstrate that Membriko understands the hydraulic design context, not
   just the membrane installation
2. **Problem-solution clarity**: the core narrative is that clay liners crack in Portuguese summers,
   HDPE wrinkles and creates seam failures, and EPDM does neither — a simple message that
   resonates with anyone who has maintained an ageing clay-lined basin

The secondary audience — private developers, industrial operators and agricultural businesses —
cares less about regulatory detail and more about cost of ownership, installation speed and
long-term performance without ongoing maintenance. The page structure accommodates both audiences
by beginning with the broad stormwater management context, progressing through technical depth,
and maintaining clear application-specific subsections.

Environmental and ecological co-benefits (wetland creation, water quality improvement) provide
a third narrative thread relevant to projects seeking environmental licensing advantages or EIA
(Estudo de Impacte Ambiental) approval support.

## Section 1: Introduction — Stormwater Management in Portugal

**Purpose:** Establish the stormwater management context and the problem that retention basins
solve, anchoring in Portuguese climate and regulatory reality.

**Content:**
- Opening with Portugal's changing precipitation pattern: increasingly intense and episodic
  rainfall events driven by climate change, interspersed with extended dry periods; the dual
  challenge of flood management and summer drought
- The role of retention basins in urban and peri-urban drainage: decoupling development from
  the natural catchment response; compensating for lost natural floodplain storage; meeting
  APA and municipal planning requirements
- The lining problem: most Portuguese retention basins rely on clay or compacted earth — materials
  that crack predictably during the dry months and fail silently until the next major storm
  event reveals the storage loss
- Membriko's answer: EPDM geomembrane lining that maintains hydraulic performance across
  unlimited wet-dry cycles, for a documented 50+ year service life, with a 20-year installation
  warranty
- Stat block: 50+ years / 1.0-1.5 mm thickness / unlimited wet-dry cycles / 20-year Membriko
  warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação de Projeto"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Retention Basins

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the material science case for EPDM over clay, HDPE and
concrete in the specific retention basin environment.

**Content:**
- The three dominant failure modes of non-EPDM basin liners:
  1. Clay desiccation cracking during Portuguese summer dry periods (July-September)
  2. HDPE thermal wrinkling and seam fatigue under seasonal temperature cycling
  3. Concrete cracking and joint failure under differential settlement
- Why EPDM addresses all three: elastic recovery, UV and desiccation resistance, seamless
  large-panel geometry
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness | 1.0 mm (light duty) / 1.5 mm (standard) | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | UV resistance | No degradation at 2,000 hrs | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Root resistance | Pass | EN 13948 |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |
  | Max panel width | 15.25 m | — |
- Key standard: EN 13361 — EPDM as flexible geomembrane for water storage applications

## Section 3: Basin Types and EPDM Application

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko understands the full typology of retention and detention
structures, and that EPDM is the correct solution for each.

**Content:** Four basin type cards.

**Wet Retention Basins (Bacias de Retenção Húmidas)**
- Permanent water body; continuous hydrostatic pressure; aquatic vegetation; wetland habitat
- EPDM role: permanent liner maintaining water level; compatible with aquatic plant colonisation;
  chemically inert in the aquatic ecosystem

**Dry Detention Basins (Bacias de Detenção Secas)**
- Normally dry; most severe wet-dry cycling; full UV exposure between events; erosion risk on
  bare slopes
- EPDM role: the only liner material that withstands unlimited wet-dry cycling without cracking;
  UV-stable between events

**Infiltration Basins (Bacias de Infiltração)**
- Designed for managed groundwater recharge; partially or selectively lined; pre-treatment
  cells upstream of the infiltration zone
- EPDM role: bank lining only (directing seepage downward); lining of pre-treatment cells
  and settling zones

**Compensatory Retention Basins (Bacias de Compensação)**
- Regulatory requirement under Portuguese urban development licensing; must demonstrably
  replace lost floodplain storage; audited by APA/municipal water authorities
- EPDM role: guaranteed hydraulic performance; 50-year service life meets public infrastructure
  design life requirements; documentation package supports regulatory submission

---

## Section 4: Stormwater Regulations in Portugal

**Purpose:** Establish regulatory authority and provide genuine value to civil engineers and
municipal planners seeking to understand the legislative framework.

**Content:**
- EU Floods Directive (2007/60/EC) and Portuguese transposition (Decreto-Lei 115/2010): Planos
  de Gestão dos Riscos de Inundação (PGRI) require municipalities to demonstrate flood risk
  management through structural and non-structural measures; retention basins are a primary
  structural measure
- Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005): national water law governing discharge to water bodies; stormwater
  retention basin discharge licensing under domínio hídrico
- APA licensing requirements: licenciamento de utilização do domínio hídrico for basin
  construction and operation; performance criteria and monitoring obligations
- Municipal PDM and RMUE requirements: planning conditions on new development for peak flow
  attenuation; typical requirement to demonstrate post-development Qpeak ≤ pre-development
  Qpeak for 10-year and 100-year return period events
- ENAAC 2020 and climate adaptation: national strategy recognising increased extreme precipitation
  and the need for expanded stormwater retention capacity
- RGEU drainage requirements for urban development

## Section 5: Installation Process (8 Steps)

**Purpose:** De-risk the specification decision by making the installation process transparent
and predictable for engineers unfamiliar with EPDM geomembrane systems.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Levantamento Topográfico e Estudo de Projeto** — Topographic survey of basin area; review
   of hydrological design; assessment of basin geometry, side slopes, inlet and outlet structure
   positions; soil investigation review (permeability, bearing capacity, slope stability)
2. **Dimensionamento da Membrana** — Calculation of membrane area, panel layout to minimise seams
   on basin floor (lowest stress zone); seam positions planned for upper slopes where settlement
   risk is lowest; selection of membrane thickness (1.0 mm light duty, 1.5 mm standard, 2.0 mm
   for heavy-duty applications)
3. **Preparação do Leito da Bacia** — Earthwork trimming and compaction of basin floor and side
   slopes to specified geometry; removal of sharp stones, roots and debris; installation of
   compacted sand or geotextile cushion layer on rocky or angular substrates
4. **Instalação da Geotêxtil de Protecção** — Geotextile underlay (200-400 g/m²) installed on
   prepared surface to protect EPDM from puncture by angular particles and to distribute
   concentrated loads; geotextile joints overlapped ≥ 500 mm
5. **Instalação da Membrana EPDM** — Membrane panels unrolled from the basin crest downward;
   panels lapped and adhered with EPDM contact adhesive; QuickSeam tape applied to all field
   seams; membrane weighted temporarily during installation to prevent wind displacement
6. **Detalhes Singulares: Entradas e Saídas** — Penetration details for inlet pipes, outlet
   structures, weirs and overflow channels; pre-formed EPDM collars and flanged connectors
   bonded to the main membrane with extended adhesive and tape overlaps; concrete structure
   connections via clamping bar and sealant
7. **Ancoragem Perimetral** — Anchor trench excavated at basin crest perimeter; membrane edge
   folded into trench (minimum 500 mm burial depth) and compacted fill placed over; or mechanical
   anchor bar fixed to concrete coping structure where provided; perimeter anchorage resists
   uplift from hydrostatic pressure during drawdown
8. **Inspeção e Documentação** — Visual inspection of all seams and penetrations; hydraulic fill
   test to designed water level; seam integrity verification; as-built photographic record and
   measurement; issue of Membriko 20-year warranty certificate and installation report for
   submission to licensing authority

## Section 6: Sizing and Hydrology

**Purpose:** Demonstrate Membriko's understanding of the hydraulic engineering context without
replacing the hydrologist; position Membriko as a specialist partner to the design team.

**Content:**
- Basin sizing fundamentals: the relationship between catchment area, impervious surface fraction,
  design storm return period (typically 2, 10 and 100-year for Portuguese PDM compliance), and
  required storage volume
- Typical sizing parameters for Portuguese conditions:
  - Runoff coefficient C: 0.7-0.9 for paved urban catchments; 0.1-0.3 for agricultural land
  - Design rainfall intensities: 10-year, 1-hour: 25-45 mm/h depending on region
    (highest in the NW coast; lowest in the Alentejo interior)
  - Required attenuation storage: typically 100-400 m³/ha of new impervious surface
- Membrane area calculation: basin floor area + side slopes at design geometry (typically 1:2
  to 1:3 H:V for stability); typical basin perimeter-to-area ratios
- Depth and liner implications: basin depth affects hydrostatic pressure on liner and required
  anchor trench dimensions; Membriko provides site-specific sizing assistance to design teams
- Note on geotechnical interface friction: ASTM D5321 testing confirms EPDM/geotextile interface
  friction angle ≥ 18° — adequate for slopes up to 1:2 H:V without additional anchoring

## Section 7: EPDM vs HDPE / Concrete / Clay

**Purpose:** Provide the comparative analysis that engineers need to justify EPDM selection
in a specification or procurement document.

**Content:** Comparison table with 8 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | Compacted Clay Liner | Concrete / Shotcrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 30-40 years | 15-30 years (desiccation) | 20-40 years (joint failure) |
| Desiccation resistance | Excellent — unaffected | Good | Poor — cracks in summer | Good |
| Thermal stability | Excellent — no wrinkling | Poor at high temps (wrinkles) | Good | Good |
| Seam count (large basin) | Low (15.25 m panels) | High (5-8 m panels) | N/A | High (joint count) |
| Installation plant required | Light — no welding equipment | Heavy — extrusion welders | Heavy — compaction plant | Heavy — concrete plant |
| Elasticity / crack bridging | Excellent — 400% elongation | Low — brittle post-yield | None | None |
| Root resistance | Excellent — EN 13948 | Good | Poor | Good |
| 50-year cost index | 100 | 135 (replacement at year 35) | 160 (repairs + reconstruction) | 120 (joint resealing cycles) |

## Section 8: Integration with Urban Landscape

**Purpose:** Address the common objection that EPDM-lined basins look industrial; demonstrate
that EPDM provides the ideal substrate for green and ecological basin design.

**Content:**
- Vegetated bank design: EPDM anchor at crest, grass/wildflower seed mix on upper banks above
  the EPDM edge; the membrane itself is typically covered with 200-300 mm of topsoil and
  planting on upper bank zones
- Aquatic vegetation establishment: shallow margins (0-0.3 m depth) planted with native emergent
  aquatics; EPDM provides a stable, non-toxic substrate for plant root establishment
- Recreational integration: some retention basins in urban parks double as recreational
  landscape features when dry — EPDM provides a clean, durable surface for this dual function
- Visual screening and aesthetic design: earthwork berm landscaping, tree planting and curved
  basin geometry integrate basins into urban green infrastructure
- Portuguese SuDS design guidance (LNEC/APA): aligned with national standards for
  multi-functional stormwater management assets

---

## Section 9: Environmental Benefits

**Purpose:** Provide the environmental and ecological co-benefits narrative relevant to
environmental licensing and sustainability reporting.

**Content:**
- Wetland habitat creation: EPDM-lined wet basins as constructed wetland habitats; biodiversity
  indices for retention pond wetland; native species establishment
- Water quality improvement: TSS removal (50-80%), nutrient uptake, thermal moderation of
  stormwater; no liner leachate contamination
- Groundwater protection: EPDM's near-zero permeability (effective k < 10⁻¹⁵ m/s) prevents
  pollutant migration from contaminated runoff to groundwater — a key benefit in industrial
  and transport infrastructure applications
- Carbon accounting: EPDM 50-year service life vs alternatives requiring earlier replacement;
  avoided carbon from reduced earthwork and reconstruction
- Portugal's climate adaptation commitments: ENAAC 2020, Roteiro para a Neutralidade Carbónica
  2050; retention basins with 50-year EPDM liners contribute to long-term adaptation
  infrastructure investment

## Section 11: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Quantify the low maintenance requirement — a key commercial argument for public
sector asset managers.

**Content:**
- Annual inspection: visual inspection of basin perimeter, anchor trench condition, inlet/outlet
  seals; inspect after significant storm events for debris accumulation
- Vegetation management: mowing or strimming of bank vegetation typically twice yearly;
  no specialist EPDM maintenance required in this process
- Sediment management: wet basins accumulate sediment over 10-25 years; desludging required
  (typically excavator or suction pump); EPDM provides a smooth, durable floor surface that
  facilitates desludging without membrane damage
- Repair procedure: EPDM puncture repair patches can be applied dry in drained condition;
  underwater temporary repairs possible in emergencies; typical repair time 2-4 hours
- What to avoid: tracked plant on the basin floor without protective matting; sharp stone
  tipping directly onto membrane; membrane exposure to petroleum-based contaminants
  (compatible with brief incidental contact but not prolonged immersion in hydrocarbons)
- Membriko maintenance inspection: offered at 5-year intervals for public sector clients;
  written inspection report for regulatory compliance and asset management documentation

---

## Section 12: Portuguese SuDS Frameworks

**Purpose:** Serve the growing group of urban planners, landscape architects and environmental
consultants working within SuDS design frameworks.

**Content:**
- SuDS principles in Portugal: the slow, spread, sink, store, clean hierarchy; retention basins
  as the "store" and "clean" components of the SuDS train
- APA / LNEC guidance on retention pond design: recommended basin geometry (length:width ratio
  ≥ 3:1 for effective plug flow; side slopes 1:2 to 1:3 for bank stability and vegetation
  establishment)
- Integration with upstream SuDS: bioretention cells and swales feeding into EPDM-lined retention
  basins; the Membriko membrane as the reliable containment layer in the integrated SuDS system
- Adoption in Portuguese urban masterplanning: examples of PDM provisions requiring SuDS-based
  stormwater management in Área Metropolitana de Lisboa and Porto metropolitan area developments
- EPDM's role in green and blue infrastructure: Plano Verde municipal strategies; blue-green
  corridors linking retention ponds with green space networks
- Reference to EU Urban Agenda for Adaptation and European Green Deal targets relevant to
  Portuguese municipal investment planning

## Section 13: Public vs Private Applications

**Purpose:** Address both the public sector engineer and the private developer/industrial client
with distinct value propositions.

**Content:**

**Public Sector Applications:**
- Municipal stormwater management: urban basin assets managed by Câmaras Municipais under SMAS
  (Serviços Municipalizados de Água e Saneamento) or private concessionaires
- Road drainage: retention basins for motorway runoff (AIP/IP network) under BRISA, Infraestruturas
  de Portugal management; EU co-funded infrastructure requiring 30-50 year design lives
- Public parks and recreational spaces: multi-functional retention ponds in urban green space
- School and public building drainage: campus stormwater management schemes
- Value proposition for public sector: 50-year service life aligns with public infrastructure
  accounting cycles; 20-year warranty reduces council risk; EN 13361 geomembrane compliance
  supports public procurement specifications

**Private Sector Applications:**
- Industrial parks and logistics platforms: large impervious surface runoff management;
  pollution prevention from first-flush contamination
- Agri-industrial facilities: process water and runoff management for olive oil, wine, fruit
  packing and livestock operations in the Alentejo and Ribatejo
- Golf courses: irrigation storage combined with stormwater management function (Algarve,
  Comporta, Troia peninsula)
- Residential and commercial development: planning condition compliance for stormwater
  attenuation as condition of alvará de construção
- Quarrying and mining: settling ponds and process water retention
- Value proposition for private sector: planning condition compliance at lowest lifecycle cost;
  minimal ongoing maintenance burden; Membriko documentation package supports licensing submission

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales technical queries from engineers
and project managers.

1. **Que espessura de membrana EPDM é recomendada para uma bacia de retenção municipal?**
   The standard specification for municipal retention basins is 1.5 mm EPDM, compliant with
   EN 13361. For basins subject to heavy plant access during desludging operations, or where
   coarse angular stone underlies the membrane, 2.0 mm is recommended. For small private
   agricultural ponds and low-traffic applications, 1.0 mm may be appropriate. Membriko provides
   thickness recommendations as part of the project design review process.

2. **O EPDM resiste à secagem completa em verões portugueses? A argila fissurou na nossa bacia.**
   This is EPDM's single most important advantage over clay in the Portuguese context. EPDM is
   an elastomeric rubber that does not contain water and therefore cannot desiccate or crack
   during dry periods. A clay liner that has cracked during summer cannot recover its hydraulic
   performance when rewetted — the cracks allow preferential seepage. EPDM maintains its barrier
   performance regardless of how many wet-dry cycles it experiences.

3. **A membrana EPDM pode ser instalada em taludes inclinados? Que inclinação máxima é possível?**
   EPDM can be installed on slopes up to 1:1 (45°) with appropriate anchor detailing. The standard
   installation for retention basin side slopes of 1:2 to 1:3 (H:V) does not require special
   anchoring beyond the standard perimeter anchor trench. For slopes steeper than 1:2, Membriko
   uses intermediate anchor strips bonded horizontally across the slope at 3-5 m vertical
   intervals. The anchor trench at the crest must be designed for the hydrostatic uplift force
   during the maximum water level event.

4. **O EPDM é aprovado para utilização em domínio público hídrico sob licença APA?**
   EPDM compliant with EN 13361 is a recognised geomembrane material for water retention
   structures. Membriko provides a full technical documentation package with each installation
   including EN 13361 compliance certificates, installation method statement, as-built drawings
   and the 20-year warranty certificate. This package is structured to support the licenciamento
   de utilização do domínio hídrico submission to APA.

5. **Qual a diferença entre uma bacia de retenção e uma bacia de detenção, e o EPDM é adequado
   para ambas?**
   A retention basin (bacia de retenção) maintains a permanent water body, retaining stormwater
   indefinitely or with a very slow controlled release. A detention basin (bacia de detenção)
   is normally dry and provides only temporary storage during and after a storm event, releasing
   water through a calibrated outlet over 12-72 hours. EPDM is the optimal liner for both types.
   For detention (dry) basins, EPDM is superior to clay because it withstands the drying periods
   between storm events without cracking.

6. **Como é feita a ligação da membrana EPDM aos órgãos hidráulicos (descarregadores, condutas)?**
   Connections to inlet pipes, outlet structures and overflow weirs are made using pre-formed
   EPDM pipe collars and flanged connectors. The collar is bonded to the main membrane with
   EPDM contact adhesive and QuickSeam tape; the pipe flange is then bolted to the collar using
   stainless steel hardware with a neoprene gasket, creating a mechanically secure, watertight
   seal. Concrete structure connections use a clamping bar system with two-component sealant.
   Membriko designs all penetration details project-specifically and includes them in the
   installation drawing package.

7. **Quanto tempo dura a instalação de uma bacia com 2.000 m² de membrana?**
   A 2,000 m² retention basin, assuming site preparation (earthworks) is complete and the
   subgrade is ready to receive the membrane, takes approximately 5-8 working days for membrane
   installation including geotextile underlay, panel placing and adhering, seaming, penetration
   details and perimeter anchor trench. Larger basins of 10,000 m² or more may take 3-5 weeks
   depending on site access and weather conditions. Membriko provides a project programme at
   the tender stage.

8. **A Membriko fornece documentação para licenciamento de bacias de retenção junto das câmaras
   municipais e da APA?**
   Yes. Membriko's standard handover package for retention basin projects includes: EN 13361
   product certificate, installation method statement and quality control records, as-built
   drawings with seam locations and penetration details, photographic record of installation
   stages, and the 20-year installation warranty certificate. This package is designed to meet
   the documentation requirements of both municipal licensing authorities and APA's domínio
   hídrico licensing process. Membriko can also participate in the design team at project
   inception to ensure the membrane specification aligns with the licensing requirements from
   the outset.
