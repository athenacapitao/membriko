# Retention Basin EPDM Lining — Stormwater Management for the Long Term

## Stormwater Management in an Uncertain Climate

The relationship between rainfall and urban flooding in Western Europe is being fundamentally
rewritten. Storm events that were once thirty-year occurrences now arrive every five. The
infrastructure that was built to manage post-war urbanisation — concrete channels, undersized
culverts, clay-lined detention ponds designed for a climate that no longer exists — is failing
at both ends of the hydrological spectrum. Intense rainfall overwhelms drainage capacity during
storm events. Prolonged summer droughts crack and destroy the clay liners that are supposed to
hold the water that arrives when the next storm finally breaks.

Retention basins are the most cost-effective structural response to this challenge. They work
on a principle of elegant simplicity: intercept the stormwater runoff from an urbanised catchment,
hold it until the receiving watercourse can safely accept it, and release it at a controlled rate
that does not cause downstream flooding. What natural ground cover and floodplain wetlands once
did passively, a retention basin does deliberately and measurably.

The design and hydrology of retention basins has been well understood for decades. The failure
point is not the engineering — it is the lining. Compacted clay cracks during dry periods and
loses its barrier integrity before the next significant storm arrives. HDPE geomembrane buckles
and wrinkles under summer thermal loading, concentrating stress at welded seams until they fail.
Concrete panels crack under differential settlement and require expensive joint resealing
throughout their service life.

Membriko, based in Pombal, Portugal, supplies and installs EPDM geomembrane lining for retention
basins, detention basins, infiltration basins and compensatory flood storage because EPDM is the
only liner material that addresses every failure mode simultaneously: it does not crack in drought,
it does not wrinkle in summer heat, and its 400% elongation absorbs ground settlement without
compromise. With a documented service life exceeding 50 years and a 20-year installation warranty,
Membriko's EPDM systems are not a temporary solution — they are infrastructure.

## Why EPDM is the Correct Choice for Retention Basin Lining

Choosing a liner material for a retention basin is an engineering decision whose consequences
extend across multiple asset management cycles. The three dominant lining approaches used in
Portugal — compacted clay, HDPE geomembrane, and reinforced concrete — each have a predictable
failure mode in the Mediterranean climate. EPDM shares none of these failure modes.

### Three Failure Modes That EPDM Does Not Have

**Compacted clay: desiccation cracking**

Compacted clay functions as a hydraulic barrier because saturated clay particles swell and block
soil pores, reducing hydraulic conductivity to the region of k < 10⁻⁹ m/s. This mechanism works
reliably when the clay remains moist. It stops working when the clay dries out: as moisture
evaporates, clay particles contract and the continuous barrier layer fractures into a pattern of
desiccation cracks that can extend through the full depth of the liner layer. In the Portuguese
interior — where July and August frequently pass without measurable rainfall and air temperatures
exceed 40°C — the clay liner of a detention basin that empties in spring may arrive at October
with its barrier integrity comprehensively destroyed. The water that refills it in November passes
straight through.

**HDPE geomembrane: thermal wrinkling and seam fatigue**

HDPE geomembrane is the geotechnical industry's reference material for large-scale liquid
containment — landfill cells, mine tailings lagoons, major water storage facilities. In open,
sun-exposed retention basins, HDPE has a specific vulnerability that is rarely prominent in
geomembrane specifications: a coefficient of thermal expansion of 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ /°C, approximately
five times higher than EPDM's 3 × 10⁻⁵ /°C. An HDPE panel installed at 12°C in March and
exposed to summer sunshine in the Alentejo can reach surface temperatures of 60-70°C by August.
Across a 50-metre basin, that temperature differential generates a linear expansion of 2.4-3.6 m,
manifesting as the characteristic undulation pattern — known in the industry as fishboning —
that concentrates stress at every extrusion-welded seam. Annual thermal cycling accumulates
seam fatigue until failure.

**Concrete and gunite: structural cracking and joint degradation**

Concrete appears impervious as a lining material, but it is fundamentally brittle. Any
differential settlement of the basin subgrade — entirely normal in the alluvial and colluvial
soils that are common in Portuguese river valley locations — propagates directly into the concrete
lining as a through-crack. The expansion joints required in concrete panels are vulnerable points
that require periodic resealing with mastic. Over a thirty-year management cycle, the maintenance
cost of a concrete-lined basin frequently exceeds the original installation cost of an EPDM liner.

### Why EPDM Eliminates These Failure Modes

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a vulcanised elastomeric rubber whose molecular
architecture makes it immune to all three failure modes above:

**Desiccation immunity**: EPDM does not contain water and does not rely on moisture to maintain
its mechanical or barrier properties. It can dry completely during summer, reach surface
temperatures of 70°C for weeks, and be reflooded in October without any performance change.
Membriko has installed EPDM membranes in basins that remain dry for more than 200 days per year,
and they continue to perform precisely as specified after fifteen or more years of service.

**Thermal stability without wrinkling**: EPDM's coefficient of thermal expansion is sufficiently
low that seasonal temperature variation in a sun-exposed Portuguese basin does not cause visible
wrinkling or seam stress concentration. EPDM field seams are made with contact adhesive and
QuickSeam tape — not by extrusion welding — and have a tensile strength that accommodates
membrane thermal movement without fatigue.

**Elastic settlement accommodation**: with an elongation at break exceeding 400%, the EPDM
membrane absorbs differential ground settlement elastically. Where 50 mm of localised subgrade
settlement occurs, the membrane deforms and recovers its geometry without compromising barrier
integrity. No other liner material offers this elastic and reversible accommodation of substrate
movement.

## Basin Types and EPDM Applications

Retention basins are not a single structure type. The hydraulic and environmental engineering
discipline recognises several distinct typologies, each with different liner requirements.
Membriko has experience across all of them.

### Wet Retention Basins

Wet retention basins maintain a permanent water body between storm events. The permanent pool
provides immediate attenuation capacity at the onset of any rainfall event, and creates an
aquatic ecosystem that provides passive stormwater treatment: sedimentation of suspended solids,
biological uptake of nutrients by emergent and submerged vegetation, and thermal moderation of
runoff before discharge.

Membriko lines wet retention basins with 1.5 mm EPDM (standard) or 2.0 mm (heavy duty, where
desludging machinery will operate on the basin floor). The membrane is installed over a 200-300 g/m²
geotextile protection layer, covering the basin floor and side slopes continuously to the anchor
line at the embankment crest. EPDM's chemical inertness — no plasticisers, heavy metals or
biocide residues leaching into the water column — makes it the correct choice for basins intended
to support aquatic biodiversity.

### Dry Detention Basins

Dry detention basins are normally empty and only accumulate water during and immediately after
storm events, releasing it through a calibrated outlet over a period of 12 to 72 hours. They
impose the most severe wet-dry cycling regime of any water retention structure — rapid inundation
followed by complete drying — combined with prolonged UV and thermal exposure between events.

Membriko specifies 1.5 mm EPDM for dry detention basins across Portugal, with particular
attention to the perimeter anchor trench detail, which must be designed to resist the hydraulic
uplift forces generated both during filling (hydrostatic pressure on the membrane) and during
rapid drawdown (differential pressure between the water column and the membrane underside).

### Infiltration Basins

Infiltration basins are designed for managed groundwater recharge, directing stormwater downward
through permeable subsoils into the underlying aquifer. They are typically unlined at the floor
by design. Membriko provides EPDM lining for infiltration basins in two specific scenarios:

1. **Bank lining only**: to prevent lateral seepage losses and direct all infiltration downward
   through the basin floor, protecting adjacent infrastructure from uncontrolled saturation
2. **Upstream pre-treatment cells**: EPDM-lined settling cells upstream of the infiltration zone
   capture suspended solids, heavy metals and hydrocarbons from the first flush, preventing
   these contaminants from entering the aquifer with the infiltrating water

### Compensatory Retention Basins

Compensatory basins are constructed to replace the natural floodplain storage capacity lost
to urban development. Portuguese municipal planning legislation — through Planos Directores
Municipais (PDM) and municipal drainage regulations — typically requires new developments to
demonstrate that post-development peak runoff does not exceed pre-development levels for specified
return period storms. Compensatory basins must reliably deliver their design storage volume
across a service life of 30 to 50 years.

Membriko provides EPDM lining for compensatory basins built as planning conditions of residential,
commercial and industrial development consents. The Membriko technical documentation package —
EN 13361 compliance certificate, installation method statement, as-built drawings, and the
20-year warranty certificate — is structured to support the planning authority approval process.

## Stormwater Regulations in Portugal

The regulatory framework governing stormwater management in Portugal is multilayered, combining
European directives transposed into national law with municipal planning instruments.

### European and National Legislative Framework

**EU Floods Directive (2007/60/EC) and Decree-Law 115/2010**

The Floods Directive required all EU member states to assess and manage flood risks systematically.
In Portugal it was transposed by Decreto-Lei 115/2010, which mandates the preparation of Planos
de Gestão dos Riscos de Inundação (Flood Risk Management Plans) for the major river basin
districts. These plans identify flood risk zones and specify mitigation measures, with retention
basin construction among the most important structural measures.

**Water Act (Lei 58/2005 and Decreto-Lei 130/2012)**

Portugal's Water Act, transposing the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), establishes
the licensing regime for use of the water domain (domínio hídrico). Stormwater retention basins
that discharge to surface water bodies require a water domain use licence from APA — Agência
Portuguesa do Ambiente. Licence applications must include hydraulic design documentation,
materials specifications, and environmental impact assessment where applicable.

**RGEU — General Urban Construction Regulations**

The Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas (Decree-Law 38,382/1951 and subsequent amendments)
governs urban construction including drainage infrastructure. Compliance with RGEU drainage
requirements is a condition of the construction permit (alvará de construção) issued by municipal
authorities for developments that include stormwater management infrastructure.

**ENAAC 2020 — National Climate Adaptation Strategy**

Portugal's national climate adaptation strategy explicitly recognises the increasing frequency
and intensity of extreme precipitation events and identifies the expansion of urban stormwater
retention capacity as a priority adaptation measure. Retention basins lined with 50-year EPDM
geomembrane are precisely the type of long-lived climate adaptation infrastructure that the
strategy prioritises.

### Municipal Requirements

Portuguese municipal authorities set stormwater management requirements through two primary instruments:

**Plano Director Municipal (PDM)**: establishes urbanisation parameters including peak flow
attenuation requirements for new development. Most PDMs revised after 2010 require that
developments above a threshold area include retention basins or equivalent attenuation devices
to demonstrate that post-development peak flows do not exceed pre-development levels.

**Regulamento Municipal de Urbanização e Edificação (RMUE)**: specifies the detailed technical
requirements for drainage infrastructure, referencing LNEC (National Civil Engineering Laboratory)
guidance publications as technical standards for stormwater management design.

Membriko has experience with the licensing requirements of municipal authorities across the
central Portugal region — Leiria, Coimbra, Aveiro, Santarém and Castelo Branco districts —
and provides technical documentation tailored to the submission formats of each authority.

## Installation Process: Eight Stages

The installation of an EPDM geomembrane in a retention basin is a precision engineering operation
that Membriko carries out according to a tested and documented process. Transparency about this
process is one of the most effective ways to give confidence to engineers and procurement officers
who have not previously specified EPDM for a basin lining project.

**Stage 1 — Topographic Survey and Design Review**

Membriko reviews the basin's engineering design, including the final topography, embankment
cross-sections, inlet and outlet structure positions, and the geotechnical investigation report
where available. This review establishes the membrane area, the optimal panel layout to minimise
field seam count, and the appropriate membrane thickness for the specific hydraulic and
geotechnical conditions.

**Stage 2 — Panel Layout and Cut Plan**

Membriko prepares the panel disposition drawing, maximising use of full-width panels (up to 15.25 m)
to reduce the number of field seams. Seam positions are planned on the basin side slopes, where
access is better and hydrostatic stress is lower than on the basin floor. The cut plan is delivered
to the client and to the supervising engineer before work commences.

**Stage 3 — Subgrade Preparation**

The basin subgrade must be trimmed to the specified geometry, compacted, and cleared of projecting
stones, roots and any sharp objects that could puncture the membrane. Membriko verifies subgrade
compliance before installation begins. On rocky or angular substrates, a compacted fine sand
layer (50-100 mm) or a higher-weight geotextile protection layer is specified and installed as
a sacrificial cushion.

**Stage 4 — Geotextile Protection Layer Installation**

A non-woven geotextile of 200-400 g/m² is installed over the entire prepared subgrade, with
500 mm overlaps at all joints. The geotextile protects the EPDM membrane from puncture by
angular substrate particles and distributes concentrated loads. Membriko selects the geotextile
weight based on the substrate particle size and the membrane thickness specified.

**Stage 5 — EPDM Membrane Installation**

EPDM panels are unrolled from the embankment crest downward into the basin, avoiding forced
tensioning of the membrane. Adjacent panels are overlapped 150 mm on side slopes and on the
basin floor, and bonded with EPDM contact adhesive and QuickSeam tape. The membrane is
temporarily weighted during installation to prevent wind displacement. Membriko verifies
that ambient temperature and humidity are within the adhesive manufacturers' application
limits before any field seam is made.

**Stage 6 — Hydraulic Structures: Inlets, Outlets and Spillways**

Membrane connections to inlet pipes, low-level outlets, emergency spillways and access
chambers are made using pre-formed EPDM pipe collars and stainless steel compression flanges.
Each penetration is treated as a unique detail, with extended adhesive and QuickSeam tape
overlay of minimum 150 mm radius around the penetration. Connections to concrete structures
(manhole walls, wingwalls) use metal anchor bars and two-component polyurethane sealant.
Membriko designs all penetration details project-specifically and provides them as part of
the installation drawing package.

**Stage 7 — Perimeter Anchor Trench**

The membrane edge is secured at the embankment crest by an anchor trench: the membrane is
folded into the trench to a minimum burial depth of 500 mm, and compacted fill is placed
over the folded membrane. For steeper slopes or high hydraulic head applications, a metal
anchor bar is additionally installed over the membrane fold before fill placement. The anchor
trench is dimensioned by Membriko to resist the hydrostatic uplift force at maximum design
water level.

**Stage 8 — Inspection, Hydraulic Test and Documentation**

Following installation completion, Membriko carries out a full visual inspection of all seams
and penetrations, followed by a staged hydraulic fill test to the maximum design water level.
The water level is monitored over 72 hours to verify watertightness. A photographic record
of all installation stages and seam locations is compiled, and Membriko's 20-year installation
warranty certificate is issued — a document that can be submitted to licensing authorities as
evidence of system quality and service life.

## Hydrological Sizing: The Context Membriko Understands

Membriko does not replace the hydraulic engineer — that expertise must reside with the certified
civil or water resources engineer responsible for the hydraulic design. But Membriko understands
the hydrological context of each project and acts as a technical partner to the design team,
rather than simply as a membrane supplier.

The parameters that determine retention basin size in Portugal include:

**Catchment area**: the total area draining to the basin, calculated by the hydraulic engineer
from topographic survey and GIS analysis.

**Runoff coefficient (C)**: typically 0.7-0.9 for paved urban surfaces; 0.1-0.3 for dry
agricultural land. The weighted average C value for the basin catchment determines the proportion
of rainfall converted to runoff.

**Design storm intensity**: reference intensities for Portugal vary significantly by region.
The north-west coast — including the Leiria district where Membriko is based — records the
highest 10-year return period rainfall intensities on the mainland. The Alentejo interior
records the lowest.

**Required storage volume**: typically 100-400 m³ per hectare of new impervious surface,
depending on the specific PDM requirements and the attenuation performance target.

**Membrane area**: the total liner area is the sum of the basin floor area and the side slope
areas at the design geometry (typically 1:2 to 1:3 horizontal to vertical), plus perimeter
anchor margins. Membriko provides membrane area calculations and panel disposition drawings
as part of the project review process, at no additional charge, for integration into the tender
or planning submission.

## EPDM vs HDPE vs Clay vs Concrete: The Comparative Analysis

The retention basin liner decision is frequently made on the basis of first-cost alone —
and this approach frequently leads to the wrong choice. Membriko presents the full comparison,
including lifecycle cost, to enable engineers and asset managers to make an informed decision.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | Compacted Clay | Concrete / Gunite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 30-40 years | 15-30 years (desiccation) | 20-40 years (joint failure) |
| Desiccation resistance | Excellent — unaffected | Good | Poor — cracks in summer | Good |
| Thermal stability | Excellent — no wrinkling | Poor at high temperatures | Good | Good |
| Seam count (large basin) | Low (panels to 15.25 m) | High (rolls 5-8 m) | N/A | High (formed joint count) |
| Installation plant requirement | Light — no welding equipment | Heavy — extrusion welders | Heavy — compaction plant | Heavy — batching and placing |
| Elasticity / crack bridging | Excellent — 400% elongation | Low — brittle post-yield | None | None |
| Root resistance | Excellent — EN 13948 | Good | Poor | Good |
| 50-year lifecycle cost index | 100 | 135 (replacement at year 35) | 160 (repairs and reconstruction) | 120 (joint resealing cycles) |

Membriko acknowledges that HDPE has genuine cost advantages in very large, geometrically simple
basins exceeding 20,000 m² where lower material cost per square metre can offset greater installation
complexity. For the majority of Portuguese retention basins — areas of 500 to 10,000 m², irregular
geometry following site topography, Mediterranean summer exposure and extended dry periods between
events — EPDM is the technically superior choice.

---

## Integration with the Urban and Rural Landscape

The concern that an EPDM-lined retention basin will look industrial or out of place is understandable
but unfounded in practice. A correctly designed basin with EPDM lining is substantially invisible
during normal operation when water covers the floor and lower slopes. During dry periods, when
the basin floor is exposed, black EPDM presents a more visually neutral appearance than grey
HDPE, frost-damaged concrete, or the cracked and weed-invaded surface of a failed clay liner.

Membriko works with landscape architects and civil engineers to integrate EPDM-lined basins into
the following landscape contexts:

**Vegetated embankments**: the perimeter anchor trench is installed at the embankment crest,
and the slopes above the anchor line can be seeded or planted with native grassland or shrub
species without any constraint imposed by the membrane below. Species such as *Cistus ladanifer*,
*Lavandula pedunculata*, *Pistacia lentiscus* and native grasses establish readily on compacted
embankment slopes above the EPDM line.

**Constructed wetlands**: EPDM-lined wet basins are the ideal substrate for constructed wetland
creation. Shallow margins (0-300 mm depth) can be planted with native emergent vegetation —
common reed (*Phragmites australis*), bulrush (*Typha angustifolia*), yellow iris (*Iris pseudacorus*)
— without any risk of membrane compromise from plant roots, given EPDM's certified root resistance
to EN 13948.

**Urban park integration**: some municipal authorities incorporate retention basins as quality
landscape features within urban parks, combining stormwater management with ornamental water
bodies and biodiversity habitat. EPDM's chemical inertness is essential in these applications
where the water body is in close contact with park users and wildlife.

**Agricultural and agro-industrial estates**: for wineries, olive presses and livestock operations
in the Alentejo and Ribatejo, EPDM-lined retention basins integrate naturally into the landscape
of a working estate, often concealed by riparian vegetation planted along the margins.

---

## Environmental Benefits of EPDM-Lined Retention Basins

Membriko incorporates environmental co-benefit arguments as an integral part of the EPDM value
proposition for retention basins — not as marketing language, but as objective advantages that
are relevant to environmental licensing processes and corporate sustainability reporting.

### Wetland Habitat Creation

EPDM-lined wet retention basins function as constructed wetland habitats. The complete absence
of plasticisers, biocides and heavy metals in the EPDM geomembrane ensures that the aquatic
ecosystem that establishes in the basin is not compromised by liner leachate contamination.
Wildfowl, amphibians, aquatic invertebrates and riparian vegetation colonise these basins
spontaneously where water quality and level stability are adequate. Membriko has supplied liners
for retention basins that now carry formal designation as biodiversity enhancement zones in their
planning approval conditions.

### Stormwater Quality Improvement

Well-designed retention basins, particularly wet basins with an adequate length-to-width ratio,
provide passive stormwater treatment through several mechanisms:

**Sedimentation**: 50-80% removal of total suspended solids (TSS) in basins with a length-to-width
ratio of 3:1 or greater and adequate hydraulic retention time. The flat EPDM basin floor provides
ideal conditions for sedimentation by eliminating the preferential flow channels that form in
uneven clay or concrete basin floors.

**Biological nutrient uptake**: emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation absorbs dissolved
nitrogen and phosphorus from urban and agricultural runoff, preventing eutrophication of
receiving watercourses.

**Thermal moderation**: stormwater runoff from hot paved surfaces (asphalt surface temperatures
reach 50-60°C in a Portuguese August) enters the basin warm and exits cooler, protecting the
thermal ecology of the receiving stream.

EPDM does not contribute contaminants to the water being treated — unlike bituminous liners,
which release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or lower-grade HDPE, which may release
photo-degraded UV stabiliser additives.

### Groundwater Protection

In basins located above vulnerable aquifers — common in the karstic geology of the Algarve
and in the alluvial plains of the Tagus and Sado catchments — the EPDM membrane with an
effective hydraulic conductivity of k < 10⁻¹⁵ m/s provides an essentially impermeable barrier
between potentially contaminated stormwater (carrying heavy metals from road wear, hydrocarbons
from vehicle washing, and agrochemicals from agricultural operations) and the underlying aquifer.
APA explicitly recognises this groundwater protection function in the licensing context for
basins located in designated groundwater protection zones.

### Lifecycle Carbon Accounting

A 1.5 mm EPDM geomembrane has an embodied carbon of approximately 4.2 kg CO₂e/m² at installation.
An HDPE geomembrane of equivalent thickness has approximately 2.8 kg CO₂e/m². However, HDPE
requires replacement at 30-35 years — adding a second complete installation carbon cost over
a 50-year assessment period. EPDM's 50+ year service life, combined with the significant earthwork
carbon avoided by not requiring a clay liner of 0.6-1.0 m depth, gives EPDM a lower whole-life
carbon footprint in the majority of retention basin applications.

## Maintenance: Designed for Minimal Intervention

One of the strongest commercial arguments for EPDM geomembrane in public sector asset management
is the near-zero specialist maintenance requirement across the full service life. Membriko documents
maintenance obligations precisely so that asset managers can plan operational budgets with confidence.

**Annual inspection programme:**

- Perimeter anchor trench: visual check that compacted fill cover has not settled or eroded to
  expose the membrane edge
- Hydraulic structure connections: inspect pipe collar seals and compression flanges at all inlet
  pipes, outlet structures and overflow weirs
- Field seam condition: visual inspection after significant storm events (rainfall exceeding the
  local 90th percentile threshold)
- Outlet obstruction check: verify that low-level outlets, overflow weirs and fish-pass structures
  are clear of debris and functioning as designed

**Desludging of wet retention basins:**

Wet basins accumulate sediment at a rate of 5-15% of storage volume per year, depending on the
suspended solids concentration of inflow. Desludging (typically required every 10-25 years) is
carried out by mechanical excavation or suction pump. EPDM's smooth, durable floor surface
facilitates desludging operations without membrane damage, provided that tracked plant does not
operate directly on the membrane without rubber matting protection.

**Puncture repair:**

Accidental membrane puncture — from anchoring in a recreational basin, from hand tools during
maintenance operations, or from windblown sharp debris — is repaired with an EPDM patch bonded
in dry conditions after basin drawdown. Emergency underwater repairs are possible using
immersion-grade EPDM adhesive, but permanent repair requires a dry surface. A single puncture
repair typically takes 2-4 hours. Membriko provides repair kits and guidance to all clients at
project handover.

**What to avoid:**

- Tracked plant operating directly on the membrane without protective rubber matting
- Sharp stone or rubble tipped directly onto the membrane
- Prolonged immersion in petroleum-based products (brief incidental contact is tolerated;
  continuous hydrocarbon immersion is not recommended without specialist chemical resistance
  confirmation)

Membriko offers scheduled inspection visits at five-year intervals for public sector clients,
with a written inspection report that satisfies regulatory documentation requirements and
provides the asset manager with a formal condition record.

## Sustainable Urban Drainage: The SuDS Context

Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) represent the shift from the "collect and convey"
paradigm of conventional urban drainage to an approach that mimics the pre-development hydrological
cycle: slow the water, spread it, let it sink, store what cannot sink, and clean it before it
reaches a receiving watercourse.

Within a typical SuDS train — permeable paving, bioretention cells, swales, filter strips —
the retention basin is the final storage component: the element that receives the stormwater
that upstream SuDS components have partially attenuated but not fully managed. The basin must
deliver precisely its design storage volume, because the upstream SuDS components have been
sized on the assumption that the basin will perform as specified.

An EPDM-lined retention basin, with its guaranteed barrier performance over 50 years, is the
reliable foundation on which the entire upstream SuDS train rests. A clay-lined basin that has
cracked and lost 40% of its storage volume due to desiccation is not a SuDS component — it is
a drainage liability.

LNEC (the National Civil Engineering Laboratory) has published technical guidance on SuDS design
for Portuguese conditions. Membriko's installation specifications are aligned with these guidelines
and Membriko's technical team can participate in project co-ordination meetings where SuDS
specifications are being agreed between the designer, the municipal authority and APA.

The Portugal 2030 programme and the Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência (PRR) include climate
urban resilience components that co-fund stormwater management infrastructure. EPDM-lined
retention basins are eligible for co-funding when included in urban climate resilience project
applications, providing an additional financial argument for specifying the highest-quality,
longest-life liner system available.

## Public and Private Sector Applications

### Public Sector

**Municipal Stormwater Management**

Portuguese municipalities manage retention basin assets through their water and sanitation
services (SMAS — Serviços Municipalizados de Água e Saneamento) or through private concessionaires
under regulated service agreements. Membriko serves this market with a procurement-compliant
value proposition: EN 13361-certified product specification, complete installation documentation,
and a 20-year warranty that reduces asset risk for both the municipality and the concessionaire.

The 50+ year EPDM service life aligns with the 30-50 year public infrastructure accounting cycles
used in Portuguese municipal asset management, eliminating the need for liner replacement within
normal financial planning horizons. Membriko participates in public procurement processes under
the Código dos Contratos Públicos (CCP), providing all required technical documentation for
tender admission.

**Road and Transport Infrastructure**

Portugal's road network — the autoestrada system managed by Infraestruturas de Portugal and
concessionaires such as BRISA — includes hundreds of stormwater retention basins managing
highway runoff. These basins require service lives of 30-50 years to match the infrastructure
asset management cycles of EU co-funded road schemes. Membriko provides EPDM geomembrane systems
for these applications, meeting both the technical performance requirements and the documentation
standards required for EU-funded infrastructure projects.

**Public Parks and Recreational Areas**

Urban retention ponds within public parks require a liner that remains safe and aesthetically
acceptable in a public-access environment. EPDM's chemical inertness — no leachate of plasticisers,
heavy metals or biocides into the water body — is essential in ponds where children and wildlife
interact with the water. Membriko has supplied EPDM liners for park retention ponds across
central Portugal that serve both flood management and habitat enhancement functions.

### Private Sector

**Industrial Parks and Logistics Platforms**

Large-footprint industrial and logistics developments generate substantial volumes of impervious
surface runoff. Environmental licensing of these facilities commonly requires retention basins
for peak flow control and first-flush pollution prevention. Membriko lines these basins with
EPDM geomembrane, combining regulatory compliance with 50-year service life and minimal ongoing
maintenance burden.

**Agro-Industrial Facilities**

Wineries, olive oil mills, fruit packing operations and livestock enterprises across the Alentejo,
Ribatejo and Beira Litoral generate process water and contaminated runoff requiring lined retention
and treatment lagoons. Membriko provides EPDM lining for these applications, benefiting from
EPDM's chemical resistance to the acidic and alkaline effluents characteristic of agro-industrial
operations.

**Golf Courses**

The Algarve, Comporta and Troia Peninsula concentrate dozens of golf courses that use retention
basins for irrigation water storage combined with stormwater management. Membriko supplies and
installs EPDM liners for these storage facilities, which are typically required to meet both
water quality standards for irrigation reuse and APA licensing requirements for water domain use.

**Residential and Commercial Development**

Planning conditions on residential and commercial developments commonly require compensatory
retention basins as a condition of the construction permit (alvará de construção). Membriko
works with developers from the planning submission stage to ensure that the membrane specification
meets municipal requirements and that the technical documentation supports the licensing process
from the outset.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What thickness of EPDM membrane is recommended for a municipal retention basin?**

Membriko's standard specification for municipal retention basins is 1.5 mm EPDM, compliant with
EN 13361. For basins where desludging machinery will operate directly on the basin floor, or
where the subgrade contains coarse angular stone, Membriko recommends 2.0 mm. For small private
compensatory basins or low-traffic agricultural ponds, 1.0 mm may be appropriate. Membriko
provides a thickness recommendation as part of the project design review process at no additional
charge.

**Does EPDM genuinely withstand complete drying during Portuguese summers? Our clay liner has
cracked.**

This is EPDM's single most important advantage over clay in the Mediterranean context. EPDM is
an elastomeric rubber that contains no water and does not depend on moisture to maintain its
mechanical or barrier properties. It can dry completely, reach surface temperatures of 70°C
for weeks, and be reflooded without any performance change. A clay liner that has desiccation-cracked
during summer cannot recover its hydraulic conductivity when rewetted — the cracks create
preferential seepage pathways that persist. EPDM does not have this failure mode.

**Can EPDM membrane be installed on steep embankment slopes? What is the maximum slope?**

Membriko installs EPDM on slopes up to 1:1 (45°) with appropriate anchor detailing. For the
1:2 to 1:3 (H:V) side slopes typical of most retention basins, the standard installation with
perimeter anchor trench at the crest is sufficient. For slopes steeper than 1:2, intermediate
horizontal anchor strips are installed at 3-5 m vertical intervals across the slope. The EPDM
to geotextile interface friction angle of 18° (ASTM D5321) guarantees stability on slopes up
to 1:2 without intermediate anchoring.

**Is EPDM an approved material for structures in the Portuguese water domain, subject to APA
licensing?**

EPDM compliant with EN 13361 is a recognised geomembrane material for water retention structures.
Membriko provides a complete technical documentation package with every installation, including:
EN 13361 product compliance certificate, installation method statement and quality control records,
as-built drawings with seam locations and penetration details, staged photographic record, and
the 20-year installation warranty certificate. This package is structured to meet the documentation
requirements of the APA water domain use licensing process.

**What is the difference between a retention basin and a detention basin, and is EPDM suitable
for both?**

A wet retention basin maintains a permanent water body, retaining stormwater indefinitely or
with very slow controlled release. A dry detention basin is normally empty and provides only
temporary storage during and after storm events, releasing water through a calibrated outlet
over 12-72 hours. EPDM is the optimal liner for both types. For dry detention basins in
particular, EPDM is superior to clay because it withstands the dry periods between storm events
without cracking — exactly the failure mode that makes clay-lined detention basins unreliable
in Mediterranean climates.

**How are EPDM membrane connections made to inlet pipes, outlet structures and spillways?**

Connections to inlet pipes, low-level outlets, emergency spillways and access chambers are made
using pre-formed EPDM pipe collars and stainless steel compression flanges. The collar is bonded
to the main membrane with EPDM contact adhesive and QuickSeam tape; the pipe passes through
the collar and is sealed with a compression flange and neoprene gasket, creating a mechanically
secure, watertight connection. Concrete structure connections use metal anchor bars and two-
component polyurethane sealant. Membriko designs all penetration details project-specifically
and includes them in the installation drawing package.

**How long does installation take for a 2,000 m² retention basin?**

A 2,000 m² retention basin, with earthworks complete and subgrade ready to receive the membrane,
requires approximately 5-8 working days for complete membrane installation — including geotextile
protection layer, panel placing and bonding, field seaming, penetration details and perimeter
anchor trench. Larger basins of 10,000 m² or more may require 3-5 weeks depending on site
access, panel logistics and weather conditions. Membriko provides a project programme at the
tender or consultation stage.

**Does Membriko provide documentation for licensing by municipal authorities and APA?**

Yes. Membriko's standard handover package for retention basin projects includes: EN 13361 product
certificate, installation method statement and quality control records, as-built drawings with
seam locations and all penetration details, photographic record of all installation stages, and
the 20-year installation warranty certificate. This package is designed to meet the documentation
requirements of both municipal planning authorities and APA's water domain use licensing process.
Membriko can also attend project meetings at the planning submission stage to ensure that the
membrane specification aligns with regulatory requirements from the outset, reducing the risk of
requests for additional information during the licensing process.
