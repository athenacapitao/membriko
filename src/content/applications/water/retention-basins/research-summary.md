# Retention Basins — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Stormwater and Retention Basin Lining: Core Relevance

Retention basins (bacias de retenção) and detention basins (bacias de detenção) are engineered
hydraulic structures designed to receive, temporarily store, and control the release of stormwater
runoff. Their primary function is to decouple peak runoff discharge from the precipitation event,
attenuating flood peaks and managing diffuse pollution loads before water enters receiving
watercourses or groundwater systems.

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is uniquely well-suited to retention basin lining for a
combination of reasons that no single alternative material replicates:

1. **Wet-dry cycling tolerance**: retention basins alternate between full inundation during storm
   events and extended dry periods between events. EPDM maintains dimensional stability and
   membrane integrity through unlimited wet-dry cycles without cracking, shrinking or delamination.
2. **Root resistance**: vegetation is commonly established on basin banks and around the basin
   perimeter for aesthetic integration and erosion control. EPDM is root-resistant per FLL test
   protocol and EN 13948, preventing vegetative root penetration of the liner.
3. **UV resistance**: during dry periods, the basin floor and lower banks are exposed to full
   solar UV. EPDM's carbon-black UV absorber system provides indefinite UV resistance without
   a separate surface protection requirement.
4. **Wide-panel availability**: large retention basins require liner panels covering several
   thousand square metres. EPDM is manufactured in panels up to 15.25 m wide and can be factory-
   vulcanised into sheets covering several hundred square metres, minimising seam count and seam
   failure risk.
5. **Flexible geometry**: basins are not rectangular — they follow site topography, have variable
   side slopes, inlet structures and outlet weirs that require penetration detailing. EPDM's
   400%+ elongation accommodates all of these geometric complexities in a single continuous membrane.

## Types of Stormwater Retention Structures and EPDM Application Scenarios

### Wet Retention Basins (Bacias de Retenção Húmidas)

Wet retention basins maintain a permanent water body between storm events. They provide long-term
detention of stormwater, allowing sedimentation of suspended solids, biological uptake of nutrients,
and thermal/UV attenuation of contamination. EPDM lining in wet basins:
- Prevents loss of the permanent water body through seepage into permeable subsoils
- Provides a clean, chemically inert substrate for the bottom and bank zones that are permanently
  wetted
- Resists the continuous hydrostatic pressure of the permanent pool (typically 1-3 m depth)
- Compatible with aquatic vegetation colonisation and wetland habitat creation

### Dry Detention Basins (Bacias de Detenção Secas)

Dry detention basins are normally dry and fill only during storm events, releasing water through a
controlled outlet structure over a period of 12-72 hours following the event. EPDM lining in dry
basins:
- Prevents rapid seepage loss that would cause uncontrolled drawdown and unpredictable outlet
  hydrographs
- Withstands the most demanding wet-dry cycling regime of any water retention structure
- Provides a surface resistant to desiccation cracking — a critical failure mode in unlined clay
  or compacted soil basins in the Portuguese summer climate

### Infiltration Basins (Bacias de Infiltração)

Infiltration basins are designed to promote managed seepage into groundwater. They are typically
unlined or partially lined, but EPDM is used in specific infiltration basin applications:
- Partial lining (banks only, floor unlined) to control lateral seepage and direct water downward
  through the floor only
- Lining of pre-treatment cells upstream of the infiltration zone to capture pollutants before
  they enter the groundwater
- Lining of outlet structures and weirs where erosion control is required

### Compensatory Retention Basins (Bacias de Compensação)

Compensatory basins are constructed to replace natural flood storage capacity lost to urban
development, as mandated by Portuguese hydraulic planning legislation. These basins must reliably
retain design flood volumes. EPDM lining is appropriate where:
- The basin substrate is permeable (sandy or gravelly soils) and seepage would compromise design
  storage volume
- The basin must demonstrate hydrological performance to regulatory authorities (SNIRH/APA)
- Long service life without maintenance is required (public infrastructure, remote locations)

## Portuguese Regulatory and Municipal Context

### APA — Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente

APA is the national environmental regulatory authority. Under Decreto-Lei 130/2012 (Water Law) and
the associated regulations, stormwater management structures that discharge to water bodies are
subject to licenciamento de utilização do domínio hídrico (water domain use licensing). EPDM-lined
basins must be designed and constructed to meet:
- Hydraulic performance criteria (attenuation of peak flows to pre-development levels)
- Water quality requirements for discharge (suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, heavy
  metals as appropriate to land use)
- Structural integrity requirements for a design service life (typically 30-50 years for public
  infrastructure)

### SNIRH — Sistema Nacional de Informação de Recursos Hídricos

SNIRH is APA's national water resources information and management system. Retention basin
construction in regulated catchments requires registration and performance reporting through SNIRH
where basins are part of a licensed water management scheme.

### RGEU — Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas

RGEU (Decreto-Lei 38.382/1951, as amended) governs urban construction including drainage
infrastructure. Urban retention basins constructed as part of residential or commercial development
licensing must comply with RGEU drainage requirements and local Câmara Municipal plano municipal
de urbanização provisions.

### Municipal Requirements

Portuguese Câmaras Municipais typically specify stormwater management requirements through:
- Plano Director Municipal (PDM): sets broad stormwater attenuation requirements for new
  development, typically requiring post-development peak flows not to exceed pre-development
  levels for defined return period storms (2, 10, 100-year)
- Regulamento Municipal de Urbanização e Edificação (RMUE): specifies detailed technical
  requirements for drainage infrastructure including basin design standards
- LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) guidance documents: referenced by many
  municipalities as technical standards for stormwater management design

### SuDS (Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems) in Portugal

Portugal has been progressively adopting SuDS principles, driven by:
- EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) transposed as Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005)
- EU Floods Directive (2007/60/EC) transposed as Decreto-Lei 115/2010
- National climate adaptation strategy (Estratégia Nacional de Adaptação às Alterações Climáticas,
  ENAAC 2020) which recognises the increasing flood risk from climate change
- Urban heat island mitigation strategies in municipal climate plans (PDM and PAMUS — Plano de
  Ação Municipal de Urbanismo Sustentável)

Portuguese SuDS framework includes: permeable paving, green roofs, bioretention cells, swales,
retention ponds and wetlands. EPDM lining is a core enabling technology for the lined retention
pond and constructed wetland components of SuDS schemes.

## EPDM vs HDPE Geomembrane for Basin Lining

HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) geomembrane is the most common alternative to EPDM for large-scale
retention basin lining. A rigorous comparison:

**HDPE:**
- Standard grades: 0.75 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm (smooth and textured)
- Tensile strength: 29-40 N/mm² (much higher than EPDM due to semi-crystalline structure)
- Elongation at break: 700-900% in yield; however, post-yield elongation is plastic (permanent
  deformation), not elastic. HDPE does not recover from deformation.
- Thermal expansion: HDPE has a coefficient of thermal expansion of 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ /°C, approximately
  5× higher than EPDM (3 × 10⁻⁵ /°C). In large basin installations exposed to Portuguese summer
  temperatures, HDPE panels exhibit significant thermal wrinkling ("fishboning") when the material
  expands. These wrinkles concentrate stress and can lead to seam fatigue.
- UV resistance: requires carbon black ≥ 2% for outdoor UV resistance; standard geomembrane
  grades are UV-stabilised but are considered to have a 30-50 year outdoor service life compared
  to EPDM's 50+ years
- Flexibility at low temperatures: HDPE becomes brittle at temperatures below -10 to -15°C;
  not relevant for most Portuguese applications
- Seaming: extrusion welding or hot-wedge welding; requires specialist equipment and trained
  operators; quality is highly operator-dependent; seams are stress concentrations
- Factory panel size: HDPE rolls are typically 5-8 m wide; large basins require many seams
- Puncture resistance: lower than EPDM of equivalent thickness due to HDPE's stiffness; a
  stone beneath an HDPE membrane will create a stress concentration under loading; EPDM
  conforms around it

**EPDM advantages over HDPE in retention basins:**
1. Superior thermal stability: no wrinkling under Portuguese summer temperature cycling
2. Elastic (not plastic) elongation: temporary deformation (from substrate settlement, vegetation
   root pressure, frost heave) is recovered without permanent damage
3. Larger factory panels: up to 15.25 m wide vs 5-8 m for HDPE; fewer seams; each seam is a
   potential failure point
4. Easier field seaming: EPDM seams are made with contact adhesive and QuickSeam tape; no
   specialist welding equipment required; quality is less operator-dependent than HDPE extrusion
   welding
5. Softer surface: EPDM does not create the underwater sound amplification effect of rigid HDPE
   panels (relevant for basins used as wildlife habitat)

**HDPE advantages over EPDM in specific scenarios:**
- Very large, simple-geometry basins (>20,000 m²) where HDPE's lower material cost per square
  metre offsets installation complexity
- Applications requiring maximum puncture resistance for very coarse aggregate overlays
- Applications where regulatory specifications explicitly call for HDPE geomembrane

## EPDM vs Clay Liner (Bentonite Geosynthetic Liner / Compacted Clay)

Clay-based liners are the historical standard for retention basin lining in Portugal:
- **Compacted clay liner (CCL)**: requires low-permeability clay (hydraulic conductivity
  k < 10⁻⁹ m/s), compacted in lifts of 150-300 mm to achieve the design barrier; typically
  0.6-1.0 m thick; highly susceptible to desiccation cracking during dry periods
- **Geosynthetic Clay Liner (GCL / Bentonite mat)**: 5-10 mm bentonite layer sandwiched between
  geotextiles; much thinner than CCL; good self-healing properties but sensitive to desiccation
  and contamination by high-ionic-strength water (calcium, magnesium in hard water areas)

**EPDM advantages over clay liners:**
1. Desiccation resistance: clay liners crack during dry periods; desiccation cracking is the
   single most common cause of clay liner failure in dry-summer climates like Portugal's.
   EPDM does not crack regardless of temperature or moisture content.
2. Thickness and material volume: EPDM at 1.0-1.5 mm vs 600-1,000 mm clay layer; massive
   reduction in earthwork volume, cost and carbon footprint
3. Performance certainty: EPDM hydraulic performance (essentially impermeable: k < 10⁻¹⁵ m/s
   equivalent) is independent of installation quality variability; clay liner permeability is
   highly sensitive to compaction quality, moisture content and mineralogy
4. Slope stability: clay liners on steep slopes (>1:3) are prone to saturated slip; EPDM
   anchored at the crest is stable on slopes up to 1:1.5

## Environmental and Ecological Benefits of EPDM-Lined Retention Basins

### Wetland Creation

EPDM-lined retention basins are readily converted into functioning wetland habitats by design:
- Shallow marginal zones (0-300 mm depth) planted with emergent aquatics (Phragmites australis,
  Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudacorus) — native Portuguese wetland species
- Open water zones (0.5-2.0 m depth) providing foraging habitat for wading birds and waterfowl
- EPDM's chemical inertness ensures no contamination of the aquatic ecosystem from liner
  leachates — critical for ecological function
- Root resistance prevents liner compromise from wetland plant root systems over the 50+ year
  service life

### Water Quality Improvement

Retention basins, particularly wet basins, provide passive stormwater treatment through:
- Sedimentation of suspended solids (50-80% TSS removal in well-designed basins)
- Biological uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus by aquatic vegetation
- Thermal moderation of stormwater before discharge to receiving watercourses
- Microbial degradation of organic compounds in the sediment zone

EPDM's chemical inertness ensures the liner does not contribute contaminants to the water being
treated — unlike bituminous or PVC liners that can release aromatic hydrocarbons and plasticisers.

### Carbon Footprint Comparison

Life cycle analysis of basin lining materials:
- Compacted clay liner (1.0 m): high embodied energy in earthwork plant operation; significant
  transport of clay fill if local borrow pits are unavailable
- HDPE geomembrane (1.5 mm): embodied carbon approximately 2.8 kg CO₂e/m²
- EPDM (1.5 mm): embodied carbon approximately 4.2 kg CO₂e/m² at installation, but over 50-year
  service life with no replacement, HDPE (requiring replacement at 30-35 years) has higher
  life cycle carbon

## Portuguese Market Context for Retention Basin EPDM

Portugal has an estimated 2,500-4,000 municipal and private retention basins in operation, with
the majority concentrated in:
- Urban fringe developments on the Lisbon and Porto metropolitan periphery where post-development
  stormwater management is a planning condition
- Industrial parks and logistics developments in the Setúbal, Aveiro, Braga and Alentejo interior
  corridors
- Agri-industrial facilities (olive oil presses, wine production, meat processing) in the Alentejo
  and Ribatejo where process water storage and treatment ponds are required
- Golf courses in the Algarve and Comporta areas where irrigation reservoir storage is combined
  with stormwater management functions

The dominant lining approach historically has been unlined clay or compacted earth — with
predictable performance issues during dry summers. EPDM geomembrane penetration in the Portuguese
retention basin market is estimated at 8-12% of new installations (2024), growing rapidly as
awareness of clay liner desiccation failure and HDPE wrinkling issues becomes more widely
documented among civil engineers and municipal water authorities.

Membriko, based in Pombal, is positioned to serve the central Portugal corridor (Leiria, Coimbra,
Aveiro, Santarém, Castelo Branco districts) as the primary market geography for retention basin
projects, while also serving national-scale industrial clients across Portugal.
