# Rainwater Harvesting — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Rainwater harvesting (captação de águas pluviais) is a growing market segment in Portugal
driven by three converging pressures: increasing summer drought intensity, rising municipal
water tariffs, and growing awareness of water scarcity as a strategic risk for both
agricultural and residential properties. Portugal's Mediterranean south — the Alentejo and
Algarve — has a cultural tradition of cistern-based water storage that EPDM technology
upgrades rather than replaces.

The page must serve three primary audiences:

1. **Rural and agricultural property owners** in the Alentejo, Algarve, and Beiras who
   manage irrigation and stock water requirements from on-property storage, often upgrading
   ageing concrete or earth cisterns
2. **Residential and peri-urban property owners** seeking to reduce mains water dependence
   for toilet flushing, garden irrigation, and car washing — often in the context of new
   construction or renovation
3. **Architects, engineers, and developers** specifying rainwater management systems in
   building projects, particularly in climate zones where water self-sufficiency has become
   a design parameter

The persuasion architecture follows this arc: establish the scale of Portugal's water
scarcity problem (with regional specificity), explain why EPDM is the correct material
for long-term cistern waterproofing, describe the system types in full, validate the
approach with technical data and regulatory context, then close with the Membriko process
and cost-benefit case. The cultural resonance of the traditional Alentejo cistern — the
cisterna de pedra as a heritage infrastructure — should be acknowledged: Membriko modernises
a practice that has existed for centuries, not invents something new.

## Section 1: Introduction — Water Scarcity in Portugal and the Cistern Tradition

**Purpose:** Establish context and urgency without hyperbole. Connect the reader to their
lived experience of Portuguese water stress.

**Content:**
- Open with the reality of water scarcity in southern Portugal: the Alentejo and Algarve
  summers where springs dry up, agricultural water restrictions are imposed, and mains
  water tariffs have increased significantly in recent years
- The regional dimension: the difference in water security between a property in the
  Minho (abundant rainfall, minor concern) and one in the Alentejo or Algarve (strategic
  issue; properties without water storage are exposed)
- Reference the traditional cisterna: in the Alentejo and Algarve, every old quinta has
  a stone cistern. The tradition of capturing winter rainfall for summer use is centuries
  old. EPDM is the material that makes the modern version of that cistern permanent
- The Membriko answer: custom-sized EPDM-lined cisterns that capture roof and terrace
  runoff and store it without leakage, without degradation, for 50+ years
- Stat block: 50+ year service life / up to 5,000 m² collection area served / 400%
  elongation / 20-year Membriko warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Dimensionamento Gratuito"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Rainwater Storage

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — explain why EPDM outperforms all alternative liner
and tank materials for long-term rainwater storage.

**Content:**
- The requirements for a long-service rainwater cistern liner: watertightness over decades;
  resistance to water immersion without chemical degradation; compatibility with the
  spectrum of rainwater chemistry (slightly acidic, pH 5.5-7.0, low mineral content);
  UV stability for above-ground and at-waterline applications; flexibility to bridge
  substrate cracks and accommodate thermal movement
- Why EPDM satisfies all these requirements: saturated polymer backbone (no oxidative
  degradation from dissolved oxygen in stored water); no plasticisers (no migration into
  stored water); 400% elongation (accommodates ground settlement and concrete cracking
  without compromising watertightness); UV stability intrinsic (carbon black, saturated
  chain)
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Value | Test Method |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness (cistern standard) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | Water absorption | < 1% by weight | ASTM D471 |
  | pH range (water contact) | 4.0 to 12.0 | — |
  | UV resistance | No degradation at 2,000 hrs | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |
- Water quality note: no plasticisers, no biocides, no heavy metals that migrate into
  stored water; WRAS and ACS certifications confirm water contact suitability

## Section 3: System Types — Underground, Above-Ground, Integrated

**Purpose:** Show that EPDM cistern solutions are appropriate for every property type
and scale.

**Content:** Three system type descriptions.

**Underground Cisterns (Cisternas Subterrâneas)**
- The optimal configuration for hot climates: underground storage maintains water at
  ground temperature (12-18°C), suppressing biological activity and evaporation
- Construction: excavated earth or masonry walls lined with EPDM; concrete lid or
  timber cover with access hatch; inlet, overflow and pump access penetrations through
  EPDM with purpose-made fittings
- Scale: practical for 5,000-200,000+ litre capacities; larger than any prefabricated
  tank available; sized to match available collection area
- Portuguese context: the traditional Alentejo and Algarve stone cistern is exactly
  this configuration, upgraded with EPDM instead of lime mortar or cement render

**Above-Ground Cisterns (Cisternas à Superfície)**
- Applications: where excavation is not possible (rock substrate, groundwater table,
  basement below), or where gravity distribution from an elevated position is required
- Construction: masonry, concrete block, timber frame or steel frame structure lined
  with EPDM; perimeter termination at the top edge with aluminium capping rail
- UV requirement: above-ground EPDM is UV-stable without additives; the only liner
  material that can be confidently specified for exposed above-ground installation
  without a protective cover for the membrane itself
- Scale: typically 5,000-50,000 litres; very large above-ground volumes require
  structural engineering for the support structure

**Integrated Cisterns Below Paved Surfaces (Cisternas Integradas)**
- The most space-efficient configuration for urban and peri-urban properties: cistern
  volume created below a terrace, driveway, or planted area without sacrificing
  usable surface
- Construction: a concrete structural slab with EPDM lining above or a purpose-built
  below-slab box; EPDM accommodates structural deflection under traffic and pedestrian
  loading on the cover slab
- Connection to the building's rainwater drainage system: integrated design allows
  roof drainage to feed directly into the cistern without surface pipework

## Section 4: Water Quality and EPDM Safety

**Purpose:** Address the concern that a rubber liner might affect stored water quality;
establish that EPDM is the liner choice that least affects rainwater chemistry.

**Content:**
- The central concern: any liner in contact with stored water will have some interaction
  with that water. For rainwater intended for domestic non-potable use (toilet flushing,
  garden irrigation), the critical question is whether the liner releases compounds that
  impair the water's intended use or, in the case of irrigation, harm plants or soil
- Why EPDM is the safest choice:
  - No plasticisers to migrate (unlike PVC, which leaches phthalates into stored water,
    particularly at elevated temperatures in above-ground installations)
  - No chlorinated compounds (unlike PVC, which contains chlorine in its molecular
    structure and generates chlorinated byproducts when degraded)
  - No antimicrobial additives that contaminate water (unlike some HDPE liners)
  - Minimal organic compound extraction confirmed by BS 6920 (WRAS) and ACS testing
- WRAS and ACS certification: explain what these certifications test and mean;
  Membriko specifies only WRAS/ACS-certified EPDM for cisterns where water will be
  used for domestic purposes
- Biofilm note: all non-disinfected water storage develops biofilm; this is managed
  by periodic cleaning; EPDM is fully compatible with hypochlorite cleaning at any
  relevant concentration

## Section 5: Installation Process (8 Steps)

**Purpose:** Demystify the installation and make the process feel professionally managed.

**Content:** Numbered process.

1. **Levantamento e Dimensionamento** — Free on-site visit: measurement of available
   collection surfaces, assessment of ground conditions for underground cisterns,
   identification of integration points with existing drainage; sizing calculation
   using LNEC E 452 methodology
2. **Projecto de Solução** — Proposal specifying cistern type, dimensions, volume, EPDM
   specification, inlet/outlet/overflow details, pump and distribution system if required
3. **Preparação da Estrutura** — Excavation or masonry construction of the cistern
   structure; surface preparation: smooth finish, no sharp edges, no standing water;
   for masonry structures: cement render base coat
4. **Instalação da Membrana EPDM** — Membrane placement: large-panel layout minimising
   seams; full-surface adhesive bonding with immersion-rated EPDM adhesive on all
   walls and floor; corner pre-formed pieces at all angle changes
5. **Emendas e Pontos Singulares** — All seams bonded with QuickSeam tape; penetration
   sleeves for inlet, overflow and pump access installed with EPDM-specific flanged
   compression fittings; no mastic or silicone as primary seal
6. **Terminação Perimetral** — Membrane termination at the top of the cistern wall with
   aluminium or stainless steel capping rail, mechanically fixed; provides protection
   from UV and mechanical damage at the exposed edge
7. **Cobertura e Acessos** — Concrete lid, timber cover or structural slab installed
   above cistern; access hatch and pump cable/pipe penetrations sealed; overflow
   connected to drainage or soakaway
8. **Teste e Garantia** — 72-hour water fill test with level monitoring; photographic
   as-built documentation; 20-year Membriko installation warranty issued

## Section 6: Sizing for Portuguese Rainfall — The Collection Calculation

**Purpose:** Give the reader a practical understanding of how cistern volume is determined,
using Portuguese rainfall data and real examples.

**Content:**
- The rainfall variability in Portugal: map reference or data showing the gradient from
  the Minho (2,500+ mm/year) to the Algarve (500 mm/year)
- The collection formula: V = A × P × C × E (collection area × rainfall × runoff
  coefficient × efficiency factor)
- Runoff coefficients table:
  | Surface | Runoff Coefficient (C) |
  |---|---|
  | Traditional clay tile roof | 0.80-0.88 |
  | Concrete or fibre-cement roof | 0.85-0.92 |
  | Flat concrete terrace | 0.85-0.95 |
  | Gravel surface | 0.20-0.35 |
  | Lawn / planted surface | 0.10-0.20 |
- Worked example — residential property in Évora (550 mm/year):
  Roof area: 180 m²; terrace: 60 m²; combined with C = 0.85; efficiency = 0.90
  V = 240 × 550 × 0.85 × 0.90 = 101,100 litres/year
  Recommended cistern: 15,000-25,000 litres
- Worked example — quinta in the Alentejo with agricultural use (520 mm/year):
  Roof collection area: 400 m² (house + farm buildings); C = 0.87; efficiency = 0.90
  V = 400 × 520 × 0.87 × 0.90 = 162,864 litres/year
  Recommended cistern: 30,000-50,000 litres for irrigation bridge over dry season
- Non-potable use demands table:
  | Use | Consumption |
  |---|---|
  | Toilet flushing | 35-50 litres/person/day |
  | Garden irrigation (100 m²) | 30-80 litres/day (summer) |
  | Vehicle washing | 150-250 litres/event |
  | Livestock watering | highly site-specific |

## Section 7: Integration with Building Water Systems

**Purpose:** Show that EPDM cisterns are a complete system, not just a tank; address
the technical integration questions.

**Content:**
- First-flush diverter (separador de primeiras águas): the first 1-2 mm of each rainfall
  event carries the highest concentration of particulates, bird droppings, and atmospheric
  dust from the roof; automatic diverters bypass this water to drainage; critical for
  any cistern serving domestic uses; Membriko advises on selection and sizing
- Inlet design: submerged inlet with calming diffuser to minimise sediment disturbance;
  inlet pipe should discharge below minimum water level
- Overflow management: sized for the most intense rainfall event the cistern will receive
  (typically 10-year return period, 15-minute intensity); overflow should discharge to
  soakaway, garden irrigation, or surface drainage
- Extraction system: submersible pump with level sensor; distribution network for non-
  potable uses; clearly marked to prevent cross-connection with potable water (required
  by NP EN 1717 and Portaria 23/2021)
- Treatment for indoor non-potable use: sediment filter (50-100 micron); UV disinfection
  recommended for toilet flushing water; activated carbon optional for odour control
- Monitoring: water level indicator; mains water backup for critical uses during extended
  droughts; smart controllers available for integration with home automation systems

## Section 8: EPDM vs Concrete / HDPE / Plastic Tanks / GRP

**Purpose:** Provide the comparison that potential clients are conducting before they
arrive at the Membriko page.

**Content:** Comparison table with 7 rows.

| Feature | EPDM Liner (Membriko) | Concrete Cistern | HDPE/PP Tank | GRP/Polyester Tank |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Custom volume | Any volume — built to site | High cost for large volumes | Limited to prefabricated sizes | Medium volumes; transport limits |
| Service life | 50+ years | 30-50 years (with internal coating) | 15-25 years (above ground) | 20-30 years (gel coat) |
| Plasticisers in water | None | None (if uncoated) | None (HDPE) | None |
| UV resistance (above ground) | Excellent — intrinsic | N/A (concrete) | Poor — requires shading | Moderate — gel coat degrades |
| Flexibility (crack bridging) | Excellent — 400% elongation | None — rigid | N/A | None — brittle |
| Installation flexibility | Any geometry; in situ | Requires formwork | Fixed geometry | Fixed geometry |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 140 (recoating) | 160 (replacement) | 130 (gel coat) |

Honest acknowledgement: prefabricated HDPE tanks are a valid, lower-upfront-cost solution
for volumes under 5,000 litres when site access is uncomplicated. Membriko's EPDM approach
becomes the clear technical choice for volumes above 10,000 litres, for geometrically
constrained sites, for above-ground cisterns, and for agricultural open reservoirs where
prefabricated tanks are impractical.

## Section 9: Portuguese Regulations — DL 236/98, DL 119/2021, Water Reuse

**Purpose:** Establish regulatory competence and confirm that Membriko's approach meets
current Portuguese and EU requirements.

**Content:**
- Decreto-Lei 236/98: establishes water quality standards for various uses; Annex XVI
  covers agricultural irrigation water quality; harvested rainwater for garden irrigation
  typically satisfies these parameters without treatment
- Decreto-Lei 119/2021 (water reuse framework): establishes four water quality classes
  for reclaimed water; rainwater for toilet flushing is non-potable water reuse within
  buildings — requires physical separation from potable water (NP EN 1717); storage
  system must be watertight and constructed of materials not impairing water quality
- Portaria 23/2021: technical requirements for water reuse systems, including storage
  material requirements; EPDM with ACS/WRAS certification satisfies material requirements
- REH / RCCTE: national building energy regulation encourages water efficiency measures;
  rainwater harvesting is accredited in the Water Performance Certificate
- LNEC E 452: the key technical reference for domestic rainwater harvesting design in
  Portugal; Membriko's dimensioning methodology follows this specification
- Municipal incentives: several municipalities (Cascais, Silves, Tavira, Beja, Évora)
  offer financial incentives or reduced municipal water tariffs for properties with
  certified rainwater harvesting systems

## Section 10: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Provide the complete data table for engineers and specifiers.

**Content:** Full technical data table.

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard cistern) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (structural slab loading) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |

## Section 11: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Reassure the reader that an EPDM cistern requires minimal ongoing attention.

**Content:**
- Routine maintenance: visual inspection annually; check inlet filter and first-flush
  diverter; check pump operation and level sensor; inspect penetration points (inlet,
  overflow, pump access) for any sign of seepage
- Cistern cleaning: every 3-5 years, drain cistern, wash EPDM surfaces with dilute
  hypochlorite solution (1-2% NaOCl), rinse with clean water; EPDM is fully compatible
  with hypochlorite at any cleaning concentration
- Sediment accumulation: fine sediment accumulates on the cistern floor regardless of
  filtration; periodic removal prevents bacterial activity; a submersible pump with an
  elevated foot valve avoids pumping settled sediment into distribution
- What to avoid: sharp tools near the membrane during cleaning; abrasive cleaning
  methods that could scratch the surface; very high-pressure jetting directed at seams
  or penetration details (general washing is fine)
- Repair: EPDM patches can be applied if mechanical damage occurs; Membriko provides
  a repair kit with each installation and can perform any warranted repair

---

## Section 12: Sustainability and Water Footprint

**Purpose:** Contextualise the environmental value of rainwater harvesting with Portuguese
data; connect Membriko's material choice to environmental credentials.

**Content:**
- Portugal's water stress index: Portugal has a Medium-High water stress classification
  (WRI Aqueduct) in southern regions; the Sado, Mira, and Arade river basins have
  annual withdrawal exceeding 60% of available renewable water resources
- Carbon footprint of mains water: water treatment and distribution in Portugal consumes
  approximately 0.3-0.5 kWh/m³ (including pumping, treatment, and distribution losses);
  each cubic metre of harvested rainwater substituted avoids approximately 0.12-0.20 kg
  CO₂-equivalent at Portugal's electricity grid carbon intensity
- Embodied carbon of EPDM: a 1.5 mm EPDM liner for a 20,000-litre cistern (≈ 75 kg
  of EPDM) has an embodied carbon footprint of approximately 250-350 kg CO₂-equivalent;
  annualised over 50 years, this is 5-7 kg CO₂-equivalent per year — offset within the
  first year of operation by water conservation benefits
- EPDM recyclability: at end of service life, EPDM can be mechanically recycled into
  crumb rubber for acoustic insulation, play surfaces, and asphalt modification; no
  landfill disposal required

---

## Section 13: Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Purpose:** Give the reader a financial framework to evaluate the investment. Be specific
and honest about payback periods.

**Content:**
- Indicative installed cost of an EPDM-lined cistern (2024 pricing, Portugal):
  - 10,000 litres underground cistern: €4,000-7,000 including excavation, liner, lid,
    penetrations (pump and distribution sold separately)
  - 25,000 litres underground cistern: €8,000-14,000
  - 50,000 litres agricultural reservoir (open, above-ground earthwork): €6,000-11,000
  - 100,000 litres agricultural reservoir: €12,000-20,000
- Mains water cost savings:
  - Residential tariff: average residential water tariff in Portugal: €0.80-1.50/m³
    (varying significantly by municipality, concession, and tier)
  - Agricultural tariff (EDIA in Alqueva zone): €0.15-0.35/m³ for irrigation water
  - A household harvesting 20,000 litres/year substituting mains water at €1.20/m³
    saves €24/year in water costs (supplemented by avoided wastewater tariff on
    non-potable uses: €24-36/year additional saving)
- Simple payback calculation: simple payback at household scale is long (30-60 years for
  a 10,000-litre cistern serving toilet flushing only). The investment case is stronger
  when combined with: agricultural or large garden irrigation (high-volume savings);
  security of supply value in drought years; property value enhancement
- The value of security of supply: in the Alentejo in 2022 and 2023, several municipal
  water systems imposed restrictions on garden irrigation and non-essential uses during
  summer months. Properties with cisterns were unaffected. The insurance value of
  water storage is real and increasingly tangible.
- Note on Alqueva irrigation system: properties in the Alqueva command area with access
  to EDIA irrigation water at low tariffs have a different cost structure; Membriko has
  experience lining irrigation reservoirs and canals in this context

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and pre-empt the most common buyer questions.

1. **Posso usar a água da cisterna EPDM para beber?**
   Harvested rainwater stored in an EPDM cistern is not potable without full treatment
   (filtration, disinfection, quality testing). For household drinking water, mains or
   borehole water is the correct source. Rainwater from a properly maintained EPDM
   cistern is suitable for toilet flushing, garden irrigation, car washing, and in many
   cases for livestock watering and food garden irrigation.

2. **Qual o volume mínimo e máximo de cisterna que a Membriko executa?**
   Membriko executes EPDM cisterns from 2,000 litres (small domestic) to several million
   litres (agricultural reservoirs). There is no practical upper limit — the EPDM
   membrane is available in widths up to 15.25 m and is seamed in the field for any area.

3. **O EPDM aguenta o peso de um carro ou tractor por cima da cisterna enterrada?**
   If the cistern structural lid is designed to carry vehicular loading, the lid design
   (concrete, steel or composite) must be engineered for that load. The EPDM membrane
   under the structural lid does not bear direct vehicular load. If the cistern is below
   a driveway, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM (vs 1.5 mm standard) and recommends a
   reinforced concrete lid with engineer-certified slab thickness.

4. **Quanto tempo dura uma cisterna EPDM sem manutenção?**
   An EPDM-lined cistern correctly installed requires only routine inspection and cleaning
   every 3-5 years. The EPDM membrane itself requires no maintenance interventions — no
   recoating, no resealing, no replacement. The projected service life exceeds 50 years.
   Pump and filter components (mechanical and electrical) require periodic servicing per
   manufacturer specifications.

5. **O EPDM afecta a qualidade da água armazenada?**
   EPDM certified to ACS and WRAS standards has been tested to confirm that it does not
   migrate plasticisers, biocides, or other compounds into stored water in quantities that
   impair water quality for its intended non-potable uses. It is chemically more inert
   than any alternative liner material. For irrigation use, there are no known effects
   of EPDM-lined cistern water on soil chemistry or plant health.

6. **Posso instalar uma cisterna EPDM numa estrutura existente de betão antiga?**
   Yes. Many existing concrete cisterns in Portugal (some with centuries of use) can be
   renovated by installing an EPDM membrane inside the structure, eliminating leakage
   without demolition. The existing concrete structure provides the structural shell; the
   EPDM provides the watertight lining. Membriko prepares the concrete surface and installs
   the liner in a process similar to a new-build cistern.

7. **Qual a diferença entre cisterna EPDM e cisterna com tinta ou argamassa de impermeabilização?**
   Cementitious or bituminous waterproofing mortars and coatings applied inside concrete
   cisterns are rigid systems with zero crack-bridging capability: any movement of the
   concrete substrate cracks the coating. They also require reapplication every 5-15 years
   as the coating carbonates, blisters, or loses adhesion. EPDM bridges cracks up to several
   millimetres without compromise and has no recoating requirement for 50+ years.

8. **A Membriko inclui o dimensionamento e o projecto no serviço?**
   Yes. The Membriko service includes the technical visit, the sizing calculation (following
   LNEC E 452 methodology), the system specification (including first-flush diverter, pump
   selection and distribution), and the installation with 20-year warranty. Membriko does
   not sell only the membrane — it delivers a complete, warranted cistern solution.
