# Rainwater Harvesting with EPDM Membrane

## Water That Falls and Water That Stays — The Cistern as Infrastructure

In August in the Alentejo, the rivers have been dry for months. The springs stopped flowing
in April. Boreholes are lower than they have ever been. The local authority has issued water
restriction guidance. And the farmer with a cistern passes through that summer without
anxiety.

Rainwater harvesting is not a new concept in Portugal. The stone cisterns of the Alentejo
quintas and the Algarve farm estates have been collecting winter rain for summer use for
centuries. What has changed is the scale of water stress — worsening year by year — and
the quality of the materials available for building the storage. EPDM membrane represents
a technical step-change over everything that came before it: lime mortar, cement render,
epoxy coatings. These materials crack. EPDM does not.

Membriko, based in Pombal in central Portugal, waterproofs rainwater cisterns and reservoirs
exclusively with EPDM membrane. Not as an alternative to the cistern tradition — as its
modern continuation, with a material that delivers watertight performance for over 50 years
without recoating, without cracking, without replacement. Membriko does not sell membrane
by the roll: it delivers a complete, sized, warranted cistern solution for every property
and scale, from a 5,000-litre residential installation to a 500,000-litre agricultural
reservoir.

Portugal's rainfall is profoundly unequal. The Minho in the far northwest receives up to
3,000 mm per year. The Alentejo interior receives under 500 mm, concentrated in five months.
This is not merely a quantitative difference — it is a strategic reality for every rural and
peri-urban property owner in the southern two-thirds of the country. A correctly sized and
correctly installed cistern changes that reality permanently.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Material for Rainwater Storage

Membriko's technical case for EPDM in rainwater cisterns is rooted in chemistry and
engineering data. The choice is not commercial — it is the result of comparing every
available liner material against the actual demands of long-term water storage.

### What a Rainwater Cistern Demands from Its Lining

A rainwater cistern exposes its lining to conditions that most waterproofing materials cannot
sustain permanently:

- **Continuous contact with slightly acidic water:** rainwater typically has a pH between
  5.5 and 7.0, depending on dissolved CO₂ and local atmospheric conditions. Cementitious
  and bituminous coatings progressively carbonate in contact with this slightly acidic water,
  losing strength and developing micro-cracks over years.
- **Fill and empty cycles:** a working cistern moves from near-full in March to near-empty
  in September. These cycles create differential stress in the structure as hydrostatic load
  and water temperature vary.
- **Substrate movement:** concrete shrinks during its first years of service; ground settles;
  seasonal thermal cycles expand and contract the structure. Any rigid coating that cracks
  in these movements loses watertightness.
- **UV exposure:** above-ground cisterns and at-waterline surfaces in partially buried tanks
  receive direct ultraviolet radiation. Most flexible liner materials — PVC, standard
  polyethylene — degrade from UV exposure within 10-15 years.

### The Chemistry of EPDM Addresses Every Failure Mode

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic rubber elastomer whose main polymer
chain consists exclusively of single carbon-carbon bonds. This saturated molecular architecture
gives EPDM properties that no rigid coating can match:

**400% elongation at break:** the EPDM membrane accommodates substrate movements of several
millimetres without losing watertightness. A crack in the cistern's concrete wall that opens
3 mm over the years is absorbed by the membrane without creating any pathway for water. A
cementitious waterproofing coating cracks at 0.3 mm of movement.

**No plasticisers — nothing to migrate:** unlike PVC liner, EPDM contains no plasticisers.
Its flexibility is intrinsic to the vulcanised elastomer structure, requiring no additives
that can leach into stored water. Membriko specifies only WRAS and ACS-certified EPDM for
all cisterns where water will be used for domestic or agricultural purposes.

**Intrinsic UV stability:** the carbon black incorporated in the EPDM formulation (25-35
parts per hundred) absorbs UV radiation before it can attack the polymer chain. No UV
stabiliser additives are required that would deplete over time. The EPDM membrane installed
by Membriko in an above-ground cistern in 2025 will have the same UV resistance in 2075.

**Chemical compatibility with rainwater:** the pH range that EPDM tolerates without any
degradation is 4 to 12 — far beyond the chemistry of any natural rainwater. Membriko draws
on ASTM D471 immersion test data (conducted at pH 4.5 and 70°C, equivalent by Arrhenius
projection to decades of real-temperature exposure) to demonstrate that the membrane's
mechanical properties do not change in prolonged contact with acidic water.

## System Types — Underground, Above-Ground, and Integrated

Membriko installs EPDM cisterns in three primary configurations, each suited to different
site conditions and operational requirements.

### Underground Cisterns

The underground cistern is the optimum configuration for hot climates. Ground temperature
in Portugal at 1.5 to 2.0 metres depth remains between 14°C and 18°C throughout the year.
This stable, cool temperature suppresses biological activity in stored water, eliminates
evaporation losses, and maintains water quality through the long summer storage period.

Construction is straightforward: a volume is excavated in the ground (or an existing masonry
or concrete structure is used); walls and floor are finished with cement mortar render;
EPDM membrane is installed over the entire internal surface; a concrete lid or prefabricated
cover with access hatch is installed above. Membriko sizes underground cisterns from 2,000
litres for compact domestic installations to 200,000 litres and beyond for agricultural
reservoirs.

The traditional stone cisterns of the Alentejo and Algarve are precisely this configuration,
developed over centuries because it works. Membriko brings it into the 21st century with
an EPDM liner that replaces the lime mortar or cement render that has always been the
weakness in those historic structures.

For sites with a high water table — common in the low-lying areas of the Alentejo and
along the Algarve coastal strip — Membriko accounts for external hydrostatic pressure in
the structural design. A cistern that may be empty when the water table is high is at risk
of flotation uplift: this structural consideration is addressed in the engineering design
of the cover slab and perimeter walls, not by the EPDM membrane.

### Above-Ground Cisterns

Where excavation is not possible — rock substrate, high water table, constrained access —
or where gravity distribution from an elevated position is operationally advantageous,
Membriko installs above-ground cisterns.

The support structure may be concrete block masonry, stone, treated timber framing, or
hot-dip galvanised steel sections. Membriko works with whatever structural solution the
client or their civil contractor provides. The EPDM membrane waterproofs the interior,
with a perimeter termination rail at the top edge.

The critical advantage of EPDM for above-ground cisterns is UV stability without any
protective covering over the membrane itself. PVC and standard polyethylene degrade from
direct UV exposure within 10 to 15 years — surface chalking, embrittlement, and eventually
perforation are the predictable failure modes. EPDM remains stable indefinitely in direct
UV exposure. Membriko has replaced failed PVC liners in above-ground cisterns across the
Alentejo and Algarve where the original installation had already failed before the 10-year
mark.

Above-ground cisterns positioned at elevation relative to the irrigation area allow gravity
distribution without a pump — reducing operational energy costs for agricultural installations
where irrigation is the primary use.

### Integrated Cisterns below Paved Surfaces

The most space-efficient configuration for urban and peri-urban properties is the integrated
cistern installed beneath a terrace, driveway, garden, or other external paved surface. The
storage volume is created below finished ground level without consuming any usable surface
area.

Construction involves a reinforced concrete structure designed to carry the loads imposed
by the surface above — pedestrian, vehicular, or planted — with EPDM membrane lining the
interior. Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for cisterns beneath trafficked surfaces and works
with the civil engineer to ensure the cover slab is designed for the correct loads.

This configuration is particularly effective in urban properties where external space is
limited: a terrace or driveway can conceal a 10,000 to 50,000-litre cistern with no visible
footprint, connected directly to the roof drainage system of the building.

## Water Quality and EPDM Safety for Stored Rainwater

The most common concern Membriko encounters when advising agricultural and domestic clients
on EPDM cisterns is: "Will a rubber liner affect the quality of my water?" It is a legitimate
question with a clear technical answer.

### What EPDM Does — and Does Not — Contribute to Stored Water

The quality of harvested rainwater is determined by the quality of the incoming precipitation,
the cleanliness of the collection surfaces, and the liner material in contact with stored
water. EPDM is the liner choice that contributes least to stored water chemistry, for three
reasons:

**No plasticisers:** PVC liner — widely used in agricultural cisterns across Portugal —
contains 20 to 40% by weight of plasticisers (phthalates or adipates) that migrate
progressively into stored water, particularly at elevated temperatures. In an above-ground
PVC-lined cistern in the Alentejo summer, with surface temperatures reaching 50 to 60°C,
plasticiser migration into stored water is significant and cumulative. EPDM contains no
plasticisers. Its flexibility is intrinsic to the vulcanised elastomer structure and requires
no additives that migrate.

**No biocides or antimicrobial additives:** some HDPE liners incorporate silver-based or
triclosan-based antimicrobial compounds to suppress biofilm growth on the liner surface.
These compounds migrate into stored water and may have ecological effects when the water
is used for irrigation. EPDM does not incorporate antimicrobial additives.

**Minimal organic compound extraction confirmed by certification:** EPDM certified to WRAS
(Water Regulations Advisory Scheme, BS 6920) and ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire,
France) has been tested for extraction of organic compounds, metals, and biological agents
into water at temperatures up to 60°C. Results confirm that extraction is below detection
limits for all tested compounds. Membriko specifies only WRAS and ACS-certified EPDM for
all cisterns where water will be used for domestic or food-production agricultural purposes.

### Biofilm in EPDM Cisterns

All surfaces in contact with non-disinfected water develop biofilm over time — a thin
community of aerobic bacteria and associated microorganisms. This is a universal feature
of any cistern not continuously dosed with biocide, irrespective of the liner material.
It is not caused or accelerated by the EPDM membrane.

Biofilm management in EPDM cisterns is straightforward: every three to five years, drain
the cistern and wash the EPDM surfaces with a 1-2% sodium hypochlorite solution, followed
by clean-water rinsing. EPDM is chemically resistant to sodium hypochlorite at any
concentration used for cistern hygiene — there is no risk of membrane damage from periodic
disinfection cleaning.

## The Membriko Installation Process

Membriko follows a systematic, documented installation process that eliminates the most
common causes of premature failure in cistern waterproofing. Every step has a specific
technical purpose.

### Step 1: Survey and Sizing

Membriko conducts a free technical site visit before any quotation. This visit is a
structured technical assessment, not a commercial call. It covers:

- Measurement of available collection surfaces (roof area, terraces, courtyards, farm
  buildings): the collection area that will feed the cistern
- Characterisation of local rainfall (using SNIRH historical series for the nearest
  monitoring station): the rainfall resource that fills the cistern
- Assessment of non-potable water demand: toilet flushing, garden and orchard irrigation,
  vehicle washing, livestock watering, agricultural uses
- Sizing calculation following the LNEC E 452 methodology (Portugal's primary technical
  reference for domestic rainwater harvesting design)
- Site assessment for cistern construction: ground conditions, water table depth, rock,
  access for excavation equipment, integration points with existing drainage
- Identification of first-flush diverter requirements and pump/distribution system

The report from this visit forms the basis of Membriko's technical proposal. The client
receives a document specifying the recommended cistern volume, configuration, EPDM
specification, and system components.

### Step 2: Solution Design

Based on the sizing assessment, Membriko prepares the complete system design:

- Cistern geometry and volume, adapted to available space and ground conditions
- EPDM membrane specification: 1.5 mm standard or 2.0 mm for vehicular loading; ACS/WRAS
  certification for domestic and food-production use
- Membrane cut plan: optimised to minimise seams; for cisterns narrower than 15.25 m,
  a single panel on the floor is often achievable without any submerged seam
- EPDM penetration fittings for all inlet, overflow, and pump access points
- Collection system specification: first-flush diverter, gutters, downpipes
- Extraction and distribution system: submersible pump, pressure vessel, non-potable
  distribution network

### Step 3: Structure Preparation

Preparation of the cistern structure is the step that most determines the longevity of the
membrane installation. Membriko applies the same rigour to this stage as to the membrane
installation itself.

For new underground cisterns excavated in earth:
- Excavated surfaces regularised; stones, roots, and sharp edges removed
- Floor and walls finished with cement mortar render (minimum 30 mm thickness), creating
  a smooth surface without protrusions
- Minimum curing time: 7 days before membrane installation

For existing masonry or concrete cisterns:
- High-pressure water jetting to remove biological deposits, efflorescence, and loose
  material
- Crack repair with epoxy or hydro-expanding polyurethane mortar for active cracks
- Surface regularisation to eliminate sharp edges, protrusions, and surface variations
  greater than 5 mm
- Minimum 48 hours drying after cleaning before membrane installation proceeds

### Step 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Installation begins at the cistern floor with the largest panel. The EPDM membrane is
bonded to the prepared surface with an immersion-rated contact adhesive — the same adhesive
specification used in Membriko's swimming pool installations, certified for water contact
at pH 4-12 and temperatures up to 60°C.

Full-surface adhesive bonding (fully bonded method) is used throughout, eliminating any
air pocket between membrane and structure that could create differential pressure during
water level changes. Walls are lined after the floor, with a 100 mm overlap onto the floor
panel, bonded with 150 mm QuickSeam tape.

All internal corners — where floor meets wall, and wall meets wall — receive pre-formed
EPDM corner pieces (cantarias) that create a continuous, stress-free transition. Cutting
corners directly from flat membrane creates stress concentration points that may crack over
time under repeated hydrostatic loading. Membriko does not take this shortcut.

### Step 5: Seams and Penetration Details

All panel-to-panel seams are bonded with QuickPrime Plus primer and 150 mm QuickSeam tape,
applied with uniform pressure using a silicone roller. After curing, every seam is tested
with a metal probe — any lack of adhesion is immediately corrected before proceeding.

Penetration details — inlet pipe, overflow pipe, pump access, water level sensor cable —
are sealed with EPDM-specific flanged compression fittings that create a mechanical and
chemical seal between the membrane and the penetrating element. Membriko does not use
silicone or mastic as the primary seal at any penetration point — only EPDM-certified
fittings rated for permanent immersion service.

### Step 6: Perimeter Termination

At the top of the cistern wall, where the membrane terminates before the cover slab or
structure edge, the membrane is secured with an anodised aluminium or stainless steel
termination rail mechanically fixed with stainless expansion anchors. This rail protects
the upper membrane edge from mechanical damage and prevents capillary ingress between the
membrane and the structure at the termination point.

For buried cisterns, Membriko raises the termination rail at least 150 mm above external
ground level, to protect against surface runoff entering the cistern between membrane and
cover.

### Step 7: Cover and Collection System Connection

The cistern cover — concrete slab, prefabricated concrete lids, or treated timber panels
— is installed after the membrane. Membriko coordinates with the civil contractor to ensure
that access hatches, pipe penetrations, and slab supports are compatible with the membrane
penetration details already installed.

Connection to the collection system (gutters, downpipes, first-flush diverter) is completed
by Membriko or in coordination with the drainage contractor. Membriko recommends first-flush
diverters on all systems serving domestic or food-production agricultural uses, sized to
divert the first 1.5 mm of precipitation per m² of collection area.

### Step 8: Watertightness Test and Warranty

After full installation of the membrane and all accessories, Membriko fills the cistern
gradually to 70-80% capacity and monitors the water level for 72 hours. Any level drop
beyond normal evaporation (in open cisterns) triggers a full inspection of all penetrations
and seams. The fill test is documented photographically.

The Membriko 20-year installation warranty certificate is issued at project handover,
together with the quality inspection report, photographic as-built record, and the EPDM
cistern maintenance guide.

## Sizing for Portuguese Rainfall Conditions

Membriko sizes every cistern using the LNEC E 452 methodology, adapted to the SNIRH
historical precipitation series for the specific project location. This approach ensures
that cistern volume is matched to actual local rainfall patterns and the client's real
water demand profile.

### The Collection Formula

Annual collectible volume is calculated as:

**V = A × P × C × E**

Where:
- **V** = collectible volume per year (litres)
- **A** = collection area (m²) — sum of roof and impermeable surface areas draining to
  the cistern
- **P** = annual precipitation (mm) — from the SNIRH historical series for the nearest
  monitoring station
- **C** = runoff coefficient (dimensionless)
- **E** = system efficiency factor (accounts for first-flush diverter losses, evaporation,
  and collection inefficiencies)

### Runoff Coefficients by Surface Type

| Surface Type | Runoff Coefficient (C) |
|---|---|
| Traditional clay tile roof | 0.80 – 0.88 |
| Fibre-cement or concrete roof | 0.85 – 0.92 |
| Flat concrete terrace or paving | 0.85 – 0.95 |
| Compacted gravel surface | 0.20 – 0.35 |
| Lawn or planted surface | 0.10 – 0.20 |

### Worked Examples from Portuguese Conditions

**Residential property in Évora (average annual rainfall: 550 mm)**
- Collection area: 180 m² roof + 60 m² terrace = 240 m²
- Weighted runoff coefficient: 0.85
- System efficiency: 0.90
- Annual collectible volume: 240 × 550 × 0.85 × 0.90 = **101,100 litres/year**
- Estimated non-potable demand (family of 4): toilet flushing (180 dry-period days at 50
  L/person/day) + garden irrigation (80 m²) = approximately 36,000 + 24,000 = ~60,000 litres
- Recommended cistern volume (15-25% of annual collectible): **15,000 to 25,000 litres**

**Agricultural property in the Alentejo (average annual rainfall: 520 mm)**
- Collection area: farmhouse + farm buildings = 400 m² of roof
- Runoff coefficient: 0.87 (tile)
- System efficiency: 0.90
- Annual collectible volume: 400 × 520 × 0.87 × 0.90 = **162,864 litres/year**
- Estimated irrigation demand: 500 m² orchard + 200 m² kitchen garden in summer = ~120,000
  litres
- Recommended cistern volume: **30,000 to 50,000 litres** to bridge the dry season

**Rural property in the Algarve (average annual rainfall: 480 mm)**
- Collection area: house 120 m² + outbuildings 80 m² = 200 m²
- Annual collectible volume: 200 × 480 × 0.87 × 0.90 = **75,168 litres/year**
- Recommended cistern volume: **15,000 to 20,000 litres** for domestic non-potable use and
  garden irrigation

### Non-Potable Water Demand Reference Values

| Use | Reference Consumption |
|---|---|
| Toilet flushing (per person/day) | 35 – 50 litres |
| Garden irrigation (per m²/day, summer) | 2 – 8 litres depending on plant type and climate |
| Orchard irrigation (per m²/year) | 200 – 600 litres |
| Vehicle washing | 150 – 250 litres/event |
| External paving cleaning | 5 – 15 litres/m² |
| Livestock watering (cattle/day) | 50 – 100 litres |

## Integration with Building Water Systems

A Membriko EPDM cistern is a complete water harvesting system, not merely a lined tank.
Membriko designs and — where the client requires — installs the full system integration.

### First-Flush Diverter

The first-flush diverter is an essential component for any cistern serving domestic or
food-production agricultural uses. The first 1 to 2 mm of each rainfall event washes
collection surfaces, carrying dust, bird droppings, zinc residues from galvanised gutters,
and accumulated organic material. This first fraction of every rainfall event should be
diverted to drainage before the remainder enters the cistern.

Membriko recommends automatic diverters sized to divert the equivalent of 1.5 mm of
precipitation per m² of collection area. The diverter self-drains between rainfall events,
resetting automatically for the next storm. For a property with 200 m² of collection area,
the diversion volume is 1.5 × 200 = 300 litres per event.

### Cistern Inlet Design

The inlet pipe should discharge below the cistern's minimum water level, through a calming
diffuser that dissipates the kinetic energy of incoming water and prevents resuspension of
settled sediment. Membriko installs inlet penetrations as EPDM flanged fittings — fully
sealed mechanical connections, not pipes simply passed through a hole in the membrane.

### Overflow Management

The overflow outlet is sized for the peak inflow from the most intense rainfall event the
cistern is likely to receive — typically calculated for the 10-year return-period, 15-minute
rainfall intensity at the project location. The overflow pipe discharges to the property's
surface drainage, a soakaway, or an infiltration trench. All overflow penetrations in
Membriko cisterns are sealed EPDM fittings, not loose pipe entries.

### Extraction and Distribution System

Membriko advises on and, where required, supplies the extraction system:

- **Submersible pump:** selected for cistern depth and distribution head; pump foot valve
  positioned 20-30 cm above the cistern floor to avoid drawing up settled sediment
- **Pressure vessel:** maintains distribution pressure without continuous pump cycling,
  extending pump service life and reducing energy consumption
- **Level sensor and controller:** activates and stops the pump; signals low-water
  condition to prevent dry running
- **Non-potable distribution network:** pipes marked in dark blue or with identification
  tape, physically separated from the potable water supply — a regulatory requirement
  under NP EN 1717 and Portaria 23/2021

### Treatment for Indoor Non-Potable Use

For cistern water used in toilet cisterns and washing machines (indoor non-potable uses),
Membriko recommends:

- **Sediment pre-filter:** 50-100 micron cartridge filter at the pump outlet; cartridge
  replacement every 6-12 months depending on water turbidity
- **UV-C disinfection:** in-line UV lamp ensuring microbiologically safe water for indoor
  use without adding chemicals; the most widely used treatment in Portuguese rainwater
  harvesting installations
- **Activated carbon filter (optional):** for odour control and dissolved organic compound
  reduction

## EPDM vs Concrete / HDPE / Prefabricated Tanks / GRP

Membriko presents this comparison with the honesty it applies to all client conversations.
Prefabricated HDPE tanks are a valid solution for some applications. The comparison below
identifies where each technology is appropriate, and where EPDM is the clear choice.

| Feature | EPDM Liner (Membriko) | Concrete Cistern | HDPE/PP Tank | GRP/Polyester Tank |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Custom volume | Any volume — built in situ | High cost for large volumes | Limited to catalogue sizes | Medium volumes; transport limits |
| Service life | 50+ years | 30-50 years (with coating) | 15-25 years (above ground) | 20-30 years (gel coat) |
| Plasticisers in stored water | None | None | None (HDPE) | None |
| UV resistance above ground | Excellent — intrinsic | N/A | Poor — requires shading | Moderate — gel coat degrades |
| Crack bridging capability | Excellent — 400% elongation | None — rigid | N/A | None — brittle |
| Geometric flexibility | Any shape — in situ construction | Fixed after formwork | Fixed catalogue shape | Fixed catalogue shape |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 140 (recoating) | 160 (replacement) | 130 (gel coat) |

Honest assessment: prefabricated HDPE tanks below 5,000 litres with unconstrained site
access are often the lowest-cost and fastest-to-install solution. Membriko does not compete
in that segment. EPDM becomes the clear technical choice when:

- Volume required exceeds 10,000 litres (above this threshold, EPDM installed in situ is
  cost-competitive with or below the cost of multiple prefabricated tanks plus delivery
  and installation)
- Site geometry does not accommodate prefabricated tank installation
- The cistern is above ground with direct UV exposure (HDPE fails; EPDM does not)
- The cistern is an existing masonry or concrete structure requiring internal waterproofing
- The application is agricultural — open reservoirs, irrigation ponds, retention basins
  where only in-situ installed membranes are practically feasible

## Portuguese Regulations — DL 236/98, DL 119/2021, and Water Reuse

Membriko understands the Portuguese and EU regulatory framework governing rainwater
collection, storage, and reuse, and ensures that all installations are compliant with
applicable legislation.

### Decreto-Lei 236/98 — Water Quality Standards

DL 236/98 establishes water quality criteria for various uses, including agricultural
irrigation (Annex XVI). Rainwater collected from clean roof and terrace surfaces and stored
in an EPDM cistern generally satisfies the Annex XVI parameters for irrigation of non-food
crops and green space irrigation without specific treatment — provided the collection surface
is not contaminated by biocidal roof treatments or industrial atmospheric deposits.

For irrigation of vegetables or fruit intended for direct human consumption, Membriko
recommends periodic water quality analysis from the cistern to confirm compliance with the
DL 236/98 Class A irrigation parameters.

### Decreto-Lei 119/2021 — Water Reuse Framework

DL 119/2021 transposes EU Regulation 2020/741 on minimum requirements for water reuse into
Portuguese law. It establishes four water quality classes (A, B, C, D) for reclaimed water,
with progressive microbiological and physico-chemical requirements.

Harvested rainwater used for toilet flushing and private garden irrigation falls outside
the strict scope of this decree (which applies to treatment systems for reclaimed municipal
wastewater), but its quality parameters provide a useful technical benchmark. The use of
a first-flush diverter and UV-C disinfection brings cistern water to characteristics
compatible with Class C or B for most common domestic non-potable purposes.

### Portaria 23/2021 — Technical Requirements for Water Reuse Systems

Portaria 23/2021 defines technical requirements for collection, storage, and distribution
systems for reclaimed water used in buildings. It requires that storage systems must:

- Be watertight and constructed of materials that do not impair water quality
- Be covered or protected from external contamination
- Have a distribution network physically separated from the potable water supply (NP EN 1717)
- Be identified as "Non-Potable Water" at all consumption points

EPDM membrane certified to ACS/WRAS satisfies the material requirement of not impairing
water quality. Membriko provides certification documentation for each installation serving
regulated domestic non-potable uses.

### LNEC E 452 — Technical Reference for Sizing

The LNEC E 452 specification (Captação e Utilização de Água de Chuva em Edifícios —
Collection and Use of Rainwater in Buildings) is the primary technical reference in Portugal
for domestic rainwater harvesting system design. It defines the sizing methodology, water
quality requirements by intended use, collection and storage system specifications, and
maintenance criteria.

Membriko uses LNEC E 452 as the basis for all domestic and agricultural cistern sizing,
adapted to the SNIRH historical precipitation data for each project's specific location.

### Municipal Incentive Programmes

Several Portuguese municipalities operate financial incentive programmes for rainwater
harvesting systems, including Cascais, Silves, Tavira, Beja, Évora, and municipalities
within the Associação dos Municípios do Alentejo. Common incentives include reduced
sanitation tariffs for properties with certified rainwater systems, partial capital grants,
and simplified licensing procedures. Membriko advises clients on the programmes available
in their municipality before project initiation.

## Maintenance of EPDM Cisterns

One of the most practical advantages of a Membriko cistern is the near-absence of membrane-
specific maintenance requirements. Unlike concrete cisterns (which require periodic internal
recoating), EPDM cisterns have no liner maintenance requirement beyond visual inspection
and periodic cleaning.

### Routine Annual Maintenance

**Pre-season inspection (before the rainy season, typically October):**
- Visual inspection of accessible membrane surfaces: look for any signs of lifting, bubbling,
  or separation from the substrate at wall-floor junctions and corner details
- Inspection of all penetration fittings (inlet, overflow, pump access): confirm no damp
  marks outside the compression ring that might indicate seepage
- First-flush diverter: clean the diversion reservoir and verify the mechanism operates
  correctly
- Sediment pre-filter: replace the cartridge if flow rate has noticeably decreased
- Sediment level check: look through the access hatch to assess floor sediment accumulation

**Mechanical system maintenance:**
- Submersible pump: annual flow rate and pressure check; manufacturer's service schedule
  for seal and bearing replacement (typically 5-10 years)
- UV-C lamp: annual replacement (UV lamps lose germicidal effectiveness before they fail
  visibly)
- Level sensor: function test before the rainy season

### Cistern Cleaning (Every 3-5 Years)

Membriko recommends draining and cleaning the cistern every three to five years to remove
accumulated sediment and disinfect the surfaces. The process is uncomplicated:

1. Empty the cistern using the submersible pump
2. Remove floor sediment manually with a plastic (never metal) shovel
3. Wash EPDM surfaces with 1-2% sodium hypochlorite solution (equivalent to domestic
   bleach diluted 1:5 in water)
4. Rinse with clean water until rinse water reaches pH 7.0-7.5
5. Visually inspect the entire membrane during cleaning; any irregularities should be
   reported to Membriko
6. Refill gradually and monitor water level for 24 hours before returning to normal use

EPDM is chemically resistant to sodium hypochlorite at any concentration used for cistern
hygiene. This cleaning product does not alter the membrane's mechanical properties or
watertightness.

### Repair (in Case of Mechanical Damage)

If the membrane sustains mechanical damage — a puncture from a tool, or an object dropped
during maintenance — repair is straightforward:

- Lower the water level below the damage point
- Clean and dry the affected area (minimum 24 hours of drying)
- Apply an EPDM patch of the same thickness, bonded with QuickSeam tape (minimum patch
  dimensions: 150 × 150 mm, or 75 mm beyond the damage in all directions)
- Allow 24 hours curing time before refilling

Membriko supplies an emergency repair kit with every cistern installation. Repairs covered
by the 20-year installation warranty (damage not attributable to the client) are completed
free of charge.

## Sustainability and Water Footprint

The EPDM cistern installed by Membriko is not only an engineering solution — it is a
practical response to one of the most pressing resource pressures facing Portuguese property
owners and farmers.

### Portugal's Water Stress Reality

Portugal has a Medium-High water stress classification in southern regions (WRI Aqueduct
2023). The Sado, Mira, and Arade river basins have annual water withdrawals exceeding 60%
of available renewable resources — a level defined as High stress. IPCC AR6 projections
for the Mediterranean region, including Portugal, indicate a further 10-20% reduction in
annual precipitation and increased drought frequency under intermediate emissions scenarios
by 2050.

In this context, a correctly sized rainwater cistern is not an efficiency measure — it is
a water security asset for the property.

### Carbon Footprint of Water Treatment and Distribution

Water treatment and distribution in Portugal consumes approximately 0.3-0.5 kWh per cubic
metre (including abstraction, treatment, pumping, and distribution network losses). At
Portugal's grid carbon intensity (approximately 0.20-0.25 kg CO₂-equivalent per kWh in
recent years, declining as renewables expand), each cubic metre of harvested rainwater
substituted for mains water avoids 0.06-0.12 kg CO₂-equivalent in treatment and distribution
energy.

A rural property in the Alentejo harvesting 50,000 litres per year avoids 3-6 kg CO₂-
equivalent per year in water treatment energy alone — in addition to the water cost saving.

### Embodied Carbon of the EPDM Liner

EPDM membrane has an embodied carbon footprint of approximately 3.5-4.5 kg CO₂-equivalent
per kilogram of product (published European LCA data, including raw material extraction,
polymerisation, and compounding). A 1.5 mm EPDM liner for a 20,000-litre cistern with
approximately 50 m² of lined surface area (75 kg of EPDM) carries an embodied carbon total
of approximately 260-340 kg CO₂-equivalent. Spread over 50 years of service life, this
is 5-7 kg CO₂-equivalent per year — offset many times over in the first year of operation
by the water conservation and energy savings delivered by the system.

### EPDM Recyclability

At the end of the cistern's service life — over 50 years from installation — the EPDM
membrane can be mechanically recycled into crumb rubber for use in sports surfaces, acoustic
insulation panels, and asphalt modification. This compares favourably with PVC liners
(chlorine content makes recycling difficult and expensive) and GRP tanks (effectively
non-recyclable in practice). The end-of-life recyclability of EPDM is a genuine and
demonstrable environmental advantage.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

Membriko presents the financial analysis of rainwater harvesting investments with honesty.
The simple payback period on domestic cisterns — measured solely by mains water tariff
savings — is long. The complete investment case is broader than that single metric.

### Indicative Installed Costs (2024-2025 Reference, Portugal)

| Cistern Type | Volume | Estimated Cost (installed) |
|---|---|---|
| Underground domestic cistern | 10,000 litres | €4,500 – €7,500 |
| Underground domestic cistern | 25,000 litres | €8,500 – €14,000 |
| Underground agricultural cistern | 50,000 litres | €14,000 – €22,000 |
| Open agricultural reservoir | 50,000 litres | €7,000 – €12,000 |
| Open agricultural reservoir | 100,000 litres | €13,000 – €22,000 |

These figures include EPDM membrane, penetration fittings, perimeter termination, basic
cover, and Membriko installation. They exclude: civil works for excavation or structural
construction, pump and distribution system (quoted separately), first-flush diverter, and
connection to the building distribution network.

### Water Cost Savings

| Municipality / Tariff Context | Monthly substitution | Annual saving |
|---|---|---|
| Lisbon metropolitan area (EPAL + municipal) | 1,000 litres/month | ~€18 |
| Algarve (concession average 2024) | 1,000 litres/month | ~€14.40 |
| Alentejo interior (municipal average) | 1,000 litres/month | ~€10.80 |
| Plus sewerage tariff avoided (30-50%) | — | +€4 to €9 additional |

For domestic use only (toilet flushing and garden irrigation), the annual saving for a
four-person household in central Portugal is typically €40-80 per year. Simple payback on
a €6,000 cistern is 75-150 years at domestic tariffs — clearly not a financially-driven
investment at household scale alone.

### The Value of Water Security

The full investment case includes factors that simple payback ignores:

**Drought years and supply restriction:** In 2022 and 2023, municipal water authorities
across the Algarve and Alentejo imposed restrictions on garden irrigation and non-essential
water use during summer months. Properties with cisterns were unaffected. The cost of water
insecurity for an agricultural property — lost crops, stressed orchards, failed irrigation
— can run to many thousands of euros in a single drought year. A cistern is insurance against
this loss.

**Agricultural use value:** For properties outside municipal mains supply that rely on
a borehole with submersible pump for irrigation, a rainwater cistern fed by roof collection
reduces borehole drawdown and pumping energy. At EDIA irrigation tariffs (the Alqueva system
in the Alentejo: €0.15-0.35/m³), a cistern harvesting 50,000 litres/year saves €7.50-17.50
in direct water cost — but the real saving is the reduction in borehole pump operating hours
and the extension of borehole service life.

**Property value:** On rural and agricultural properties in the Alentejo and Algarve, a
cistern with adequate capacity in good condition is a recognised value factor in the rural
property market. Buyers and valuers in water-stressed regions increasingly factor water
storage capacity into agricultural land and quinta valuations.

## Frequently Asked Questions about EPDM Rainwater Cisterns

**Can I drink water stored in an EPDM cistern?**

Harvested rainwater is not potable without full treatment — filtration, disinfection, and
quality testing. For drinking water, mains supply, a tested borehole, or a certified source
is the correct choice. Water from a properly maintained Membriko EPDM cistern is suitable
for toilet flushing, garden and orchard irrigation, vehicle washing, floor cleaning, and in
most cases for livestock watering. For irrigation of vegetables and fruit intended for direct
human consumption, Membriko recommends periodic microbiological and chemical analysis of the
cistern water.

**What is the minimum and maximum cistern volume Membriko installs?**

Membriko installs EPDM cisterns from 2,000 litres (compact domestic) to volumes exceeding
one million litres (agricultural and industrial reservoirs). There is no practical upper
limit — EPDM membrane is available in widths up to 15.25 m and is field-seamed for any
surface area. Volume is determined by what the client needs, not by what fits in a catalogue.

**Can a buried EPDM cistern support the weight of a vehicle above it?**

The vehicle load is borne by the structural cover slab of the cistern — not the EPDM membrane.
If the cistern is below a driveway or trafficked area, the cover slab must be designed by
a civil engineer for the relevant loads. Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM (rather than the
1.5 mm standard) for cisterns beneath trafficked surfaces, and recommends a civil engineering
review of the cover slab design. The membrane itself carries no structural load.

**How long does an EPDM cistern last without recoating or replacement?**

The projected service life of the EPDM membrane exceeds 50 years, based on accelerated
ageing studies (Arrhenius methodology) and field data from installations with over 40 years
of service in European water management applications. Unlike cementitious waterproofing
mortars and bituminous coatings, EPDM does not require periodic reapplication. The only
membrane-specific maintenance is visual inspection and cleaning with hypochlorite solution
every 3-5 years.

**Does EPDM affect the quality of stored rainwater?**

EPDM certified to ACS and WRAS standards has been tested to confirm that it does not
migrate plasticisers, biocides, or other organic compounds into stored water in quantities
that impair water quality for intended non-potable uses. It is the chemically most inert
liner material commercially available for cistern applications. For garden and orchard
irrigation, there are no known effects of EPDM-lined cistern water on soil chemistry or
plant health.

**Can Membriko line an existing old concrete or stone cistern?**

Yes. Many existing concrete and stone cisterns in Portugal — some of considerable age and
historic value — can be renovated by Membriko with an EPDM liner installed inside the
existing structure, eliminating leakage without demolition. The stone or concrete structure
provides the structural shell; the EPDM provides the watertight lining. Cistern renovation
with EPDM is one of Membriko's specialisms and typically costs a fraction of building a
new cistern of equivalent volume.

**What is the difference between EPDM waterproofing and cementitious mortar coatings?**

Cementitious or bituminous waterproofing mortars applied inside concrete cisterns are rigid
systems with near-zero crack-bridging capability: any movement in the concrete substrate
cracks the coating, immediately creating pathways for water loss. They require reapplication
every 5-15 years as they carbonate, blister, or lose adhesion. EPDM bridges substrate cracks
up to several millimetres without any compromise to watertightness, and has no reapplication
requirement for 50+ years. The total cost over a 50-year period — including installation,
periodic recoating, and the disruption of each recoating cycle — makes EPDM the lower-cost
solution despite a higher initial investment.

**Does Membriko's service include the sizing calculation and system design?**

Yes. The Membriko service includes the technical site visit, sizing calculation following
LNEC E 452 methodology, complete system specification (first-flush diverter, pump selection,
filtration and distribution design), and the full cistern installation with 20-year warranty.
Membriko does not supply membrane only — it delivers a complete, warranted rainwater
harvesting solution, sized to the specific conditions of each property.
