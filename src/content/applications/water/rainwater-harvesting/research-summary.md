# Rainwater Harvesting — EPDM Research Summary

## The Role of EPDM in Rainwater Storage Systems

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is technically well-suited to rainwater harvesting
applications because the material's core chemical properties align directly with the demands
of long-term water containment. Unlike concrete tanks (prone to cracking and carbonation),
HDPE tanks (limited in custom geometry and susceptible to UV degradation when above-ground),
and GRP/polyester vessels (osmotic blistering over 10-15 years), EPDM liners provide a
continuous, seam-minimised, flexible waterproofing layer over any substrate geometry.

The critical distinction in rainwater harvesting applications is that the stored water is not
chemically treated. This creates a fundamentally different material selection logic compared
to swimming pool applications: there is no chlorine to resist, but there is a greater concern
about the material's contribution to water chemistry — specifically whether the liner leaches
organic compounds, odour-producing substances, or biologically active molecules into stored
water. This is where EPDM's plasticiser-free composition becomes a decisive advantage.

Key technical parameters for EPDM in rainwater storage:
- Water absorption: < 1% by weight (ASTM D471) — the membrane does not swell or degrade
  from prolonged water contact
- Service temperature range: -45°C to +130°C — covers the full Portuguese climate range
  from winter frost (rare but possible in the interior highlands) to summer tank surface
  temperatures that can exceed 60°C in unshaded above-ground installations
- Elongation at break: 350-500% — accommodates ground settlement, concrete substrate cracking,
  and thermal expansion and contraction of large-volume tanks over multiple decades
- Tensile strength: 9-12 N/mm² — sufficient for the hydrostatic pressure of tanks up to
  several metres in depth without mechanical reinforcement of the membrane itself

## Portuguese Rainfall and Water Scarcity Context

Portugal has one of the most uneven rainfall distribution profiles in Western Europe. The
country spans two distinct climatic zones:

**Northern and central Portugal (north of the Tagus):**
Annual precipitation: 600-3,000 mm depending on altitude and proximity to Atlantic
High spatial variability: the Minho receives up to 3,000 mm/year; the Beira Interior
plateaus receive 500-700 mm/year
Seasonal pattern: predominantly autumn-winter rainfall (October-March), with summer dry
periods of 3-4 months

**Southern Portugal (south of the Tagus, including Alentejo and Algarve):**
Annual precipitation: 400-700 mm in Alentejo; 400-600 mm in Algarve
Seasonal concentration: 80-90% of annual rainfall in October-April
Summer drought: 5-6 consecutive months with near-zero rainfall
Increasing aridity: IPCC projections (AR6) suggest Mediterranean climate zones including
southern Portugal will experience 10-20% further precipitation reduction by 2050 under
intermediate emissions scenarios

The combination of high seasonal variability and increasing drought risk makes rainwater
harvesting a structurally important water management strategy for Portuguese property owners.
In the Alentejo, where ground-level cisterns (cisternas and açudes) have been used since
the Moorish occupation, rainwater harvesting is embedded in the agricultural culture. The
modern EPDM-lined cistern represents a technical evolution of this tradition.

**Concrete and hard surface runoff areas in Portugal:**
Runoff coefficients for typical Portuguese surfaces:
- Concrete or ceramic roof tiles: 0.75-0.90
- Flat concrete terrace: 0.85-0.95
- Gravel surface: 0.20-0.35
- Turfed areas: 0.10-0.20

A house in the Alentejo with 150 m² of roof area and 500 mm of annual rainfall generates
approximately 56,250-67,500 litres of collectible rainwater per year — sufficient, with
proper storage, to cover toilet flushing, garden irrigation and vehicle washing for a
four-person household throughout the dry summer months.

## Water Quality in Rainwater Harvested with EPDM Liners

The quality of harvested rainwater is determined by three main factors: atmospheric dust
and biological particles in precipitation, surface contamination from collection surfaces
(roofs, terraces), and the storage medium and liner material. EPDM is the liner choice
least likely to impair water quality for the following reasons:

**No plasticiser migration:** Plasticised PVC releases plasticisers (phthalates, adipates)
into stored water, particularly at elevated temperatures. At the moderate temperatures
typical of underground cisterns (12-18°C in Portuguese ground), migration is slow but
cumulative over years. For above-ground tanks in summer sun (surface temperatures 30-60°C),
plasticiser migration from PVC increases significantly. EPDM contains no plasticisers —
the material's flexibility is intrinsic to the vulcanised elastomer structure, requiring
no migrating additives.

**No biocide or antimicrobial agent migration:** Some HDPE liners incorporate antimicrobial
additives (typically silver-based or triclosan-based compounds) to suppress biofilm growth
on the liner surface. These compounds migrate into stored water and may have ecological
effects downstream. EPDM does not incorporate antimicrobial additives.

**Low organic compound extraction:** Testing under BS 6920 (WRAS approval protocol) and
ACS methodology demonstrates that EPDM formulations for water contact applications have
very low extraction of organic compounds into water at temperatures up to 60°C. The
principal organic components of EPDM (carbon black filler, vulcanisation accelerators,
antioxidants) are either insoluble or present at concentrations below the detection limits
of standard water quality testing.

**Biofilm formation on EPDM:** All non-biocidal liner surfaces develop biofilm in rainwater
cisterns over time. In non-disinfected storage, a thin biofilm of aerobic bacteria and
associated microorganisms colonises the liner surface. This is a universal feature of any
water storage system not continuously disinfected, and is not caused by or accelerated by
the EPDM liner. Periodic cistern cleaning with dilute bleach solution is the standard
management approach, and EPDM is chemically compatible with hypochlorite disinfection at
any concentration used for cistern hygiene.

## EPDM vs Competing Materials for Rainwater Cisterns

**Reinforced concrete cisterns:**
Historically the dominant technology for large-volume rainwater storage in Portugal (the
traditional rectangular or round cistern, often buried under a quintal or terrace). Concrete
cisterns require:
- Continuous internal waterproofing (typically bituminous, epoxy or cementitious coatings
  that require maintenance and periodic renewal)
- Crack repair as concrete carbonates and the cement paste dries (cracking is essentially
  universal in old concrete cisterns)
- High construction cost for large volumes (shuttering, reinforcement, concrete delivery)
- No flexibility: once built, the volume and geometry are fixed

EPDM advantage: a membrane-lined earthwork or masonry cistern can be constructed to any
geometry using far less skilled labour and shorter construction time; EPDM provides the
waterproofing layer in a single flexible sheet that accommodates future ground movement;
no periodic recoating is required.

**HDPE/polypropylene prefabricated tanks:**
The current dominant technology for new residential rainwater harvesting installations in
Portugal. Prefabricated tanks from 500 to 10,000 litres are readily available. Limitations:
- Fixed geometry: the available sizes and shapes may not match available space
- Above-ground installation: HDPE tanks exposed to direct sun degrade from UV within
  10-15 years (chalking, embrittlement); installation in shade or underground is required
  for longevity
- Large volumes: HDPE tanks above 10,000 litres require large sections transported by
  specialist vehicles; site access constraints apply
- Below-ground structural risk: large HDPE tanks underground require careful backfill
  compaction to prevent deformation under soil load; uplift in high groundwater zones
  is a documented failure mode

EPDM advantage: custom-sized cisterns can be built in situ to match precisely available
space; the membrane liner is UV-stable without UV additives; above-ground EPDM cisterns
(with appropriate support structure) are UV-stable indefinitely; no transport size limits.

**GRP (glass-fibre reinforced polyester) tanks:**
Used for medium-to-large volume storage (5,000-50,000 litres) in agricultural and commercial
contexts. Limitations:
- Osmotic blistering in below-ground freshwater immersion: water penetrates through the
  gel coat and causes progressive delamination; particularly severe at joints
- Gel coat degradation: UV attack and chemical oxidation cause chalking and surface
  roughening in above-ground installations
- Weight and transport constraints: similar to HDPE for large volumes
- Repair difficulty: GRP repair requires specialist skills and materials

EPDM advantage: no osmotic risk; no gel coat; unlimited volume through in-situ construction.

## EPDM System Types for Rainwater Harvesting

**Underground cisterns (cisternas subterrâneas):**
The most effective configuration for cisterns in hot climates: underground storage maintains
water at ground temperature (12-18°C in central Portugal), suppressing biological activity,
reducing evaporation losses, and eliminating UV exposure. EPDM liners for underground cisterns
are installed over excavated earthwork or over masonry/concrete structural walls, providing
the waterproofing layer. Minimum recommended EPDM thickness for underground cisterns: 1.5 mm.

**Above-ground cisterns (cisternas à superfície):**
Constructed of masonry, concrete block, timber framing or steel frame, with EPDM providing
both waterproofing and UV resistance. Above-ground installations have the advantage of
gravitational water distribution without pumping, where the cistern is sited above the
distribution point. EPDM is the only flexible liner material that can be relied upon for
long-term above-ground installation without UV degradation. Minimum recommended thickness:
1.5 mm; exposed edges and terminations require aluminium capping to prevent mechanical damage.

**Integrated cisterns below paved areas:**
The most space-efficient configuration for urban and peri-urban properties in Portugal: a
concrete structure below a terrace, driveway or planted area is lined with EPDM, creating
cistern volume without occupying usable surface space. EPDM's dimensional stability and
high elongation accommodate the structural deflections inherent in loaded slabs.

**Pond and reservoir liners for agricultural use:**
Open reservoirs (açudes, albufeiras privadas) of any size — from 100 m² to several hectares
— can be lined with EPDM. Agricultural use cisterns and reservoirs for irrigation typically
store non-potable water and require no water quality certification. The primary performance
requirement is long-term watertightness and UV resistance at the waterline. EPDM at 1.0-1.5 mm
serves this application with projected life exceeding 40 years.

## Portuguese Regulatory Framework for Rainwater Harvesting

**Decreto-Lei 236/98 — Quality Standards for Water Use:**
This decree establishes water quality criteria for various uses including irrigation, industrial
use, and non-potable domestic uses. Annex XVI of DL 236/98 sets quality parameters for
reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation. Rainwater used for garden irrigation and vehicle
washing does not require specific treatment but should not contain pathogenic microorganisms
at dangerous concentrations.

**Decreto-Lei 119/2021 — Water Reuse (Reutilização de Água):**
This more recent decree establishes the framework for water reuse in Portugal, aligned with
EU Regulation 2020/741 on minimum requirements for water reuse. It establishes four quality
classes (A, B, C, D) for reclaimed water, with Class A being the most stringent (drip irrigation
of food crops). Harvested rainwater for toilet flushing and garden irrigation falls outside
the strict scope of this regulation, but its quality parameters provide a useful reference.

**Portaria 23/2021 — Technical Requirements for Water Reuse Systems:**
Establishes technical requirements for collection, storage, and distribution systems for
reclaimed water. Requires storage systems to be watertight, covered, and constructed of
materials that do not impair water quality. EPDM's water quality certifications (ACS/WRAS)
are the appropriate documentation for compliance with this portaria.

**Building Regulations (RCCTE / REH):**
Rainwater harvesting systems integrated into new buildings or major renovations may be
addressed in the Energy and Water Performance Certificate (Certificado de Desempenho
Energético e Qualidade do Ar Interior — SCE). The REH (Regulamento de Desempenho
Energético dos Edifícios de Habitação) encourages water efficiency measures including
rainwater harvesting for toilet flushing and irrigation.

**LNEC Specification E 452:**
The LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) has published guidance on rainwater
harvesting systems for domestic use, including storage tank sizing methodology, first-flush
diverter requirements, and overflow management. This is the most widely referenced
technical guidance for domestic rainwater harvesting design in Portugal.

**Municipal regulations:**
Some Portuguese municipalities (notably Cascais, Sintra, and several Algarve municipalities)
have adopted local regulations or incentive programmes for rainwater harvesting. The
Associação dos Municípios do Alentejo (AMLA) has promoted rainwater harvesting in the
context of the Alentejo's chronic water stress.

## Sizing Methodology for Portuguese Conditions

Cistern volume sizing for Portuguese rainwater harvesting follows two principal methods:

**Demand-based sizing:**
Estimate the target non-potable water demand over the dry season (typically 5-6 months in
Alentejo/Algarve, 3-4 months in central Portugal). Primary non-potable uses:
- Toilet flushing: 30-50 litres/person/day (Portuguese residential average)
- Garden irrigation: highly variable (20-200 m² of garden; 2-10 litres/m²/day depending
  on plant type and climate zone)
- Vehicle washing: 100-300 litres/event, 1-2 times per month
- Agricultural uses: irrigation of orchards, kitchen gardens (highly site-specific)

**Supply-based sizing:**
Calculate the maximum collectible volume in the rainy season (typically October-March in
southern Portugal) from available roof and hardscape collection surfaces, applying the
formula:

V = A × P × C × E

Where:
- V = collectible volume (litres)
- A = collection area (m²)
- P = annual rainfall (mm, equivalent to litres/m²)
- C = runoff coefficient (0.75-0.90 for tiles; 0.85-0.95 for flat concrete)
- E = system efficiency factor (0.85-0.95, accounting for first-flush diverter losses and
  evaporation from open cisterns)

A 200 m² roof in the Alentejo with 500 mm annual rainfall and tile covering:
V = 200 × 500 × 0.85 × 0.90 = 76,500 litres/year

For a family of four with toilet flushing and garden irrigation, demand of approximately
40,000-60,000 litres per year (non-potable) could be partially offset by this volume,
subject to seasonal matching of supply and demand.

The practical cistern sizing recommendation: the LNEC E 452 method suggests storage equal
to 15-25% of annual collectible volume as the economically optimal range. For the example
above, this gives 11,475-19,125 litres — typically a cistern of 10,000-20,000 litres capacity.

## System Integration Components

A complete rainwater harvesting system with EPDM liner includes:

**Collection and conveyance:**
- Roof gutters (caleiras) and downpipes (tubos de queda): standard zinc, PVC or copper
  guttering; compatible with EPDM
- First-flush diverter (separador de primeiras águas): diverts the first 1-2 mm of
  rainfall per collection event, which carries the highest concentration of dust, bird
  droppings, and particulate contamination from the roof surface
- Inlet pipe to cistern: should enter below the water surface to minimise turbulence
  and sediment disturbance; a calming inlet (diffuser) is recommended for large-volume
  cisterns

**Storage (EPDM-lined cistern):**
- EPDM liner: 1.5 mm minimum for all applications; 2.0 mm for cisterns subject to
  vehicle loading on the cover slab
- Inlet penetration: EPDM-specific penetration sleeve with compression ring; no mastic
  or silicone as primary seal
- Overflow: sized for 100-year rainfall event intensity; overflow discharges to
  soakaway, ditch or surface drainage; EPDM-lined overflow channel if integral to cistern
- Drain/access point: sealed penetration for periodic cleaning access

**Extraction and distribution:**
- Submersible pump: appropriate for cistern depth and distribution head
- Pressure vessel (vaso de expansão): maintains distribution pressure without continuous
  pump cycling
- Water level sensor and controller: triggers pump and signals low-water condition
- Non-potable water distribution pipe (should be marked to prevent cross-connection):
  NP EN 1717 requires physical separation of rainwater distribution from potable water

**Water treatment (for indoor non-potable use):**
- Cartridge filter: 50-100 micron pre-filter for sediment removal
- UV disinfection: recommended for toilet flushing water in Portugal if cistern is open
  or subject to contamination risk; ensures compliance with WHO guidelines for non-potable
  reuse in buildings
- Activated carbon filter: optional; addresses organic compounds and odour from biofilm
  in storage

## Environmental Credentials of EPDM for Water Harvesting

EPDM as a liner material for rainwater harvesting systems has a strong environmental profile:

**Longevity reduces embodied carbon burden:** A 1.5 mm EPDM liner for a 20,000-litre cistern
(approximately 50 m² of surface area, 75 kg of EPDM) has an embodied carbon footprint of
approximately 250-350 kg CO₂-equivalent (based on published EPDM LCA data, including raw
material extraction, polymerisation, and compounding). Spread over a 50-year service life,
this represents approximately 5-7 kg CO₂-equivalent per year — a negligible contribution
compared to the water conservation benefit.

**Water conservation impact:** Each 1,000 litres of harvested rainwater substituted for
mains potable water avoids approximately 0.3-0.5 kg CO₂-equivalent of water treatment
and distribution energy. A system harvesting 50,000 litres per year (feasible for a medium
agricultural property in the Alentejo) avoids 15-25 kg CO₂-equivalent per year in water
treatment energy — many times the annualised embodied carbon of the EPDM liner.

**Land use:** Underground cisterns lined with EPDM occupy no additional land area above
their structural footprint. Above-ground cisterns can be integrated into agricultural
structures (water tanks alongside farm buildings) with minimal additional footprint.

**End-of-life:** EPDM can be mechanically recycled at end of service life. Several European
recyclers process EPDM membranes into crumb rubber for use in play surfaces, acoustic
insulation, and asphalt modification. This contrasts with PVC liners (whose chlorine content
makes recycling difficult) and GRP tanks (which are effectively non-recyclable).
