# Potable Water — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Drinking Water Contact: Core Chemistry and Relevance

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is uniquely suited to potable water containment because
its chemical resistance to water-soluble contaminant migration is intrinsic to its molecular
architecture. The saturated carbon-carbon backbone of the EPDM polymer chain does not undergo
hydrolysis, oxidation or plasticiser migration under the conditions found in drinking water
storage systems — including the presence of residual disinfectants, pH adjustment chemicals and
seasonal temperature fluctuations.

Potable-water-grade EPDM is a distinct formulation category from standard roofing or pool EPDM.
The key formulation differences are:

- **Absence of plasticisers:** standard EPDM roofing membranes contain no plasticisers, but
  potable-grade EPDM is additionally tested for the complete absence of leachable organic compounds
  including processing oils and vulcanisation residues at levels that could affect water quality
- **Restricted vulcanisation system:** the sulphur donor agents, accelerators and activators used in
  vulcanisation are selected from lists of compounds approved under ACS and WRAS certification for
  potable water contact; zinc oxide (ZnO), the standard vulcanisation activator, is used at the
  lowest effective concentration and tested for leachable zinc
- **Carbon black grade and loading:** the carbon black used as UV absorber and reinforcing filler
  must meet food-contact grades; carbon black extractables testing is part of ACS certification
- **Antioxidant package:** antioxidants must be selected from compounds with established safety
  profiles under potable water contact conditions; hindered phenols (e.g. Irganox 1010) are
  standard in certified formulations

Key physical properties of potable-water-grade EPDM:
- Service temperature range: 0°C to 65°C (hot water sanitary storage); -45°C in cold conditions
- Elongation at break: 300-500% (typical certified formulations)
- Tensile strength: 9-12 N/mm² depending on grade
- Water absorption: < 1% by weight (ASTM D471; 7-day immersion at 70°C)
- Hardness: 55-70 Shore A
- pH resistance: stable from pH 5.5 to 9.5 (broader than standard pool water range)
- Organic compound migration: < 0.1 mg/L (EN 12873 migration test)

## WRAS Certification (United Kingdom)

The Water Regulations Advisory Scheme (WRAS) approval is the United Kingdom's standard for
materials, fittings and appliances in contact with water intended for human consumption. WRAS
approval requires testing under BS 6920: "Suitability of non-metallic products for use in
contact with water intended for human consumption with respect to their effect on the quality
of the water."

BS 6920 test protocol evaluates:
- **Odour test:** water in contact with the material must not develop odour above a threshold
  level compared to control water, at 23°C and 60°C contact temperatures
- **Taste test:** similarly evaluated for taste changes at both temperatures
- **Appearance of the extract:** turbidity, colour, and surface film formation
- **Growth of aquatic microorganisms:** bacteria count in the extract compared to control;
  the material must not promote microbial growth
- **Extraction of metals:** by atomic absorption spectrophotometry; specific limits for Pb, Cd,
  Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn and other regulated metals
- **Extraction of organic compounds:** total organic carbon (TOC) plus specific compound analysis

WRAS-approved EPDM membranes are widely used for large-volume water storage in the UK — in
water towers, service reservoirs, break pressure tanks and potable water mains expansion bellows.
WRAS approval is internationally recognised as a credible potable water contact standard and is
accepted by regulatory authorities in numerous non-UK jurisdictions.

## ACS Certification (France — Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire)

The ACS is the French ministerial certification for materials in contact with water intended for
human consumption, issued by accredited laboratories under the oversight of the French Ministère
de la Santé (Ministry of Health). ACS is arguably the most demanding certification in this space
because it requires testing for migration of specific compound classes rather than only general
extract parameters.

ACS testing for elastomeric materials (including EPDM) evaluates:
- Migration of sulphur-based vulcanisation residues (sulphur donors, accelerators, their
  transformation products)
- Migration of zinc (from ZnO activator)
- Migration of antioxidants and their metabolites
- Migration of carbon black extractables
- Odour imparted to water (organoleptic testing panel)
- TOC of water extracts at defined time-temperature-volume conditions

The governing French regulation is the Arrêté du 29 mai 1997 relatif aux matériaux et objets
utilisés dans les installations fixes de production, de traitement et de distribution des eaux
destinées à la consommation humaine, as amended. This arrêté establishes the list of approved
starting substances for elastomers in potable water contact and the migration limits.

ACS is recognised by regulatory authorities throughout the EU, including ERSAR (Entidade
Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos) in Portugal, as demonstrating compliance with
Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption.

## NSF/ANSI 61 (United States and International Markets)

NSF International Standard 61 — "Drinking Water System Components — Health Effects" — is the
principal certification for potable water system materials in the United States and is recognised
in numerous international markets. NSF 61 certification requires:

- Extraction testing under EPA-protocol analytical conditions
- Evaluation against Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) targets set by the US Environmental
  Protection Agency for regulated drinking water contaminants
- Annual plant audits and periodic re-testing

EPDM membranes and gaskets certified to NSF 61 are widely used in North American potable water
distribution infrastructure. For the European (including Portuguese) market, NSF 61 is typically
secondary to ACS and WRAS but is relevant for internationally specified projects and for equipment
exported from Europe to North American markets.

## KTW Guideline (Germany — Kunststoffe und Trinkwasser)

The KTW guideline, administered by the German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt), sets
requirements for plastic materials in contact with drinking water. The KTW positive list defines
which substances may be incorporated into plastic products that contact drinking water. For
elastomers, a separate assessment protocol applies.

KTW-listed EPDM formulations are used extensively in German water infrastructure — pipe gaskets,
flexible couplings, tank liners, and membrane expansion joints in potable water mains. KTW
compliance is substantially equivalent to ACS compliance and many certified formulations hold
both approvals concurrently.

## ACS vs Potable Water Contact: What ACS Does NOT Certify

It is important to note that ACS certification applies to the specific EPDM formulation as
manufactured, not to an installed system. On-site installation practices, adhesives, seam tapes,
and penetration accessories must also be certified for potable water contact. An installed
system claiming potable water compliance must use:

- ACS/WRAS-certified EPDM membrane
- ACS/WRAS-certified adhesives (where used)
- ACS/WRAS-certified seam tapes or weld materials
- ACS/WRAS-certified penetration flanges and accessories

This is a critical point for compliance documentation in municipal reservoir applications, where
the entire installed system — not just the membrane — may be required to meet regulatory standards.

## Application Types for EPDM in Potable Water Infrastructure

**Municipal drinking water reservoirs (reservatórios municipais de distribuição)**
Reinforced concrete service reservoirs — typically holding 500 m³ to 50,000 m³ of treated
drinking water — are the primary infrastructure application for EPDM potable water liners.
Many of Portugal's municipal reservoirs were built in the 1960s-1990s and have concrete
without an interior lining, or with deteriorated paint coatings. EPDM liner rehabilitation
is established practice for these assets.

**Elevated water towers (torres de água)**
Steel or concrete water towers providing pressure-equalising storage in distribution networks.
EPDM liners are used inside the tank structure. The flexibility of EPDM (400%+ elongation)
accommodates the thermal expansion and contraction of steel tower tanks.

**Domestic cisterns (cisternas domésticas)**
In rural Portugal, properties with private boreholes (furos), springs (nascentes) or roof
rainwater collection for potable use require certified cisterns. EPDM-lined concrete cisterns
offer substantially greater capacity and durability than polyethylene cisterns while meeting
the same potable water certification requirements.

**Break pressure tanks and balancing tanks (tanques de compensação)**
Intermediate storage tanks in water distribution networks where pressure must be managed.
Typically reinforced concrete, lined with EPDM for potable water compliance.

**Hospital and healthcare facility water storage**
Healthcare facilities have heightened requirements for Legionella control and water quality,
making certified EPDM with its smooth, non-porous surface particularly well suited.

**Food processing and beverage facilities**
While regulated under food-contact legislation rather than drinking water legislation, the
same EPDM formulations certified for potable water are applicable to food process water
storage where the water comes into contact with the stored membrane material.

## EPDM vs Alternative Potable Water Lining Systems

**Epoxy coatings for potable water (tintas epóxi para água potável)**
Two-component epoxy coatings certified for potable water contact (e.g., Jotun Jotacoat,
Sigma Coatings Sigmacover) are the conventional lining material for rehabilitation of
concrete service reservoirs. Their limitations:
- Rigid film (0-3% elongation): any substrate crack propagates directly through the coating
- Service life: 10-15 years before recoating is required due to oxidation and chalking
- Application sensitivity: surface moisture content > 4% causes adhesion failure; complex
  surface preparation including acid etching, blast cleaning and primer application
- Recoating requires reservoir decommissioning and full decontamination each time
- Not suitable for bridging structural cracks wider than 0.3 mm

EPDM advantage: 50+ year service life (no recoating), bridges cracks up to several mm,
applicable over residual moisture (with correct system), single installation for reservoir life.

**Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) cisterns**
Pre-formed PE cisterns certified to EN 12451 are widely used for domestic potable water storage
in Portugal. Their limitations:
- Maximum practical volume: approximately 10 m³ (constrained by transport and installation)
- Long-term UV and oxidative degradation: PE degrades with UV exposure if not fully buried;
  black HDPE has better UV resistance but still degrades at 25-40 years
- Temperature limitation: standard PE cisterns are not suitable for water above 40-50°C
- Seismic vulnerability: pre-formed rigid cisterns require careful foundation design; concrete
  with EPDM liner is inherently more seismically robust

EPDM advantage: unlimited volume (limited only by structure), 50+ year service life, suitable
for 0-65°C including domestic hot water storage, conforms to irregular site geometries.

**Stainless steel tanks**
316L stainless steel is used for hygienic water storage in food and pharmaceutical industries.
- Cost: 10-15x higher than EPDM-lined concrete for equivalent volume
- Corrosion: stainless steel is susceptible to crevice corrosion and chloride stress corrosion
  cracking in high-chloride environments; coastal Portugal is a relevant concern
- Limited by size: practical limit for single-piece stainless tanks is approximately 200 m³

EPDM advantage: significantly lower cost, no corrosion concerns, unlimited volume.

**Glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GRP) tanks**
GRP tanks with gel coat certified for potable water contact are used for industrial water storage.
- Osmotic blistering: a known failure mode for GRP in permanent water contact
- UV degradation of gel coat if exposed
- Limited by transport size for pre-formed tanks; in-situ lamination quality dependent on
  skilled applicators

## Portuguese Regulatory Framework for Potable Water Quality

**Decreto-Lei 152/2017** (transposing EU Directive 2015/1787 amending Annex II and III of
Council Directive 98/83/EC): establishes the current legal framework for water quality
parameters for water intended for human consumption in Portugal. Defines parametric values
for 50+ regulated compounds including metals, organic compounds, microbiological parameters
and indicator organisms. All potable water storage materials must not cause these parameters
to be exceeded.

**ERSAR (Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos):** the Portuguese regulatory
body for water and waste services. ERSAR oversees compliance of water service providers
(municipally-run water utilities and private concessionaires) with quality and safety standards.
ERSAR guidance documents reference European certification standards (ACS, WRAS, KTW) as the
means of demonstrating material compliance for potable water contact.

**Portaria 702/2020:** defines the Sistema de Gestão de Segurança Alimentar da Água (Water
Food Safety Management System) requirements for large public water supply systems, including
materials management requirements that reference CE marking and European certification standards.

**NP EN 805:** "Water supply — Requirements for systems and components outside buildings."
Specifies requirements for materials, products and components in contact with water intended
for human consumption, including elastomeric sealing materials.

**EU Regulation 2020/2184** (Drinking Water Directive recast): the most recent revision of
EU drinking water legislation, introducing stricter limits for several chemical parameters and
requiring Member States to establish positive lists of approved substances for materials in
contact with drinking water. Portugal must transpose this directive and establish national
testing protocols aligned with the harmonised European testing protocols under development
by CEN/TC 164.

## Migration Testing: What the Standards Actually Test

Migration testing is the quantitative foundation of potable water material certification. The
purpose is to establish that the material does not transfer harmful compounds to the water
stored in contact with it, at a level that would exceed the parametric values of the Drinking
Water Directive.

**EN 12873 (Migration Testing Protocol)**
EN 12873 defines the migration test conditions for materials in contact with potable water:
- Test water: standardised water of defined composition (pH 8.0, hardness, dissolved oxygen)
- Contact conditions: three successive 24-hour extractions at 23°C, followed by one 24-hour
  extraction at 60°C (the "worst case" thermally activated migration scenario)
- Volume-to-surface-area ratio: defined by the standard to represent worst-case contact scenarios
- Analysis: TOC of combined extracts; specific compound analysis for regulated substances

The migration test represents a conservative worst-case assessment of material behaviour in
service. EPDM certified under ACS and WRAS has been shown to produce water extract TOC
concentrations below the threshold values in EN 12873 and the corresponding national regulations.

## Legionella Control and EPDM Surface Properties

Legionella pneumophila, the causative organism of Legionnaires' disease, proliferates in
water systems with temperatures between 20°C and 45°C, particularly in water systems where
biofilm provides nutrients and physical protection. Material surface properties are a recognised
factor in Legionella risk management.

EPDM's smooth, non-porous surface provides inherently less surface area for biofilm attachment
than rough concrete or corroded metal surfaces. This is a recognised advantage in hot water
storage applications (temperatures often cycling through the 20-45°C risk zone) and in
healthcare facility water systems where Legionella risk management is regulated.

UK Health Technical Memorandum HTM 04-01 (Safe Water in Healthcare Premises) references
material surface smoothness as a factor in Legionella control and implies preference for
smooth-surface materials in water storage applications. The EPDM surface finish is equivalent
in smoothness to new stainless steel.

## Key Studies and Industry Data

**Water Research Foundation (WaterRF, formerly AWWARF) studies on elastomers in potable water:**
Multiple studies have evaluated EPDM gasket and lining materials in potable water systems,
consistently finding EPDM to be chemically compatible at the concentrations of residual
disinfectant (chlorine 0.5-2.0 mg/L) found in distribution systems. No adverse water quality
effects have been documented from EPDM in certified formulations.

**SKZ (Süddeutsches Kunststoff-Zentrum) long-term studies:**
SKZ has conducted accelerated aging studies on EPDM waterproofing materials, including
immersion in water at elevated temperatures to project service life via Arrhenius kinetics.
Projected service life of 50+ years at typical service temperatures (15-25°C continuous
immersion) is consistently supported by these studies for materials with no detectable
mechanical or chemical degradation in the test period.

**Portuguese water infrastructure context:**
Portugal's SMAS (Serviços Municipalizados de Águas e Saneamento) and municipal water utilities
manage approximately 2,100 service reservoirs nationally, with an estimated 40% requiring
rehabilitation or re-lining within the next 15 years (based on age and inspection data
reported in ERSAR annual reports). EPDM liner rehabilitation is an established technology
in this sector, competing with epoxy coating as the principal rehabilitation approach.
