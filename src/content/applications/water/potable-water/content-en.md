# EPDM Certified Membrane for Potable Water Storage — The Membriko Guide

## Safe Drinking Water Infrastructure — The Material That Cannot Be Overlooked

Of all the engineering decisions made in water infrastructure, the choice of lining material
for a potable water reservoir is among the least visible and most consequential. The reservoir
sits out of sight — underground, elevated on a hillside, or buried beneath a car park — and
stores treated water that will flow, unaltered, to every tap connected to the network. If the
lining material introduces contaminants, those contaminants reach the consumer.

This is not a theoretical concern. Uncertified concrete leeches calcium hydroxide into stored
water, raising pH and imparting bitterness. Uncertified epoxy coatings degrade and release
organic compounds. Standard PVC cisterns — widely used in rural domestic water supply —
contain phthalate plasticisers that migrate into stored water at rates that increase with
temperature. None of these failures are visible to the reservoir operator. Most go undetected
until a routine chemical analysis reveals anomalies that regulators are only now beginning to
investigate systematically.

Membriko, based in Pombal in central Portugal, supplies and installs EPDM membrane certified
to ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire, France) and WRAS (Water Regulations Advisory
Scheme, United Kingdom) for all applications involving water intended for human consumption.
This is not a marketing differentiation — it is the only technically defensible position when
the material is in direct and permanent contact with drinking water.

This guide explains why, with the technical precision Membriko applies to every project: no
ambiguity, no vague claims, and full reference to the test protocols and regulatory frameworks
that govern drinking water quality in Portugal and the European Union.

## Why EPDM for Potable Water — The Case for Certified Food-Safe Specification

### The Contamination Risk of Non-Certified Materials

Every material in contact with water intended for human consumption is a potential contamination
source. This is precisely why the European Drinking Water Directive (EU Regulation 2020/2184,
transposed in Portugal through Decreto-Lei 152/2017) requires materials to be assessed for their
effect on water quality. The principal contamination pathways that Membriko's EPDM specification
eliminates are:

**Unlined concrete:** Portland cement hydration produces calcium hydroxide as a by-product.
In contact with water, concrete progressively dissolves Ca(OH)₂ into the stored water, raising
pH and imparting an alkaline taste. Concrete surfaces are also inherently rough and porous —
the ideal substrate for biofilm formation, including Legionella pneumophila colonies in hot water
reservoirs cycling through the 20-45°C risk temperature band.

**Non-certified epoxy coatings:** certified potable water epoxy coatings exist and are legitimate
(Jotun Jotacoat 62, Sigma Coatings certified products), but many reservoir rehabilitation
projects use general-purpose epoxy coatings that have not been subjected to migration testing
for drinking water contact. As the coating ages (10-15 year practical service life), the epoxy
film degrades and releases decomposition products into the stored water. Every subsequent
recoating requires the reservoir to be taken out of service — a recurring disruption.

**Standard PVC and uncertified plastics:** standard PVC contains 20-40% by weight of plasticiser —
typically phthalates, recognised endocrine disruptors that are regulated compounds under EU
Regulation 2020/2184. These plasticisers are not chemically bound to the PVC matrix; they are
blended in and migrate progressively into stored water, at rates that increase markedly with
water temperature. ACS and WRAS certification for potable water contact prohibits phthalate use
in certified formulations.

### The Chemical Inertness of Certified EPDM

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic rubber whose primary polymer chain
consists exclusively of carbon-carbon single bonds — a saturated backbone that is chemically
inert to all compounds present in treated drinking water. The chain does not undergo hydrolysis
in contact with water. It is not attacked by the residual disinfectant chlorine typically
present in distribution systems at 0.1-0.5 mg/L. It contains no plasticisers to migrate.

Membriko specifies EPDM formulated specifically for potable water contact, with the following
characteristics that distinguish this grade from standard roofing EPDM:

- **No plasticisers:** EPDM's flexibility derives from its vulcanised elastomer architecture,
  not from plasticiser additives susceptible to migration
- **Restricted vulcanisation system:** the accelerators and activators used in vulcanisation
  are selected from lists of compounds approved under ACS and WRAS protocols; zinc oxide (ZnO),
  the standard vulcanisation activator, is used at minimum effective concentration and leachable
  zinc is tested and documented
- **Food-contact grade carbon black:** the carbon black used as UV absorber and reinforcing
  filler is of the grade tested for extractables under ACS methodology
- **Certified antioxidant package:** antioxidants are selected from compounds with established
  safety profiles for potable water contact under BS 6920 and ACS protocols

### EN 12873 Migration Testing — What It Actually Demonstrates

Migration testing under EN 12873 is the quantitative foundation of potable water material
certification. The test protocol is deliberately conservative — representing a worst-case
assessment of material behaviour in service:

- Standardised test water of defined composition (pH 8.0, controlled hardness, dissolved oxygen)
- Three successive 24-hour extractions at 23°C, followed by one extraction at 60°C (thermally
  activated worst-case migration scenario)
- Water volume-to-contact-surface-area ratio representing the worst-case contact geometry
- Analysis: total organic carbon (TOC) of combined extracts; specific compound analysis for
  regulated substances

Certified EPDM tested under EN 12873 produces water extracts with TOC below 0.1 mg/L — more
than 50 times below the European Drinking Water Directive indicative parameter for TOC of
5 mg/L (the 5 mg/L figure is a water treatment system indicator, not a direct material migration
limit; the comparison illustrates the wide margin of safety). The < 0.1 mg/L migration value
of certified EPDM means the material does not measurably contribute to the organic compound
load of stored drinking water, even under the most adverse test conditions.

## Certification Standards — WRAS, NSF/ANSI 61, ACS, KTW

Membriko specifies EPDM with dual ACS and WRAS certification because these are the reference
standards recognised by European regulatory bodies, including ERSAR in Portugal. Understanding
what each certification evaluates is essential to appreciating why dual certification represents
best practice rather than redundancy.

### ACS — Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire (France)

ACS is the French ministerial certification for materials in contact with water intended for
human consumption. It is arguably the most chemically specific certification in this space: rather
than evaluating only aggregate extract parameters, ACS tests for the migration of particular
compound classes.

For elastomers including EPDM, ACS evaluates:
- Migration of sulphur-based vulcanisation residues (sulphur donors, accelerators, their
  transformation products)
- Migration of zinc (from ZnO activator)
- Migration of antioxidants and their metabolites
- Carbon black extractables
- Odour imparted to water (trained organoleptic panel)
- TOC of water extracts at defined time-temperature-volume conditions

The governing regulation is the Arrêté du 29 mai 1997 relatif aux matériaux et objets utilisés
dans les installations fixes de production, de traitement et de distribution des eaux destinées à
la consommation humaine. ERSAR recognises ACS certification as demonstrating compliance with
Decreto-Lei 152/2017 for materials in contact with potable water.

### WRAS — Water Regulations Advisory Scheme (United Kingdom)

WRAS is issued by WRAS Ltd (an independent certification body) under BS 6920. In addition to
the parameters assessed by ACS, WRAS includes:

- **Microbial growth promotion assessment:** the water extract is analysed for bacterial growth
  compared to reference water; the material must not promote microbial growth — a critical
  parameter for Legionella risk management in hot water storage
- Odour and taste evaluation at 23°C and 60°C
- Metal extraction by atomic absorption spectrophotometry
- Organic compound extraction analysis

WRAS is internationally recognised and is accepted by regulatory authorities in numerous
countries outside the UK. Membriko specifies WRAS-certified EPDM because the microbial growth
assessment provides an additional layer of assurance not available in the ACS protocol alone.

### NSF/ANSI 61 (United States and International Markets)

NSF/ANSI 61 — "Drinking Water System Components — Health Effects" — is the primary certification
for potable water materials in the United States. For internationally specified projects, or
for equipment exported to North American markets, NSF 61 certification complements the ACS/WRAS
approvals. Membriko can specify EPDM with NSF 61 certification where required by the project
specification or client procurement standards.

### KTW — Kunststoffe und Trinkwasser (Germany)

The KTW guideline, administered by the German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt),
establishes the approved substance list for plastic materials in contact with drinking water.
It is substantially equivalent to ACS and is required for materials entering German water
distribution networks. Many EPDM formulations hold ACS and KTW concurrently. For European
projects with German involvement or specification references, Membriko can confirm KTW status
for specified products.

### Whole-System Certification — Not Just the Membrane

A critical point Membriko communicates to all clients: ACS/WRAS certification applies to the
specific EPDM formulation as manufactured, not to the installed system as a whole. A system
claiming potable water compliance must use certified materials throughout the assembly in contact
with water:

- ACS/WRAS certified EPDM membrane
- ACS/WRAS certified adhesives (where used)
- ACS/WRAS certified seam tapes and weld materials
- ACS/WRAS certified penetration flanges and fittings

Membriko maintains a certified supply chain for all materials used in potable water contact,
and provides certificates for every component in the technical dossier issued at project completion.
This is not paperwork — it is the evidence base for regulatory compliance.

## Application Types — Municipal Reservoirs, Private Tanks, Water Towers

Portugal has a diverse portfolio of potable water storage infrastructure, and Membriko serves
the full spectrum — from large municipal service reservoirs to small domestic cisterns on rural
holdings.

### Municipal Service Reservoirs

Municipal service reservoirs in Portugal are typically reinforced concrete structures built
between the 1960s and 1990s, with capacities ranging from 50 m³ (small villages) to 50,000 m³
(head reservoirs for urban distribution systems). ERSAR's annual infrastructure reports document
approximately 2,100 service reservoirs in mainland Portugal, with an estimated 40% requiring
rehabilitation within the next 15 years.

The most common condition Membriko encounters in these assets is concrete without a certified
interior lining, or with deteriorated epoxy coating at end of its service life. Rehabilitation
with ACS-certified EPDM is the reference process:

- Concrete surface prepared by high-pressure hydroblasting or light blast cleaning
- Cracks injected with potable-water-safe epoxy resin
- ACS/WRAS EPDM 1.5-2.0 mm installed as interior liner using certified adhesive
- All penetrations (raw water inlet, distribution outlet, overflow, level probes, access covers)
  fitted with ACS/WRAS certified EPDM flanges and compression fittings
- Post-installation disinfection per NP EN 805; water quality analysis by accredited laboratory
  before return to service

The technical dossier Membriko issues for each municipal reservoir project contains all
documentation required for the water service operator's ERSAR compliance records: ACS and WRAS
certificates for membrane and accessories, installation record with photographic evidence, post-
disinfection water quality analysis, and a 20-year installation warranty certificate.

### Domestic Potable Water Cisterns

In rural Portugal — across Trás-os-Montes, the Beiras, the Alentejo, and parts of the
Algarve interior — thousands of properties rely on private boreholes, springs or surface
catchments for their drinking water supply. These properties require certified storage.

The standard polyethylene cistern (PE, certified to EN 12451) is adequate for volumes up to
approximately 10 m³ and service lives of 25-30 years. Beyond these parameters, the alternative
is a reinforced concrete cistern lined with ACS-certified EPDM. The advantages are clear:
unlimited volume constrained only by the structure, 50+ year service life without replacement,
and documented water quality certification for submission to the Regional Health Authority
(Autoridade Regional de Saúde, ARS) when registering a private water supply point.

Membriko installs ACS EPDM in both new concrete cisterns and rehabilitated existing stone or
concrete cisterns on rural properties throughout central Portugal and Pombal's surrounding region.

### Elevated Water Towers

Steel and concrete water towers provide pressure head for municipal distribution systems. Membriko
installs ACS-certified EPDM inside both steel and concrete tower structures. For steel towers,
EPDM's 300-400% elongation is particularly relevant: steel expands and contracts with seasonal
temperature variation, and rigid coatings such as epoxy fail under these thermally induced
movements. EPDM accommodates structural movement without compromising either watertightness or
potable water certification compliance.

### Institutional Water Storage — Hospitals, Hotels and Commercial Buildings

Hospitals, large hotels, schools, commercial buildings and industrial facilities with reinforced
concrete or steel potable water storage tanks represent a growing segment for Membriko. Two
factors are primary drivers in this market:

**Legionella control:** Decreto-Lei 52/2018 (Legionella prevention in water systems of buildings
open to the public) requires risk management plans that include the assessment of water storage
material surface properties. EPDM's smooth, non-porous surface inhibits biofilm attachment —
the mechanism by which Legionella colonies establish in rough concrete and corroded metal surfaces.
Membriko provides technical documentation on EPDM surface properties for inclusion in clients'
DL 52/2018 risk management plans.

**Audit traceability:** hospitals, hotels and institutional buildings face regular regulatory and
insurance audits of their water systems. Membriko's full technical dossier — ACS/WRAS certificates
for membrane and accessories, installation records, laboratory water quality report, and 20-year
warranty — provides the audit trail these clients require.

## EPDM vs Epoxy, Stainless Steel and Concrete for Potable Water

Membriko presents this comparison with technical honesty. Each material has contexts where it
is the correct choice. The relevant question for potable water storage is which material combines
the necessary regulatory certification with the performance characteristics the application demands.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Certified Epoxy Coating | Stainless Steel 316L | PE Cistern | Unlined Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Potable water certification | ACS + WRAS (dual) | Some products — verify | Yes (316L) | EN 12451 / ACS | Not adequate |
| Service life | 50+ years | 10-15 years | 30-50 years | 25-30 years | N/A |
| Structural crack bridging | Excellent — 300%+ elongation | None — rigid | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Periodic recoating required | No | Every 10-15 years | No | No (replacement) | N/A |
| Maximum practical volume | Unlimited | Unlimited | ~200 m³ | ~10 m³ | Unlimited |
| Legionella surface risk | Smooth — low | Degrades to rough | Smooth — low | Smooth | Rough — high |
| 50-year cost index | 100 | 280 (3-4 recoatings) | 350 | 180 (2 replacements) | N/A |
| ERSAR compliance dossier | Full — all materials | Partial | Full | Partial | Not applicable |

Honest acknowledgement: stainless steel 316L tanks are the industry standard for small-volume
pharmaceutical and high-end food-contact applications where contamination tolerance is zero and
cost is secondary. PE cisterns are a practical and economical solution for domestic supply
volumes under 5-10 m³ with expected asset lives under 30 years. Membriko's position is clear:
for any application combining large volume, 50-year service life, ERSAR compliance documentation
requirements, and the need to bridge concrete substrate movement — EPDM ACS certification is the
only specification with a consistent technical foundation.

## Installation Process — Hygiene Protocols for Potable Water

Membriko's installation methodology for potable water reservoirs is explicitly distinct from
its general waterproofing practice. In potable water applications, every material introduced
into the reservoir interior must be certified, every procedure must be documented, and the
installation output must be a system — not just a membrane — that satisfies regulatory requirements.

### Step 1: Sanitary Engineering Coordination

Every potable water reservoir project begins with coordination with a registered sanitary
engineer. This is not optional — it is Membriko's professional standard. The sanitary engineer's
role is to verify that the rehabilitation project complies with Decreto-Lei 152/2017, ERSAR
guidance and NP EN 805. Membriko provides the engineer with full technical documentation on
the membrane and all accessories — ACS/WRAS certificates, CE declarations of performance,
safety data sheets — for review and incorporation into the project documentation.

### Step 2: Structure Preparation with Certified Materials

Concrete preparation is the most critical phase for long-term lining performance. Membriko
uses exclusively certified materials for all work inside the reservoir:

- High-pressure hydroblasting (200-300 bar) to clean the concrete surface, remove biofilm,
  scale and residues from previous coatings
- Crack repair with potable-water-safe epoxy injection resin — no solvent-based resins without
  potable water certification
- Grinding of sharp edges and protrusions — acute edges create stress concentration points
  on the membrane under hydrostatic pressure
- Surface planarity verification: irregularities greater than 5 mm in a 2-metre straight edge
  are corrected with certified levelling mortar

All operatives working inside the reservoir wear clean protective clothing and do not introduce
non-certified materials into the reservoir interior.

### Step 3: Pre-Installation Inspection

Before any membrane is installed, Membriko carries out a formal surface inspection with
systematic photographic documentation. A technical supervisor signs acceptance of the prepared
surface — if the surface is not in suitable condition, installation does not proceed. This
inspection is recorded and included in the final project technical dossier.

### Step 4: Installation of Certified EPDM Membrane

Installation begins at the reservoir floor. The ACS/WRAS certified EPDM membrane is positioned
and adhered using certified contact adhesive — a product holding the same ACS/WRAS certification
as the membrane, without exception.

Full-surface adhesion is used throughout (fully adhered method), ensuring no air pockets exist
between the membrane and the concrete substrate that could create differential pressure during
water level variations. Walls are lined subsequently, with 100 mm overlap onto the floor panel
and seaming with certified 150 mm QuickSeam tape.

For large reservoirs (over 500 m³), Membriko designs the membrane cut layout to minimise seam
length, exploiting the availability of EPDM panels in widths up to 15.25 metres.

### Step 5: Certified Penetration Fittings

Every penetration in the reservoir — raw water inlet, distribution outlet, overflow, level probes,
temperature sensors, access covers — is sealed with an ACS/WRAS certified EPDM compression
flange that creates a mechanical and chemical seal between the membrane and the penetrating element.

Membriko does not use mastics, silicones or other non-certified sealants in water-contact zones.
The certification chain is continuous from membrane to the last flange fastening bolt.

### Step 6: Disinfection and Water Quality Analysis

Following installation, the reservoir is disinfected per NP EN 805 protocol: filled with water
containing sodium hypochlorite at 20-50 mg/L free chlorine, held for a minimum of 24 hours,
drained and refilled with treated potable water.

A water sample is collected by an accredited laboratory (ISO 17025 accreditation) after the
final fill. Analysis covers microbiological parameters (Escherichia coli, enterococci, coliforms,
colony counts at 22°C and 37°C) and relevant chemical parameters (including TOC, metals and
residual chlorine). The reservoir enters service only after laboratory approval. The sodium
hypochlorite concentration used for disinfection (20-50 mg/L) is fully within certified EPDM's
chemical resistance range — far above the 0.1-0.5 mg/L residual chlorine in distribution.

### Step 7: Technical Dossier and Warranty

At project completion, Membriko issues the complete technical dossier:

- ACS and WRAS certificates for the EPDM membrane (with traceable batch number)
- ACS/WRAS certificates for adhesive, seam tapes and penetration flanges
- CE Declaration of Performance (EN 13956) for the membrane
- Photographic installation record (pre-installation, during installation, post-installation)
- Seam probe test record (every linear metre of seam)
- Disinfection protocol per NP EN 805
- Laboratory water quality analysis report
- 20-year Membriko installation warranty certificate
- Documentation to support the water service operator's ERSAR compliance registration

## Water Quality and EPDM — Taste, Odour, and Migration Testing

The immediate quality indicators for drinking water consumers are taste and odour. Before any
chemical analysis is conducted, the person filling their glass from the tap forms an instant
assessment of water quality from its smell and taste. Any material introducing perceptible
changes fails its primary obligation to the end user.

### Does EPDM Affect the Taste of Drinking Water?

No. Certified ACS and WRAS EPDM formulations are tested by trained organoleptic panels under
conditions representing worst-case contact between material and water. The BS 6920 (WRAS)
protocol requires that water in contact with the material at both 23°C and 60°C is indistinguishable
from reference water within defined taste perception threshold parameters.

Membriko makes this documentation available — not as a general claim but as specific test reports
for the formulations it specifies. These reports can be provided to clients and regulatory
authorities as part of the compliance dossier.

### Does EPDM Affect the Odour of Drinking Water?

No, for the same reasons. Both ACS organoleptic testing and BS 6920 odour threshold evaluation
confirm that certified EPDM does not impart odour to water across the full range of application
temperatures. This is a meaningful distinction from other rubber materials that are not EPDM:
natural rubber, nitrile rubber (NBR), neoprene (polychloroprene) and SBR all have different
chemical compositions and different odour migration profiles. Membriko specifies only certified
EPDM — never natural rubber or other rubber formulations — for potable water applications.

### What Does < 0.1 mg/L TOC Migration Mean in Practice?

Migration testing quantifies the mass of organic compound transferred from the material to water
per unit volume under defined contact conditions. The < 0.1 mg/L TOC value for certified EPDM
under EN 12873 means the material is adding less than 0.1 milligrams of organic carbon per litre
of water in contact with it — under accelerated, worst-case laboratory conditions. In a real
reservoir where water residence time is typically 24-72 hours and contact geometry is more
favourable than the test, the actual migration will be substantially lower.

To contextualise: the World Health Organisation guideline value for benzo(a)pyrene (the regulated
polyaromatic hydrocarbon in drinking water) is 0.00001 mg/L. The TOC value of 0.1 mg/L for
certified EPDM is an aggregate of all organic carbon in the extract — including compounds that
are not themselves harmful at these concentrations but are measured as a system indicator.
The specific compound analysis within the ACS protocol confirms no regulated contaminants
at levels approaching parametric values.

## Rehabilitation of Existing Reservoirs

Reservoir rehabilitation is the primary context for Membriko's potable water work. Portugal's
drinking water storage infrastructure includes many structures with 30-60 years of service
life, built of concrete without certified interior linings or with degraded coatings that no
longer meet regulatory standards. The question is not whether to rehabilitate — ERSAR's
infrastructure quality metrics make this imperative — but how to rehabilitate for a 50-year
horizon.

### What Membriko Can Rehabilitate with EPDM

**Unlined concrete reservoirs:** the most common target. Concrete surface is prepared, cracks
are injected, and ACS/WRAS EPDM is installed as interior liner. The asset's service life
is extended by 50+ years and its regulatory compliance status is transformed from uncertain
to documented.

**Reservoirs with failed epoxy coatings:** if existing epoxy is in sound condition (good
adhesion, no widespread delamination), Membriko can install EPDM over the existing coating
after surface preparation. If the epoxy is delaminating, it is removed by hydroblasting before
EPDM installation.

**Old stone and brick-lined cisterns:** common in rural Portuguese properties, these can be
rehabilitated with ACS EPDM provided the structure is sound. Membriko assesses structural
condition at the technical visit and advises clearly on any pre-work required.

**Steel water towers with corrosion:** interior EPDM lining rehabilitates corroded steel
tower structures. The flexibility of EPDM accommodates the thermal movements of steel that
cause premature failure in rigid coatings.

### Speed Advantage Over Epoxy in Reservoir Rehabilitation

Epoxy coating rehabilitation requires multiple coats with curing intervals between each, resulting
in 15-25 days with the reservoir out of service for a complete application. EPDM installation
in a 500 m³ service reservoir is typically completed in 5-7 working days, followed by disinfection
and water quality analysis (2-3 additional days). Total out-of-service time: 7-10 days for
a 500 m³ reservoir, compared to 18-28 days for an epoxy system. For water utilities managing
distribution pressure zones, this difference in outage duration has direct operational value.

### What Requires Additional Engineering Before EPDM

- Structurally cracked concrete with active water ingress: cracks must be grouted with hydro-
  expansive polyurethane before liner installation
- Contaminated reservoirs with residual biological or chemical contamination: specialist
  decontamination before rehabilitation works
- Reservoirs with active external groundwater pressure: drainage strategy to manage hydrostatic
  back-pressure against the liner

Membriko identifies these conditions at the technical site visit and advises the client with
complete clarity — no surprises in the execution phase.

## Maintenance and Disinfection

One of the practical advantages of EPDM in potable water reservoirs is the near absence of
membrane-specific maintenance requirements across the full 50+ year service life. Unlike epoxy
coating — which requires reapplication every 10-15 years, each reapplication requiring the
reservoir to be taken out of service — EPDM has no intrinsic maintenance requirements beyond
the routine procedures obligatory for any potable water reservoir.

### Annual Visual Inspection

Portuguese legislation (Decreto-Lei 152/2017 and ERSAR guidance) requires visual inspection
of all potable water reservoirs at minimum annual intervals. EPDM facilitates this inspection:
the smooth, uniform surface (typically black or dark grey) immediately reveals any anomaly —
blistering, delamination, mechanical damage — against the clean background. Embriko provides
each client with a specific inspection checklist for EPDM-lined reservoirs, indicating the
inspection points (seams, penetrations, the membrane-to-structure transition line) and acceptance
criteria.

### Cleaning and Disinfection

Certified EPDM is compatible with all standard disinfection procedures for potable water
reservoirs in Portugal:

- **Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl):** the most commonly used reservoir disinfectant in Portugal,
  at concentrations of 20-50 mg/L for annual or post-installation disinfection — fully within
  EPDM's chemical resistance range
- **Chlorine dioxide (ClO₂):** used in some municipal distribution systems — compatible with
  certified EPDM
- **High-pressure water cleaning:** EPDM can be cleaned with hydroblasting up to 300 bar
  without damage — the most effective method for removing scale or biofilm from the membrane surface

Acid or solvent-based cleaners should not be used inside EPDM-lined reservoirs without prior
consultation with Membriko. Although EPDM is chemically resistant to a broad range of compounds,
strong acids (HCl, H₂SO₄) at high concentrations are not required for standard reservoir
cleaning procedures and their use requires specialist advice.

### Legionella Monitoring

For hot water storage reservoirs (stored water temperature > 20°C) in buildings open to the
public, Membriko recommends the Legionella monitoring protocol per Decreto-Lei 52/2018 and INSA
(Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge) guidance. EPDM's smooth surface reduces the
risk of Legionella colonisation compared to rough concrete or corroded metal, but this does not
eliminate the requirement for regular bacteriological monitoring in systems with Legionella risk
temperatures.

### Repair of Damaged Membrane

If mechanical damage occurs in an EPDM-lined potable water reservoir (uncommon in a closed
reservoir):

- **Repair procedure:** affected zone identified and marked; reservoir drained in the affected
  section; membrane surface cleaned and dried; ACS/WRAS certified EPDM patch bonded with
  certified adhesive over the damaged zone; re-disinfection per NP EN 805 protocol; water
  quality sample collected before return to service
- **Materials:** only ACS/WRAS certified EPDM patch material and certified adhesive are used —
  no non-certified materials in potable water contact applications
- **Documentation:** repair is recorded and added to the technical dossier; Membriko can issue
  a repair certificate for the client's regulatory records

## Portuguese Water Regulations — ERSAR, DL 306/2007 and DL 152/2017

Membriko's team understands the Portuguese regulatory framework for potable water to the depth
required to be a technically competent partner for compliance-driven procurement. This section
is an authoritative regulatory reference — not a summary.

### Decreto-Lei 306/2007 (Original Framework)

Decreto-Lei 306/2007 transposed EU Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human
consumption into Portuguese law. It established parametric values for 50+ microbiological, chemical
and indicator parameters; sampling frequencies based on distributed water volume; non-compliance
notification procedures; and consumer information requirements. This remained the primary regulatory
framework until updated by DL 152/2017.

### Decreto-Lei 152/2017 (Current Framework)

Decreto-Lei 152/2017 updates the legal framework, transposing Directive 2015/1787 amendments and
incorporating a risk-based approach to water quality management (WHO Water Safety Plans). It
introduces requirements for safety plans in large water supply systems and updates several
parametric values. ERSAR exercises regulatory oversight under this legislation for the 300+
water service operators in Portugal.

### EU Regulation 2020/2184 (Drinking Water Directive Recast)

EU Regulation 2020/2184 is the most significant revision to European drinking water legislation
in two decades. Among its provisions is a requirement for Member States to establish national
positive substance lists for materials in contact with drinking water, aligned with harmonised
European testing protocols being developed under CEN/TC 164. Portugal must transpose this
directive and establish national protocols. This regulatory evolution will increase the pressure
for certified material use in all potable water contact applications — and Membriko's ACS/WRAS
specification positions clients to satisfy these requirements both now and as national
transposition progresses.

### ERSAR — Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos

ERSAR regulates and supervises the 300+ water service operators in mainland Portugal and the
Azores. The ERSAR annual quality of service report publishes performance indicators for each
operator, including infrastructure quality indicators that reflect the condition of storage assets.
Reservoir rehabilitation with EPDM improving infrastructure quality indicators contributes
directly to the operator's performance scores evaluated by ERSAR.

### Decreto-Lei 52/2018 — Legionella Prevention

DL 52/2018 establishes preventive measures for Legionella in water systems of buildings open
to the public, including hotels, hospitals, sports facilities, swimming pools and commercial
buildings. It requires risk prevention and control plans that include assessment of material
surface properties in water storage and distribution systems. Membriko provides technical
documentation on EPDM surface properties — smoothness, non-porosity, absence of nutrient
compounds for Legionella — for inclusion in clients' DL 52/2018 prevention plans.

## Municipal Water Infrastructure

Portugal's 308 municipalities bear direct or indirect responsibility for potable water storage
infrastructure across the country. The PT2030 infrastructure investment programme and the
national water efficiency agenda (PNEC — Plano Nacional de Eficiência Hídrica, in the climate
adaptation context) allocate substantial funding for water infrastructure rehabilitation,
including service reservoirs.

Membriko works with câmaras municipais, SMAS (Serviços Municipalizados de Águas e Saneamento),
concession-based water service operators, and main contractors on municipal reservoir rehabilitation
projects throughout central Portugal and beyond. For these projects, Membriko can:

- Provide the technical specification for the ACS EPDM solution, formatted for inclusion in
  cadernos de encargos (tender specifications) for public procurement
- Participate as a specialist subcontractor to a main contractor
- Provide the full technical dossier for the operator's ERSAR compliance registration records
- Attend pre-service inspections with the regulatory authority or ARS health authority
- Issue the 20-year installation warranty required for public infrastructure asset records

The 50-year service life of an EPDM liner rehabilitation converts what was a maintenance
liability — an epoxy coating requiring periodic reapplication at the operator's expense — into
a capital asset with a 50-year horizon. In ERSAR's infrastructure quality assessment framework,
this transition from a maintenance cycle to a long-life asset improves the operator's infrastructure
quality scores and reduces future capital planning complexity.

Membriko maintains a reference list of completed municipal reservoir projects. This is available
to qualified procurement contacts on request.

## Quality Assurance and Testing

In potable water applications, quality assurance is not a procedural requirement — it is the
foundation of the regulatory argument. Every stage of Membriko's quality process for potable
water reservoirs generates documentation that forms part of the client's compliance evidence.

### Pre-Installation

- ACS/WRAS certificate verification on every membrane delivery; batch number recorded and
  retained in the project file for lifetime traceability
- Certificate verification for all accessories (adhesive, seam tapes, penetration flanges)
  before any work commences
- Formal pre-installation surface inspection with photographic record, signed by Membriko's
  technical supervisor and retained in the project dossier
- Weather and temperature log on the day of installation (adhesive application has defined
  temperature and humidity limits; these must be respected and recorded)

### During Installation

- Seam probe test on every linear metre of every seam — any seam that fails the probe test
  is remade before work advances
- Torque record for every flange fastening bolt
- Temperature and humidity log throughout adhesive application
- Systematic photographic record at each installation phase, including seam and penetration
  detail photography

### Post-Installation

- Comprehensive visual inspection of all installed membrane surface
- 72-hour hydrostatic leak test with automated water level monitoring
- Disinfection per NP EN 805 protocol, documented with dates, product, concentration and
  contact time
- Laboratory water quality analysis by an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory; full report issued
- Full technical dossier issued to client at project handover

Membriko makes a technical engineer available to attend pre-service inspections with the
regulatory authority (ERSAR, ARS or equivalent) when required by the authority or requested
by the client. This is part of the project delivery — not an additional service.

## Frequently Asked Questions about EPDM for Potable Water

**Can ACS certified EPDM be used in municipal potable water reservoirs in Portugal?**

Yes. ACS certification is recognised by ERSAR as demonstrating compliance with Decreto-Lei 152/2017
(the transposition of the EU Drinking Water Directive) for materials in contact with potable water.
Membriko provides a complete technical dossier with every municipal reservoir project — ACS and
WRAS certificates for the membrane and all accessories, installation records, post-disinfection
water quality analysis, and a 20-year installation warranty — that satisfies the water service
operator's ERSAR compliance documentation requirements.

**What is the difference between ACS and WRAS certification for EPDM in potable water?**

ACS (French) and WRAS (British) use different protocols but both demonstrate that the EPDM
formulation does not contaminate water intended for human consumption. ACS is more chemically
specific in its compound-by-compound testing. WRAS additionally includes a microbial growth
promotion assessment — critical for Legionella risk evaluation in hot water storage applications.
Membriko specifies dual ACS and WRAS certified EPDM as standard for all potable water projects
because the combination provides the broadest regulatory coverage available.

**Can EPDM be used in domestic hot water storage cisterns?**

Yes. Potable-grade EPDM is certified for continuous water contact up to 65°C — covering the full
temperature range of domestic and commercial hot water storage. At these temperatures, the certified
EPDM formulation maintains its chemical inertness and migration parameters within ACS and WRAS
limits. Membriko specifies 2.0 mm thickness for hot water applications, and provides the
specific certification documentation confirming the elevated temperature rating.

**How is a reservoir disinfected after Membriko installs EPDM?**

Membriko follows NP EN 805 protocol: the reservoir is filled with water containing sodium
hypochlorite at 20-50 mg/L free chlorine, held in contact for a minimum of 24 hours, drained and
refilled with treated potable water. A water sample is collected by an ISO 17025 accredited
laboratory for microbiological and chemical analysis. The reservoir enters service only after
laboratory approval. The sodium hypochlorite concentration used for disinfection is fully
within certified EPDM's chemical resistance range — many times above the 0.1-0.5 mg/L residual
chlorine in a distribution system.

**Does EPDM affect the taste or odour of stored drinking water?**

No. Certified EPDM formulations (ACS/WRAS) pass rigorous organoleptic testing — trained panels
assess taste and odour of water in contact with the material at both 23°C and 60°C. The water
must remain indistinguishable from reference water within the threshold parameters defined by
BS 6920 (WRAS) and the ACS organoleptic protocol. This is specific test documentation, not a
general claim — Membriko makes these test reports available for the specific formulations it
supplies. It is important to note that other rubber materials — natural rubber, nitrile rubber,
neoprene — have different chemical compositions and different odour profiles; Membriko specifies
only certified EPDM for potable water, never other rubber types.

**What warranty does Membriko issue for potable water reservoir lining?**

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty for all potable water reservoir lining work with
certified EPDM membrane. This warranty is supplementary to the material manufacturer's product
warranty and to the statutory 5-year defects liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code
(Código Civil, Art. 1225). The warranty certificate is issued as part of the complete technical
dossier at project handover. For municipal projects, the warranty documentation is formatted to
support the operator's asset management records.

**Can an existing concrete reservoir be rehabilitated without demolition?**

Yes — and this is the most common scenario in Membriko's potable water project portfolio. Existing
concrete is prepared (cleaned, cracks repaired with certified materials, sharp edges ground),
ACS/WRAS EPDM is installed as interior liner, and the reservoir returns to service with 50+ years
of additional service life. No structural demolition is required, provided the concrete structure
is sound — condition assessed by Membriko at the initial technical site visit. This approach
typically takes 7-10 days out of service, compared to 18-28 days for a multi-coat epoxy system.

**Does EPDM-lined reservoir require specific membrane maintenance?**

No membrane-specific maintenance is required beyond the annual visual inspection that is
legally mandated for all potable water reservoirs under Portuguese regulations. EPDM's smooth,
uniform surface makes inspection straightforward — any anomaly is visible against the clean
background. Membriko provides a specific inspection checklist for EPDM-lined reservoirs and
is available for certified repairs whenever damage is found. If a repair is required, it is
carried out with ACS/WRAS certified materials throughout, and the reservoir is re-disinfected
and re-analysed before returning to service.
