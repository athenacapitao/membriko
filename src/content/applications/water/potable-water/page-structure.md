# Potable Water (Água Potável) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Potable water is the highest-stakes application category for EPDM waterproofing: the material
is in direct contact with water that will be consumed by human beings. The page must simultaneously
serve:

1. **Municipal water engineers and infrastructure managers** dealing with ageing reservoir stock
   and regulatory compliance requirements for ERSAR and the Drinking Water Directive
2. **Private property owners** with rural boreholes, springs or rainwater collection systems
   requiring certified potable water storage
3. **Architects and specifiers** for hospitals, hotels, schools and other institutional buildings
   requiring certified water storage materials

The persuasion architecture is built on a single foundational premise: when water is destined for
human consumption, the material it contacts cannot be chosen on price alone. It must be certified.
The page makes that case through regulatory evidence (what ERSAR and European directives require),
chemical evidence (what ACS and WRAS testing actually demonstrates), and comparative evidence
(what happens when non-certified materials are used). Membriko's 20-year installation warranty
and full certification documentation supply chain closes the argument.

Unlike swimming pools or irrigation canals, potable water storage involves national and European
law, public health responsibility, and regulatory oversight by ERSAR. This elevated regulatory
context is the page's structural backbone — it positions EPDM not as an optional upgrade but
as the technically correct specification choice.

## Section 1: Introduction — Safe Drinking Water Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Establish the gravity of the application and connect the reader's infrastructure
responsibility to the material specification decision.

**Content:**
- Frame: Portugal's water infrastructure — SMAS reservoirs serving towns and villages, private
  cisterns in rural quinta properties, hospital water towers, and condominium rooftop tanks all
  share one critical requirement: the material lining them must not contaminate the water
- The regulatory context: Decreto-Lei 152/2017 (EU Directive transposition) establishes 50+
  parametric values for drinking water quality. Any material in contact with potable water that
  causes these values to be exceeded is non-compliant. ERSAR audits and sanctions service providers.
- The Membriko position: EPDM certified to ACS and WRAS is the only flexible membrane material
  that combines 50+ year service life with documented potable water certification
- Stat block: ACS + WRAS dual certified / 0 ppb harmful migration / 50+ year service life /
  20-year Membriko installation warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Orçamento para Reservatório" / "Request Reservoir Quotation"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Potable Water — Certified Food-Safe

**Purpose:** The core technical argument — why EPDM is the correct specification for potable
water storage, grounded in chemistry rather than marketing.

**Content:**
- The contamination risk of non-certified materials: concrete without lining leaches calcium
  hydroxide (raises pH, alters taste); standard PVC releases phthalate plasticisers (regulated
  carcinogens); epoxy coatings degrade and release TOC into water; uncertified sealants
  introduce volatile organic compounds
- EPDM's chemical inertness: no plasticisers in the formulation; saturated polymer backbone
  does not undergo hydrolysis; vulcanisation residues tested and quantified below regulatory
  limits by ACS/WRAS protocols
- Zero migration: the ACS EN 12873 migration test demonstrates EPDM extract TOC below threshold
  values; specific compound analysis confirms absence of regulated contaminants
- Smooth surface: non-porous EPDM surface does not support biofilm attachment; Legionella risk
  minimised compared to rough concrete or corroded metal surfaces
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Potable-Grade EPDM | Test Method |
  |---|---|---|
  | ACS certification | Yes — France | Arrêté 29.05.1997 |
  | WRAS certification | Yes — UK | BS 6920 |
  | NSF/ANSI 61 | Yes (select grades) | NSF 61 |
  | KTW | Yes — Germany | Umweltbundesamt |
  | Organic migration | < 0.1 mg/L TOC | EN 12873 |
  | pH range | 5.5 to 9.5 | — |
  | Temperature (cold) | 0°C to 25°C | — |
  | Temperature (hot) | up to 65°C | — |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Section 3: Certification Standards — WRAS, NSF/ANSI 61, ACS, KTW

**Purpose:** Detailed explanation of the four principal certifications. This section is the
authoritative reference for specifiers and procurement officers who need to understand what
the certifications mean before including them in specifications.

**Content:** Four certification cards.

**ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire — France)**
- Issuing authority: French Ministère de la Santé via accredited laboratories
- Governing regulation: Arrêté du 29 mai 1997 as amended
- What it tests: migration of vulcanisation residues, zinc, antioxidants, carbon black
  extractables; odour panel testing; TOC of water extracts
- Significance: most chemically specific certification — tests for particular compounds
  rather than only aggregate extract parameters; recognised by ERSAR as ACS demonstration
  of compliance with Drinking Water Directive

**WRAS (Water Regulations Advisory Scheme — United Kingdom)**
- Issuing authority: WRAS Ltd (independent certification body)
- Governing standard: BS 6920
- What it tests: odour, taste, appearance, microbial growth promotion, metals extraction,
  organic compound extraction at 23°C and 60°C
- Significance: internationally recognised; includes microbial growth assessment missing
  from some other certification schemes; widely specified by UK water utilities

**NSF/ANSI 61 (United States and International)**
- Issuing authority: NSF International
- Governing standard: NSF/ANSI 61
- What it tests: EPA-protocol extraction testing against Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)
- Significance: required for materials in potable water systems in the United States; accepted
  in many international markets for internationally specified infrastructure projects

**KTW (Kunststoffe und Trinkwasser — Germany)**
- Issuing authority: German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt)
- Governing document: KTW Guideline with positive substance list
- Significance: substantially equivalent to ACS; required for materials entering German
  drinking water distribution networks; many formulations hold ACS and KTW concurrently

## Section 4: Application Types — Municipal Reservoirs, Private Tanks, Water Towers

**Purpose:** Demonstrate the range of potable water applications served by Membriko,
establishing credibility across both large infrastructure and residential scales.

**Content:** Application cards.

**Municipal Service Reservoirs (Reservatórios Municipais de Distribuição)**
- Context: Portugal has approximately 2,100 service reservoirs nationally; approximately 40%
  require rehabilitation within the next 15 years (ERSAR infrastructure data); many are
  unrelined concrete from the 1960s-1990s
- The Membriko solution: EPDM ACS liner installed inside existing concrete reservoir; restores
  watertightness, eliminates concrete leaching, creates smooth hygienic surface; service life
  matches 50-year infrastructure planning horizon
- ERSAR compliance documentation provided with every installation

**Private Domestic Cisterns (Cisternas Domésticas)**
- Context: rural properties in Portugal — quintas, herdades, agricultural holdings — relying
  on private boreholes or springs for potable water; PE cisterns offer limited capacity
  (< 10 m³) and 25-30 year service life; concrete cisterns with EPDM ACS liner offer
  unlimited volume and 50+ year service life
- The Membriko solution: new concrete cistern construction or rehabilitation of existing stone
  or concrete cistern, lined with ACS/WRAS EPDM; includes certification documentation for
  private water supply registration with the local health authority (ARS)

**Elevated Water Towers (Torres de Água)**
- Context: steel and concrete water towers in municipal distribution networks; thermal expansion
  of steel tanks requires flexible lining; EPDM's 400%+ elongation accommodates thermal movement
  without liner stress
- The Membriko solution: EPDM liner installed inside steel or concrete tower structure; penetration
  flanges for all inlet, outlet, level sensor and overflow connections certified to ACS/WRAS

**Institutional Water Storage (Hospitais, Hotéis, Edifícios)**
- Context: hospitals, large hotels, schools and industrial buildings with rooftop or basement
  potable water tanks; Legionella risk management requirements; audit trails required
- The Membriko solution: ACS/WRAS EPDM lining with full certification documentation for
  institutional compliance files; smooth surface supports Legionella risk management protocols

## Section 5: EPDM vs Epoxy, Stainless Steel and Concrete for Potable Water

**Purpose:** Head-to-head comparison of the principal alternative lining materials for potable
water storage. Framed as technical analysis, not competitive attack.

**Content:** Comparison table with 8 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Epoxy Coating | Stainless Steel | PE Cistern | Bare Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Potable certification | ACS + WRAS (dual) | Some products — verify | Yes (316L) | EN 12451 / ACS | No |
| Service life | 50+ years | 10-15 years | 30-50 years | 25-30 years | N/A — not adequate |
| Crack bridging | Excellent — 400% elongation | None — rigid | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Recoating required | No | Every 10-15 years | No | No (replacement) | N/A |
| Large volume capability | Unlimited | Unlimited | ~200 m³ practical | ~10 m³ | Unlimited |
| Legionella surface | Smooth — low risk | Degrades to rough | Smooth — low risk | Smooth | Rough — high risk |
| 50-year cost index | 100 | 280 (3-4 recoatings) | 350 | 180 (2 replacements) | N/A |
| ERSAR documentation | Full dossier | Partial | Full | Partial | Not applicable |

Honest acknowledgement: stainless steel tanks are the standard for small-volume pharmaceutical
and food-grade applications where contamination risk is highest; PE cisterns are a practical
and economical solution for volumes under 5 m³ and short asset lives. Membriko's position is
that for any application requiring 50-year performance, large volume, or the combination of
potable certification with structural crack bridging capability, EPDM is the superior specification.

---

## Section 6: Installation Process — Hygiene Protocols

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko's installation methodology is specifically designed for
potable water — not a generic waterproofing approach applied to a food-contact environment.

**Content:** 7-step numbered process.

1. **Coordenação com Engenheiro Sanitário / Sanitary Engineering Coordination** — All potable
   water reservoir projects begin with coordination with a registered sanitary engineer; ERSAR
   compliance requirements reviewed; reservoir sizing and system design confirmed
2. **Preparação da Estrutura** — Concrete preparation: cleaning, crack repair with approved
   materials; only products on the approved list for potable water contact are used in the
   reservoir interior; contractors working in the reservoir wear clean protective clothing
3. **Inspeção Pré-Instalação** — Pre-installation inspection: all surfaces reviewed; photographic
   record; independent quality sign-off before membrane installation begins
4. **Instalação da Membrana EPDM Certificada** — Installation of ACS/WRAS EPDM using certified
   adhesive systems; all materials in the certified supply chain; seaming with certified tapes
5. **Penetrações e Acessórios Certificados** — All penetrations (inlet, outlet, overflow, level
   sensors, access hatches) sealed with ACS/WRAS certified flanges and compression fittings;
   no non-certified sealants in water-contact zones
6. **Desinfeção e Análise** — Post-installation disinfection per NP EN 805; reservoir filled
   and disinfected with sodium hypochlorite; 24-hour contact time; water quality analysis by
   accredited laboratory before entry into service; results documented
7. **Dossiê e Garantia** — Complete technical dossier issued: ACS/WRAS certificates, installation
   record, water quality analysis, 20-year Membriko installation warranty certificate; ERSAR
   registration support documentation provided

---

## Section 7: Water Quality and EPDM — Taste, Odour, Migration Testing

**Purpose:** Address the consumer-level concerns about taste and odour (the most immediate
quality issues for potable water users) and explain what migration testing demonstrates.

**Content:**
- Why taste and odour matter: taste and odour are the first indicators consumers use to judge
  water quality; even if a contaminant is below its parametric value, taste and odour changes
  are unacceptable in public supply
- EPDM and taste: ACS organoleptic testing panels confirm certified EPDM formulations do not
  impart taste to water at either 23°C or 60°C contact conditions
- EPDM and odour: similarly confirmed by BS 6920 odour threshold testing
- What migration means: the EN 12873 test quantifies the mass of organic compound transferred
  from the material to water per unit volume; EPDM certified formulations produce extracts
  below 0.1 mg/L TOC — compare to European Drinking Water Directive parametric value for TOC
  of 5 mg/L (as a system indicator, not a direct limit)
- What migration does NOT mean: some internet commentary conflates EPDM with rubber compounds
  that are not EPDM; natural rubber, nitrile rubber, SBR, neoprene — none of these are EPDM
  and none should be used in potable water contact; the certification is specific to the EPDM
  formulation and must be documented by the manufacturer

---

## Section 8: Rehabilitation of Existing Reservoirs

**Purpose:** Capture the dominant use case — the rehabilitation of Portugal's ageing reservoir
infrastructure — with specific, practical information about what Membriko can work on.

**Content:**
- The rehabilitation opportunity: approximately 840 of Portugal's ~2,100 service reservoirs
  require rehabilitation within 15 years; additionally, tens of thousands of private cisterns
  in rural properties are reaching end of their useful life without internal lining
- What EPDM rehabilitation looks like: existing concrete surfaces prepared (blast cleaned
  or hydroblasted), minor cracks repaired with potable-water-safe materials, EPDM ACS liner
  installed; reservoir returned to service with 50+ year extension of asset life
- What EPDM can rehabilitate:
  - Unrelined concrete reservoirs (most common rehabilitation target)
  - Reservoirs with failed epoxy or bitumen coatings
  - Old stone or brick-lined cisterns (after assessment of structural soundness)
  - Steel tanks with corrosion of interior surfaces
- What requires additional engineering:
  - Structurally cracked concrete requiring injection grouting before liner
  - Reservoirs with active groundwater ingress through walls (injection before liner)
  - Reservoirs with contaminated water requiring decontamination treatment
- Speed advantage: a typical 500 m³ service reservoir rehabilitation with EPDM can be completed
  in 5-7 working days out of service, vs 15-25 days for a multi-coat epoxy system including
  curing time between coats

## Section 10: Maintenance and Disinfection

**Purpose:** Provide practical maintenance guidance for reservoir operators and property owners.

**Content:**
- Routine maintenance: annual visual inspection (legally required for all potable water
  reservoirs); check membrane for mechanical damage; inspect penetration seals; document
  inspection record for ERSAR audits
- Cleaning: EPDM can be cleaned with high-pressure water jets and food-safe disinfectants;
  sodium hypochlorite (1-2%) is the standard disinfectant for potable water reservoirs —
  fully compatible with certified EPDM; do not use acid cleaners without specialist advice
- Disinfection frequency: Portuguese guidance (following WHO and ECDC standards) recommends
  full reservoir disinfection at minimum annual intervals; after any repair work; and after
  any suspected contamination event
- Legionella monitoring: for water systems in the Legionella risk zone (stored water temperature
  20-45°C), Membriko recommends periodic bacteriological monitoring per HTM 04-01 / DL 52/2018
- Repair of EPDM: puncture or mechanical damage repaired with ACS/WRAS certified EPDM patch
  and certified adhesive; all repair materials in the certified supply chain; water quality
  test recommended after repair
- What to avoid: acid or solvent-based cleaners not compatible with potable water environments;
  metallic tools that could abrade the EPDM surface; non-certified sealants at penetration points

---

## Section 11: Portuguese Water Regulations — ERSAR, DL 306/2007 and DL 152/2017

**Purpose:** Authoritative regulatory reference section that positions Membriko as a technically
literate partner for compliance-driven procurement.

**Content:**
- **Decreto-Lei 306/2007** (original transposition of EU Drinking Water Directive 98/83/EC
  into Portuguese law): established the parametric values for water quality, sampling
  requirements, and reporting obligations; remained the primary framework until replaced
  by DL 152/2017
- **Decreto-Lei 152/2017** (current framework, transposing Directive 2015/1787 amendments):
  updated parameters, sampling schedules and risk-based water safety plan approach; ERSAR
  exercises regulatory oversight under this legislation
- **ERSAR** (Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos): the regulatory body
  that audits water service providers for compliance; infrastructure rehabilitation plans
  must demonstrate use of certified materials at reservoirs; ERSAR annual reports track
  compliance rates across the 300+ water service operators in Portugal
- **EU Regulation 2020/2184** (Drinking Water Directive recast, must be transposed by
  January 2023): introduces new requirements for materials in contact with drinking water;
  requires Member States to establish national positive substance lists; increases pressure
  for certified material use in all water contact applications
- **DL 52/2018** (Legionella prevention): regulates Legionella prevention in water systems
  in buildings open to the public; references material surface smoothness as a risk factor;
  EPDM's smooth surface is an advantage under this framework

---

## Section 12: Municipal Water Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Dedicated section for the municipal infrastructure procurement audience —
the SMAS engineers, câmara municipal technical departments, and water utility project managers
who are the primary decision-makers for service reservoir rehabilitation.

**Content:**
- Scale of the opportunity: ERSAR's 2023 annual report documents 2,100+ service reservoirs
  across Portugal; approximately 40% are unrelined concrete or have inadequate/degraded
  interior coatings; the rehabilitation programme is ongoing and substantially publicly funded
  under PT2030 infrastructure investment programmes
- Procurement framework: most municipal reservoir rehabilitation projects are procured through
  public tender (concurso público or ajuste direto depending on value); Membriko works with
  main contractors and can support the technical specification and method statement for
  EPDM-based rehabilitation
- Technical documentation package: Membriko provides for each municipal project: ACS/WRAS
  material certificates, CE declaration of performance (EN 13956), installation method
  statement, quality control plan, and post-installation water quality analysis
- Asset management advantage: a 50-year EPDM liner rehabilitation converts a maintenance
  liability (epoxy coating requiring periodic reapplication) into a capital asset with
  50-year horizon, improving the service provider's infrastructure assessment score under
  ERSAR's quality of service metrics
- References: Membriko has a reference list of completed municipal reservoir projects available
  to qualified procurement contacts on request

---

## Section 13: Quality Assurance and Testing

**Purpose:** Establish the rigour of Membriko's quality management approach for the highest-
stakes application in the portfolio.

**Content:**
- Pre-installation: material certification verification on every delivery; batch traceability
  record maintained; surface preparation inspection with photographic record before membrane
- During installation: seam probe testing on every linear metre of seam; penetration seal
  torque record for all flanged connections; weather and temperature log during adhesive
  application
- Post-installation: watertight test (72-hour water level monitoring with automated logging);
  water quality sample collected after disinfection fill; laboratory analysis by accredited
  laboratory (ISO 17025 accredited) for microbiological and chemical parameters
- Documentation: full quality dossier issued to client including material certificates,
  installation record, seam test log, water quality report, 20-year warranty certificate
- ERSAR audit support: Membriko's technical documentation is formatted to support ERSAR
  regulatory compliance audits; a Membriko engineer can attend pre-commissioning inspections
  if required by the regulatory authority

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales technical queries.

1. **O EPDM certificado ACS pode ser usado em reservatórios de água potável municipais?**
   Yes. ACS certification is recognised by ERSAR as demonstrating compliance with the Drinking
   Water Directive (DL 152/2017) for materials in contact with potable water. Membriko provides
   the full certification dossier required for ERSAR regulatory documentation with each municipal
   reservoir project.

2. **Qual a diferença entre certificação ACS e WRAS para EPDM em água potável?**
   ACS (France) and WRAS (UK) use different test protocols but both demonstrate that the EPDM
   formulation does not contaminate water intended for human consumption. ACS is more compound-
   specific in its testing; WRAS additionally includes a microbial growth assessment. Membriko
   uses EPDM with dual ACS and WRAS certification — the highest available standard.

3. **O EPDM pode ser utilizado em cisternas de água quente sanitária?**
   Yes. Potable-grade EPDM is certified for continuous water contact up to 65°C, covering the
   full temperature range of domestic and commercial hot water storage. At these temperatures,
   the certified EPDM formulation maintains its chemical inertness and migration parameters.

4. **Como é feita a desinfeção de um reservatório após instalação de EPDM?**
   Following NP EN 805 protocol: the reservoir is filled with water containing sodium hypochlorite
   at 20-50 mg/L free chlorine, left in contact for a minimum of 24 hours, then drained and
   refilled with treated potable water. A bacteriological and chemical water quality sample is
   taken by an accredited laboratory before the reservoir enters service. This level of chlorine
   concentration is fully within EPDM's chemical resistance range.

5. **O EPDM altera o sabor ou o cheiro da água potável?**
   No. Certified EPDM formulations (ACS/WRAS) pass rigorous organoleptic testing — trained
   panels assess taste and odour of water in contact with the material at both 23°C and 60°C.
   The water must be indistinguishable from reference water within defined threshold parameters.
   Uncertified rubber materials may impart taste or odour; this is why Membriko specifies only
   certified formulations for potable water applications.

6. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para revestimento de reservatórios de água potável?**
   Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty for all potable water reservoir lining work,
   supplementary to the material manufacturer's product warranty and the statutory 5-year defects
   liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Art. 1225). The warranty
   certificate and full technical dossier are issued at project handover.

7. **É possível instalar EPDM sobre betão antigo de um reservatório sem demolição?**
   Yes — this is the most common rehabilitation scenario. Membriko prepares the existing concrete
   surface (cleaning, crack repair with potable-water-safe materials, grinding of sharp edges),
   installs the ACS/WRAS EPDM liner, and returns the reservoir to service. No demolition is
   required provided the concrete structure is structurally sound. This rehabilitation approach
   typically extends the reservoir's service life by 50+ years.

8. **A membrana EPDM necessita de manutenção específica num reservatório de água potável?**
   No specific membrane maintenance is required beyond the routine annual visual inspection
   mandated for all potable water reservoirs. The smooth EPDM surface facilitates inspection
   — anomalies are visible against the uniform background. If mechanical damage occurs (rare
   in a closed reservoir), repair is carried out with ACS/WRAS certified patch material and
   adhesive, followed by a water quality analysis.
