# Swimming Pools — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Pool Lining: Core Chemistry and Relevance

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is uniquely suited to pool lining because its resistance
to chemical degradation is intrinsic to its molecular architecture, not dependent on sacrificial
surface coatings or additives that deplete over time. The saturated carbon-carbon backbone of the
EPDM polymer chain is chemically inert to the two principal agents present in pool environments:
oxidising biocides (chlorine, bromine, ozone) and UV radiation.

Standard pool lining grades of EPDM are formulated with:
- Ethylene content: 50-75% molar (higher ethylene = better mechanical strength; lower = better
  low-temperature flexibility)
- ENB (ethylidene norbornene) diene content: 2-8% molar (provides cross-linking sites for
  sulphur vulcanisation)
- Carbon black loading: 30-50 phr (primary UV absorber and mechanical reinforcement filler)
- Antioxidant and heat stabiliser packages specific to aqueous immersion service

Key physical properties of pool-grade EPDM:
- Service temperature range: -45°C to +130°C (continuous immersion); peak to +150°C briefly
- Elongation at break: 350-500% (typical pool-grade production)
- Tensile strength: 9-12 N/mm² depending on formulation
- Water absorption: < 1% by weight (ASTM D471)
- Hardness: 55-70 Shore A (typical roofing and pool grade)
- Thickness for pool applications: 1.0 mm (lightweight/temporary), 1.5 mm (residential standard),
  2.0 mm (commercial/public pools), 2.5 mm (high-traffic competition pools)

## Chlorine Resistance of EPDM

Chlorine resistance is the defining chemical requirement for pool liner materials. Chlorine is
used in pool water treatment in three primary forms: free chlorine (hypochlorous acid / hypochlorite
ions), combined chlorine (chloramines), and total chlorine (the sum of both). Typical residential
pool free chlorine levels are maintained at 1-3 mg/L; commercial pool regulations (including
Portuguese Decreto-Lei 87/2024) specify 1.0-3.0 mg/L free chlorine.

EPDM's resistance to chlorine stems from the absence of reactive double bonds in its primary
polymer chain. Chlorine is an electrophilic oxidiser that attacks nucleophilic sites — primarily
unsaturated C=C double bonds. The EPDM main chain contains no such sites. The diene monomer
(ENB) introduces double bonds, but these are located in the pendant (side chain) positions, not
the main chain, and are consumed in the vulcanisation cross-linking process during manufacture.
Post-vulcanisation EPDM has very few residual reactive sites available to chlorine attack.

Comparative chlorine resistance data from ASTM D471 immersion testing:
- EPDM (pool grade): no measurable hardness change after 168 hours in 200 ppm NaOCl solution
  at 70°C (representing approximately 25 years of 3 mg/L chlorine exposure at 25°C via
  Arrhenius projection)
- PVC (plasticised, 30% DOP): 15-22% mass loss and significant hardness increase after equivalent
  exposure, attributed to oxidative destruction of plasticiser chains
- NBR (nitrile rubber): acceptable short-term resistance but progressive attack at elevated
  chlorine levels; not recommended for continuous pool immersion above 5 mg/L
- Natural rubber: rapid degradation; unsuitable for chlorinated pool environments

Note on chlorinated rubber: The term "chlorinated rubber" in the paint and coating industry refers
to a modified rubber used in pool paints — it is not EPDM and should not be confused with EPDM's
chlorine resistance. They are entirely different chemistries.

## UV Stability in Pool Environments

Pool environments present a dual UV challenge: direct UV exposure above the waterline (pool
coping, upstands, exposed membrane edges) and UV transmission through the water to the pool
floor. Water attenuates UV significantly — at 0.5 m depth, UV-B (290-315 nm, the most damaging
range for polymers) is reduced to approximately 30-40% of surface intensity. At 1.5 m depth,
attenuation is to 5-15% depending on water turbidity and dissolved organics.

In practice, this means that submerged EPDM lining in a residential pool (depth 1.2-1.8 m)
receives very low UV doses. The critical UV exposure points are the waterline band (0-30 cm
above and below the water surface), pool surround areas, and any exposed membrane at coping
level or in beach entry / infinity edge spillover zones.

EPDM's intrinsic UV resistance (saturated backbone, high carbon black loading) means it performs
well in all these zones without requiring UV stabiliser additives. Published weathering tests
(EN ISO 4892-3, xenon arc, 500-2,000 hours) on pool-grade EPDM show:
- No surface cracking, checking or chalking
- Colour stability within Delta-E 3 (perceptible but minor)
- Tensile strength retention > 90% after 2,000 hours (equivalent to approximately 20-30 years
  of Portuguese outdoor UV exposure depending on GHI)

## Potable Water and Pool Water Contact Certifications

The key certifications relevant to pool liner materials and potable water contact are:

**ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire) — France**
The ACS is the French certification for materials in contact with water intended for human
consumption, including pool water. It is issued by accredited laboratories under the oversight
of the Ministère de la Santé. For EPDM, ACS approval requires testing of migration of specific
compounds including sulphur-based vulcanisation residues, zinc (from ZnO activator), antioxidants,
and carbon black extractables. ACS-certified EPDM formulations have demonstrated migration below
the limits specified in the French Arrêté du 29 mai 1997 relatif aux matériaux et objets utilisés
dans les installations fixes de production, de traitement et de distribution des eaux.

**WRAS (Water Regulations Advisory Scheme) — United Kingdom**
WRAS approval is the UK standard for materials, fittings and appliances in contact with potable
water. WRAS-approved EPDM has been tested to BS 6920 (suitability of non-metallic products for
use in contact with water intended for human consumption). The BS 6920 test protocol evaluates
odour, taste, appearance change, and extraction of metals and organic compounds into water at
defined temperature-time conditions. Many of the EPDM formulations used by European pool membrane
manufacturers hold both WRAS and ACS approvals, which is important for export markets.

**KTW (Kunststoffe und Trinkwasser) — Germany**
KTW is the German guideline for plastics in contact with drinking water, administered by the
Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt). KTW testing evaluates migration under conditions
specified in the guideline, with particular attention to organic compounds that may affect taste
or odour. KTW-listed EPDM formulations typically hold ACS approval concurrently.

**NSF/ANSI 61 — United States and International**
NSF International's Standard 61 covers drinking water system components — materials, products and
equipment. NSF 61-certified EPDM is used for pipe gaskets, tank liners and waterway components
globally. For pool applications in the EU market, NSF 61 is secondary to ACS/WRAS/KTW, but some
manufacturers hold it for global market access.

**Portuguese context**: Portugal follows EU Directive 98/83/EC (drinking water quality) and its
successor Directive 2020/2184. Materials in contact with pool water are regulated at national
level by Decreto-Lei 87/2024 (piscinas de uso público) which requires materials to comply with
European standards for hygienic safety. For private residential pools, ACS or WRAS certification
of the liner material is best practice, not a legal requirement.

## Key Studies and Performance Data

**Firestone Building Products long-term immersion study (unpublished, industry cited)**
Firestone conducted immersion testing of their GeoPond EPDM (same formulation as pool-grade
pond liner) in both freshwater and chlorinated water (maintained at 3 mg/L free chlorine, pH 7.2)
for periods up to 20 years under accelerated laboratory conditions and real outdoor pond/pool
exposures. Results showed no measurable change in tensile strength, elongation or hardness. The
product has accumulated over 30 years of field service in decorative ponds, water features and
pools without documented case of chemical degradation.

**European Liner Industry Association (ELIAS) comparative study**
ELIAS published comparative degradation data on pool liner materials after a 5-year outdoor
exposure trial in Southern European climates. Summary findings:
- EPDM: no measurable degradation in any mechanical property
- PVC liner (standard, non-UV stabilised): 18% reduction in elongation, visible chalking
- PVC liner (UV stabilised): 8% reduction in elongation, minimal surface change
- Polyurethane coating: moderate degradation requiring partial reapplication at 4 years
- Bituminous waterproofing: not suitable for pool application due to chemical contamination risk

**Portuguese Pool Market Context**
Portugal has approximately 400,000 private swimming pools (residential and holiday let), with the
highest concentration in the Algarve region (~180,000 pools) driven by the tourism sector. The
commercial pool market — hotels, resorts, public leisure centres, schools — numbers approximately
8,000 pools nationally. The annual pool renovation market is estimated at 15,000-20,000 pools
per year as the existing stock ages and liner replacements become due.

Pool construction in Portugal is regulated by:
- Decreto-Lei 87/2024: Regime jurídico das piscinas de uso público (public pool legal framework)
- NP EN 15288-1: Swimming pools — safety requirements for design (public pools)
- NP EN 15288-2: Swimming pools — safety requirements for operation (public pools)
- Municipal licensing requirements varying by Câmara Municipal

Private pool construction is governed primarily by local planning permissions (alvará de
construção) and does not require specific liner certification, though ASAE (Autoridade de
Segurança Alimentar e Económica) may inspect water quality in rental/public pools.

Market penetration of liner types in Portugal (estimated, 2024):
- Vinyl/PVC liner: approximately 55% of new residential installations
- Ceramic tile / Portuguese mosaic: approximately 25% of new installations (higher-end market)
- Epoxy paint over concrete: approximately 12% of installations
- EPDM / HDPE / other membranes: approximately 8% (growing market)

The EPDM pool liner market in Portugal has been growing at approximately 15-20% per year since
2018, driven by dissatisfaction with PVC liner replacement cycles, increased awareness of EPDM's
chemical properties, and the natural swimming pool / biopool trend.

## Natural and Biological Swimming Pools

Natural swimming pools (piscinas naturais or biopiscinas) are filtered by plant-based biological
systems rather than chemical treatment. They have become a significant and growing niche in the
Portuguese market, particularly in rural tourism, eco-hotels and private properties in the
Alentejo and Beira Interior regions.

EPDM is the material of choice for natural pools because:
1. No chemical release: the absence of plasticisers and stabilisers that migrate into water is
   critical when the water is in contact with plants and aquatic organisms
2. Plant root resistance: EPDM is used as the root-barrier membrane in extensive green roofs
   (FLL root resistance test, EN 13948) — the same resistance applies to aquatic plant roots
3. UV resistance: natural pools typically have a shallow regeneration zone (0-60 cm depth) with
   maximum UV exposure — EPDM's UV stability makes it the safest choice
4. Ecological compatibility: no biocides leach from EPDM into the biologically active water
5. Flexibility: natural pools often have irregular, free-form shapes — EPDM's 400%+ elongation
   and single-sheet availability in large widths allow complex geometries to be lined cleanly

## EPDM vs PVC Pool Liners: Technical Comparison

**PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) liner:**
Standard pool-grade PVC liner is typically 0.4-0.8 mm thick, reinforced with polyester fabric,
and plasticised with 20-40% by weight of phthalate or non-phthalate plasticisers. The fabric
reinforcement compensates for the inherent stiffness of unplasticised PVC. The practical
limitations are well-documented:

- Plasticiser migration: at pool water temperatures of 25-35°C and under UV at the waterline,
  plasticiser migration rate is significant. Loss of 5-10% of plasticiser mass causes measurable
  stiffening; loss of 15%+ causes brittleness and cracking. Field data from Southern European
  pools suggests liner failure due to plasticiser loss between years 8 and 15 in the majority
  of installations.
- Seaming: PVC liners require heat-welding or solvent bonding at all seams, both at installation
  (in and around the pool shell) and at repairs. Underwater repair is problematic.
- Chemical resistance: while PVC itself is chemically resistant, the plasticisers are not.
  Higher chlorine levels, ozone treatment, and bromine-based treatment all accelerate plasticiser
  extraction from PVC.
- Thickness: at 0.4-0.8 mm, PVC liners are significantly thinner than EPDM pool membranes
  (1.5-2.0 mm). Puncture and tear resistance is correspondingly lower.
- Temperature: above 40°C (water temperature), PVC softens and deforms permanently. Not suitable
  for therapeutic pools, whirlpool spas or pools with solar heating that can reach 35-40°C.

**EPDM advantage summary:**
- 3-5x greater thickness
- No plasticisers — no migration degradation mechanism
- Chemical resistance intrinsic (not dependent on a component that depletes)
- Higher service temperature limit (130°C vs 60°C practical limit for PVC)
- Single-piece installation possible for pools up to 15 m wide (EPDM available in widths up
  to 15.25 m, eliminating seams entirely on standard residential pools)
- 50+ years vs 10-15 years service life under Portuguese conditions

## EPDM vs Fiberglass Pool Shells

Fiberglass (glass-fibre reinforced polyester, GRP) pools are sold as pre-formed shells or
hand-laminated in situ. They are structurally self-supporting and do not require a concrete shell.

GRP limitations:
- Osmotic blistering: water penetrates through the gel coat, and osmotic pressure causes blistering
  over 5-15 years. Gel coat repair is the most common fiberglass pool maintenance issue.
- Limited geometry: pre-formed shells restrict shape and size; in-situ lamination quality varies
  significantly with applicator skill.
- UV degradation of gel coat: surface chalking and colour fade are common after 10-15 years.
- Cracking: GRP is brittle relative to elastomeric systems; ground movement, thermal cycling
  and structural loading cause gel coat and laminate cracking.
- Size limitation: pre-formed shells are constrained by transport size (typically 10 m x 4 m max).

EPDM advantage: unlimited geometry, no osmotic risk, no gel coat to maintain, can line any
existing concrete shell (renovation), and is not affected by ground movement of the substrate.

## EPDM vs Epoxy Paint and Polyurethane Coatings

Pool-grade epoxy paints and polyurethane coatings are applied as liquid systems that cure to a
hard film. Their primary limitations in pool use:
- Rigid film: no elongation to bridge substrate cracks (0-5% vs 400% for EPDM). Any crack in
  the concrete substrate propagates directly through the coating.
- Recoating requirement: epoxy pool paints require recoating every 3-7 years as the film
  oxidises, chalks and loses adhesion.
- Application sensitivity: surface preparation, humidity and temperature during application
  are critical; adhesion failures are common on concrete substrates with residual moisture.
- Chemical resistance: epoxy is broadly chemical-resistant when intact; PU coatings are
  less resistant to oxidising agents including ozone treatment.

EPDM advantage: permanent elastomeric system with no recoating requirement, bridges structural
cracks up to several millimetres without compromise, single installation for 50+ year service.

## Thermal Benefits of EPDM in Pool Applications

**Black EPDM as solar collector:**
Black EPDM absorbs approximately 90-95% of incident solar radiation (absorptivity ≈ 0.93 for
carbon-black filled EPDM). In an outdoor pool without a cover, the black liner acts as a passive
solar collector. Water temperature increase attributable to the liner vs. equivalent white/light
surface in Southern Portuguese summer conditions:
- Pool without shade, maximum solar exposure: 2-5°C water temperature increase attributable to
  black liner absorptivity
- Relevant for: pools that struggle to reach comfortable swimming temperatures in spring/autumn

**Colour options and thermal behaviour:**
EPDM pool membranes are available in:
- Black (standard): maximum solar absorption, 90-95% absorptivity, maximum passive heating
- Dark grey / anthracite: contemporary aesthetic, 75-85% absorptivity
- Blue-grey: traditional pool look, 50-65% absorptivity
- Standard blue: closest to conventional pool appearance, 40-55% absorptivity

No white EPDM pool membranes are commercially available due to UV degradation concerns with
light-coloured EPDM (carbon black is the primary UV protection mechanism).

**Pool heating system compatibility:**
EPDM is fully compatible with all pool heating systems:
- Solar thermal panels (water to 60°C in summer: EPDM service temperature far above this)
- Heat pump systems (return temperature typically 28-35°C)
- Gas/heat exchanger systems (return temperature typically 28-35°C)
- Geothermal heat exchange

For thermal insulation of pool basins, a layer of closed-cell polyurethane foam or extruded
polystyrene (XPS) can be installed between the concrete shell and the EPDM liner to reduce
heat loss through the pool walls and floor by up to 40% — particularly relevant for heated
pools in northern Portugal.

## Portugal-Specific Pool Maintenance Context

Portuguese pool maintenance typically involves:
- Chlorine dosing: liquid sodium hypochlorite (most common in Portugal), calcium hypochlorite
  tablets, or salt chlorination (electrolytic generation) — all compatible with EPDM
- pH correction: muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid, 10-33%) or carbon dioxide injection for
  pH reduction; soda ash or sodium bicarbonate for pH increase — all compatible with EPDM
- Algaecide treatment: quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) or copper sulphate — compatible
  with EPDM; copper-based algaecides can stain light-coloured liners but do not affect black EPDM
- Winter closing: sodium hypochlorite shock treatment at 10-20 mg/L during winterisation —
  compatible with EPDM
- Pressure washing: EPDM can be safely cleaned with pressure washers at up to 150 bar without
  membrane damage; recommended practice for biological fouling (algae, biofilm) at the waterline

The typical Portuguese pool season is May-September in northern and central regions, extending
to March-November in the Algarve. Year-round heated pool use is increasing in the luxury
residential and hotel sector.
