# Swimming Pools — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Swimming pools represent one of the most chemically aggressive environments for any waterproofing
membrane, and also one of the most visible and emotionally significant investments a homeowner or
hotel operator makes. The swimming pool page must serve three distinct audiences simultaneously:

1. **Residential pool owners** seeking a durable lining that ends the PVC replacement cycle
2. **Commercial and hotel operators** who understand total cost of ownership and regulatory
   compliance requirements for public pools
3. **Natural / biological pool builders** and their clients seeking an ecologically safe liner

The persuasion architecture follows a specific arc: first establish the pain of existing solutions
(especially PVC liner failure, which most Portuguese pool owners have experienced or know someone
who has), then deliver the chemistry-based case for EPDM, then address pool-type diversity
(residential, commercial, natural), then provide the comparative data, then close with the
Membriko process and regulatory context. FAQs capture the long-tail search terms specific to
pool lining.

Portugal's pool culture — particularly in the Algarve and among returning emigrants (retornados
and diaspora) who build their first pool as a status marker in their village property — is a
meaningful cultural frame that can humanise the opening section without condescension.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Pool Culture and the Lining Problem

**Purpose:** Create connection to the reader's context before presenting technical solutions.

**Content:**
- Open with the Portuguese pool as a cultural symbol: the proliferation of pools across the
  Alentejo, Ribatejo and Algarve countryside, the quintas and herdades with pools at the
  centre of family life, the hotel and resort pools of the Algarve as economic infrastructure
- The problem: most of these pools are lined with PVC or painted with epoxy — materials that
  fail predictably within 10-15 years. The reader likely knows this. Their liner is yellowing,
  stiffening, bubbling, or has already been replaced once.
- The Membriko answer: EPDM is the material that ends the replacement cycle. One installation,
  correctly executed, for 50+ years.
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / 400% elongation / 100% chlorine resistant / 20-year
  Membriko warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação Gratuita"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Swimming Pools

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the chemistry argument for why EPDM outperforms all
alternatives in the specific pool environment.

**Content:**
- The two chemical aggressors in every pool: oxidising biocides (chlorine, bromine, ozone) and
  UV radiation at the waterline
- EPDM's saturated polymer backbone: no reactive double bonds for chlorine to attack; no
  plasticiser to extract; no gel coat to blister
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Pool-Grade EPDM | Test Method |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness | 1.5 mm (residential) / 2.0 mm (public) | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | Free chlorine resistance | Up to 5 mg/L — no degradation | ASTM D471 |
  | Water pH range | 6.5 to 8.5 | — |
  | Water temperature | 0°C to 50°C | — |
  | UV resistance | No surface degradation | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |
- Certifications: ACS (France), WRAS (UK), KTW (Germany) — no plasticiser migration into
  pool water

## Section 3: Pool Types — Residential, Commercial, Natural

**Purpose:** Establish that Membriko's EPDM solution is appropriate for every pool type and
scale, not just residential.

**Content:** Three pool type cards.

**Residential Pools (Piscinas Residenciais)**
- Context: the 400,000+ private pools in Portugal; typical size 25-60 m²; common issues with
  PVC liner replacement
- EPDM benefit: 1.5 mm membrane lasts 50+ years vs PVC liner at 10-15 years; available in
  blue, grey and black for aesthetic choice
- Installation note: single sheet possible for most residential pools (up to 15 m wide without
  seam), eliminating the most vulnerable point of any liner system

**Commercial and Hotel Pools (Piscinas Comerciais e Hoteleiras)**
- Context: 8,000+ commercial pools in Portugal; Algarve hotel sector as primary market;
  regulatory pressure from Decreto-Lei 87/2024; high-frequency maintenance environments
- EPDM benefit: 2.0 mm membrane rated for public use; ACS/WRAS certification satisfies
  regulatory due diligence; 20-year warranty compatible with hotel asset financing cycles
- Note on competition pools: 2.5 mm EPDM for high-traffic use; skimmer and return inlet
  accessories designed for commercial flow rates

**Natural and Biological Swimming Pools (Piscinas Naturais / Biopiscinas)**
- Context: growing trend in eco-tourism, rural tourism and luxury residential; chemical-free
  filtration via planted regeneration zones; flourishing in Alentejo and Beira Interior
- EPDM benefit: no plasticisers or stabilisers that contaminate biologically active water;
  root-resistant membrane (same root resistance tested for green roofs per EN 13948); UV-stable
  in the shallow regeneration zone where UV exposure is maximum
- Ecological note: EPDM is recyclable at end of service life; no chemical contamination of
  surrounding soil or groundwater

## Section 4: Chemical Resistance — Chlorine, Bromine, Salt and Ozone

**Purpose:** Address the #1 technical objection and concern for pool owners: "Will the membrane
be damaged by pool chemicals?"

**Content:**
- Detailed explanation of why EPDM resists chlorine where PVC does not (saturated backbone
  vs plasticiser extraction)
- Resistance to all major Portuguese pool treatment systems:
  - Liquid sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl): most common in Portugal; EPDM fully resistant
  - Calcium hypochlorite tablets (CCl): concentrated but still within EPDM's resistance range
  - Salt chlorination (chlorine electrolysis): generates hypochlorous acid at lower levels;
    EPDM fully compatible with saltwater up to seawater concentration
  - Bromine treatment: full resistance; often used in indoor heated pools
  - Ozone treatment: ozone is a known rubber degradant for unsaturated rubbers but does NOT
    attack EPDM's saturated backbone; fully compatible
  - UV sanitation (UV-C lamps): generates trace ozone and hydrogen peroxide; EPDM compatible
- pH resistance: stable across pH 4-12; standard pool pH 7.2-7.8 is well within range
- Algaecide compatibility: quaternary ammonium compounds (standard Portuguese algaecides)
  are fully compatible with EPDM

## Section 6: Renovation of Existing Pools

**Purpose:** Capture the substantial renovation market — pool owners with failing liners or
tiles seeking an alternative to complete reconstruction.

**Content:**
- The renovation case: most Portuguese pools are 10-25 years old and facing first or second
  liner replacement; complete reconstruction (demolish and rebuild shell) is expensive and
  disruptive; EPDM overlay is the cost-effective alternative
- What EPDM can be installed over:
  - Existing PVC liner (if well-adhered and free of major bubbles)
  - Ceramic tiles and mosaics (if well-adhered; sharp grout joints require filling)
  - Concrete shell (direct application with preparation)
  - Painted epoxy surface (after mechanical keying)
- What it cannot be installed over:
  - Delaminating or lifting tiles (must be removed)
  - Active leaking structural cracks (must be repaired before liner)
  - Surfaces with active biological contamination (must be chemically treated first)
- Process note: renovation installation is typically faster than new-build — 2-3 days for a
  standard residential renovation vs 3-5 days for new-build with curing delays
- Cost comparison: EPDM renovation vs complete reconstruction vs PVC liner replacement

## Section 7: Natural and Biological Pools — Special Requirements

**Purpose:** Serve the growing natural pool segment with content that demonstrates Membriko
understands the specific requirements of chemical-free water systems.

**Content:**
- What is a natural swimming pool: the two-zone system (swimming zone + regeneration zone
  with aquatic plants acting as biofilter); typically no chemical treatment; filtered by
  plants, substrate and microbial communities
- Why EPDM is the only correct choice: no plasticiser release that would disrupt the
  biological filter ecosystem; root-resistant (FLL-tested, EN 13948); UV-stable in the
  regeneration zone where plant roots grow close to the surface
- Design considerations for natural pools:
  - Irregular geometry: EPDM in widths to 15.25 m accommodates free-form shapes
  - Planting strips: EPDM can be penetrated cleanly for plant root zones with purpose-made
    penetration details
  - Beach entry zones: gradual gradient EPDM installation with anchored coping at the
    water's edge
- Environmental note: EPDM contains no biocides, heavy metals or plasticisers that
  contaminate the ecological water system or surrounding soil

## Section 8: EPDM vs PVC Liner / Fiberglass / Concrete Paint / Mosaic Tiles

**Purpose:** Proactively handle competitor comparison objections. Framed as objective analysis,
not a competitive attack.

**Content:** Comparison table with 7 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | PVC Liner | Fiberglass | Epoxy Paint | Mosaic / Tile |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 10-15 years | 20-30 years (gel coat) | 3-7 years | 20-30 years (joints) |
| Thickness | 1.5-2.0 mm | 0.4-0.8 mm | 5-10 mm | 0.2-0.5 mm | 7-12 mm |
| Chlorine resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Moderate — plasticisers migrate | Good | Good initially | Good (joints degrade) |
| Structural crack bridging | Excellent — 400% elongation | Moderate | Poor — brittle | None | Poor — tiles delaminate |
| Renovation application | Yes — over tiles/concrete | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Plasticisers in water | None | Yes — phthalates | None | None | None |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 180 (2 replacements) | 140 | 220 (5 reapplications) | 130 |

Honest acknowledgement paragraph: tile and mosaic finishes offer an aesthetic quality that EPDM
cannot match; fiberglass shells are structurally superior for free-standing above-ground pools;
for owners where aesthetics are the primary driver and budget allows, these alternatives are
legitimate. Membriko's position is that for anyone prioritising 50-year durability, chemical
neutrality and total cost of ownership, EPDM is the only rational choice.

## Section 9: Thermal Benefits

**Purpose:** Address the passive heating advantage of dark EPDM and compatibility with all
pool heating systems.

**Content:**
- Solar absorption of black EPDM: absorptivity 0.93 — absorbs 93% of incident solar radiation;
  translates to 2-5°C higher pool water temperature vs light-coloured liners in Portuguese
  summer conditions
- Colour options: black (maximum heating), dark grey, blue-grey, standard blue — and their
  respective thermal properties
- Compatibility with pool heating systems: solar thermal, heat pump, gas/heat exchanger,
  geothermal; EPDM service temperature range of 0-130°C comfortably exceeds all heating
  system return temperatures
- Pool insulation option: closed-cell PU foam or XPS between shell and EPDM; up to 40%
  reduction in heat loss through walls and floor for heated pools

## Section 11: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that EPDM pools require less ongoing maintenance than alternatives,
and provide practical guidance.

**Content:**
- Annual maintenance requirements: minimal; standard pool water chemistry maintenance; no
  liner-specific maintenance required
- Cleaning: EPDM can be brushed, pressure-washed (up to 150 bar), or chemically cleaned with
  standard pool algaecides without membrane damage
- Inspection: visual inspection at each pool season opening; check waterline band (highest UV
  exposure point) and skimmer/inlet seal points; check for any mechanical damage from pool
  cleaning equipment
- Repair procedure if puncture occurs: EPDM repair patches can be applied underwater in
  emergency using Bostik EPDM underwater adhesive; permanent repair requires pool draining and
  patch bonding in dry conditions — typical repair time 2-4 hours for a single puncture
- What to avoid: sharp tools near the membrane; abrasive pool cleaning robots with metal
  brushes; high-concentration chemical shock treatment directly on the membrane (dilute first)
- Membriko annual inspection offer: optional annual technical inspection with written report

## Section 12: Portuguese Regulations

**Purpose:** Eliminate regulatory doubt for public pool operators and hotel clients.

**Content:**
- Decreto-Lei 87/2024 (Regime jurídico das piscinas de uso público):
  Requires pool materials to comply with European health and safety standards; water
  quality monitoring requirements (free chlorine 1.0-3.0 mg/L, pH 7.2-7.6, turbidity,
  microbiological parameters); EPDM certified to ACS/WRAS meets the material hygiene
  requirements; Membriko provides certification documentation
- NP EN 15288-1 / NP EN 15288-2 (Design and operation of public pools):
  Pool structure must be watertight; membrane system must be appropriate for the use class;
  penetrations (skimmers, inlets, drains) must be sealed to the membrane by approved methods
- ASAE inspection context: Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica inspects public pools
  for water quality compliance; a certified EPDM liner with ACS/WRAS documentation
  demonstrates regulatory due diligence
- Private residential pools: no specific liner material regulations; licensing is via local
  municipality (alvará de construção / licença de utilização); best practice is to use
  ACS/WRAS-certified EPDM for health assurance
- Environmental licensing: pools near protected areas, coastal zones (Reserva Ecológica
  Nacional) or water bodies may require specific environmental impact assessment; EPDM's
  absence of plasticiser migration is an advantage in these applications

---

## Section 13: Design Options and Aesthetics

**Purpose:** Address the aesthetic dimension — the concern that EPDM looks "industrial" compared
to tile or fibreglass.

**Content:**
- Colour palette: deep black (contemporary design, natural pool aesthetic), dark grey
  (neutral, versatile), blue-grey (modern residential), standard blue (closest to
  conventional pool appearance)
- Infinity edge pools: EPDM is well-suited to infinity and overflow pools; the membrane
  lines both the main pool basin and the collection channel without requiring complex seaming;
  the hidden overflow channel is often EPDM even in tile-finished pools
- Beach entry and gradual slope designs: EPDM's flexibility allows smooth installation on
  any gradient without buckling
- Raised and above-ground pools: EPDM can line timber, steel or concrete above-ground
  structures with perimeter clamping profiles
- Pool surrounds: complementary EPDM applications for pool decking waterproofing (terrace
  waterproofing below the pavement finish) and the transition between pool and terrace
- Combination with tile: some clients choose EPDM for the pool floor and steps (durability)
  with a tile band at the waterline (aesthetic). Membriko has experience with this hybrid
  approach and can advise on the correct detail at the EPDM-to-tile transition.

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales queries.

1. **Posso instalar membrana EPDM numa piscina existente com azulejos antigos?**
   Yes — provided the tiles are well-adhered. Loose or hollow tiles must be removed and the
   surface levelled before membrane application. EPDM over existing tiles is a common and
   cost-effective renovation approach that avoids expensive ceramic demolition.

2. **O EPDM preto vai aquecer demasiado a água da minha piscina no verão?**
   Black EPDM increases passive solar heating by 2-5°C compared to lighter-coloured liners.
   In most of Portugal this is a benefit for the longer swimming season. For clients in the
   Algarve who wish to moderate this effect, blue-grey or standard blue options are available.

3. **É possível instalar EPDM numa piscina de forma livre (kidney, L, curva)?**
   Yes. EPDM membranes are available in widths up to 15.25 m and are cut and seamed to fit
   any pool geometry, however irregular. The membrane's 400%+ elongation means it conforms
   to curved surfaces and internal angles without wrinkling or stress concentrations.

4. **O EPDM é seguro para piscinas naturais sem tratamento químico?**
   Yes — EPDM is the material of choice for natural swimming pools. It contains no plasticisers,
   biocides or heavy metals that could contaminate biologically filtered water or harm the
   aquatic plant ecosystem in the regeneration zone. It is also root-resistant per EN 13948.

5. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para impermeabilização de piscinas?**
   Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty on all pool lining work, supplementary
   to the manufacturer's product warranty and to the 5-year statutory defects liability period
   under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Art. 1225). The warranty certificate is
   delivered to the client at project handover.

6. **Posso usar cloro de choque a alta concentração sem danificar a membrana EPDM?**
   Yes. Shock treatment (super-chlorination) at 10-20 mg/L free chlorine is fully within EPDM's
   chemical resistance range. Best practice is to pre-dilute the shock dose in a bucket of
   water before adding to the pool to avoid localised high-concentration contact with any pool
   surface material.

7. **O EPDM de piscina é o mesmo que o EPDM de cobertura?**
   The base polymer chemistry is the same, but pool-grade EPDM is formulated and certified
   specifically for continuous immersion in chemically treated water. The key differences are
   the antioxidant package (selected for aqueous immersion), the ACS/WRAS certification testing,
   and the thickness grades (1.5-2.0 mm for pools vs 1.0-1.5 mm for many roofing applications).
   Membriko specifies only pool-certified EPDM for water contact applications.

8. **Quanto tempo dura a instalação e quando posso usar a piscina depois?**
   A standard residential pool of 40-60 m² takes 3-5 days from preparation to completion.
   After installation, the pool is filled gradually and monitored for 72 hours before the
   client's first use. Chemical start-up (pH adjustment and initial chlorination) is carried
   out before swimming. Total time from start of preparation to first swim is typically 5-8 days.
