# Swimming Pool Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Portugal's Pool Culture and the Waterproofing Challenge

Portugal has more than 400,000 private swimming pools. They line the terraces of Algarve villas, fill the courtyards of Alentejo quintas, anchor the gardens of returning emigrants who built their family home after decades abroad, and occupy the grounds of the hotels and resorts on which the country's tourism economy runs. A swimming pool in Portugal is rarely just infrastructure. It is a statement of arrival, a gathering place, and, for the commercial sector, a central pillar of competitive positioning in a market where guests choose between properties largely on the basis of the pool experience.

Every single one of those pools has a lining problem — whether the owner knows it yet or not.

The vast majority of Portugal's pool stock is lined with plasticised PVC liner or coated with epoxy paint. Both materials fail predictably. PVC liners yellow, stiffen, bubble, and split between eight and fifteen years of service, driven by the progressive loss of plasticisers that leach into the pool water under the combined effect of chlorine, UV radiation, and elevated summer water temperatures. Epoxy coatings crack at every movement point in the concrete shell — and concrete always moves, through thermal cycling, ground settlement, and drying shrinkage — and require full reapplication every three to seven years. Ceramic tile finishes, which appear more durable, fail at the grout joints, which absorb pool chemicals, degrade, and allow water ingress behind the tiles, causing progressive delamination that often goes undetected until large areas of tile are lifting from the shell.

Pool owners who have been through one or two liner replacement cycles understand the real economics: the material cost is not the principal expense. The disruption is. Emptying a 50,000-litre pool, waiting for the shell to dry, managing the construction phase, refilling, rebalancing the water chemistry, and being without the pool during the season it should be working — all of this is a cost that compounds with every replacement cycle.

Membriko exists to end that cycle. Based in Pombal, in central Portugal, Membriko installs EPDM rubber membrane — a single-material, chemical-resistant, permanently elastic waterproofing system — in pools of every type and scale, from compact residential plunge pools to large commercial hotel installations. An EPDM pool lining installed by Membriko comes with a 20-year installation warranty and a documented material service life in excess of 50 years. For most pools, it is the last lining they will ever need.

## Why EPDM Is the Ideal Pool Lining Membrane

A swimming pool subjects its lining to a combination of stresses that would defeat most materials within years. Any honest evaluation of pool lining options must start with understanding what the pool environment actually demands: permanent immersion in chemically dosed water; hydrostatic pressure from a water column that may be 1.8 metres deep; UV radiation at and above the waterline; temperature cycling from near-freezing in a winter-closed northern Portugal pool to 38°C or more in a solar-heated Algarve pool in August; and continuous structural micro-movement as the concrete shell expands and contracts with the seasons.

EPDM — Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer rubber — is the only lining material whose properties are intrinsically suited to all of these demands simultaneously. Understanding why requires a brief look at the chemistry.

### The Saturated Backbone: Why EPDM Does Not Degrade in Pool Water

EPDM's primary polymer chain consists exclusively of ethylene and propylene monomers, both of which are saturated hydrocarbons. A saturated polymer backbone contains no carbon-carbon double bonds. This is the single most important chemical fact about EPDM for pool applications.

Chlorine — the universal pool disinfectant — acts as an electrophilic oxidising agent. It attacks nucleophilic sites in organic molecules, and in polymer systems the primary targets are unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds. PVC requires plasticiser additives to be flexible; those plasticisers contain molecular structures susceptible to oxidative attack. Natural rubber, SBS-modified bituminous systems, and most thermoplastic elastomers contain backbone double bonds that chlorine and ozone attack directly. EPDM's backbone offers none of these targets. Its chemical resistance is not achieved through a protective coating or an additive that depletes over time — it is a permanent, intrinsic property of the polymer architecture.

A small quantity of a diene monomer — most commonly 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, known as ENB — is incorporated into the EPDM chain to provide cross-linking sites for vulcanisation during manufacturing. These ENB-derived double bonds are in side-chain positions, not the main chain, and are consumed during the vulcanisation process. Post-vulcanisation EPDM has negligible residual reactive sites. Independent ASTM D471 immersion testing on pool-grade EPDM — conducted at 200 ppm sodium hypochlorite solution at 70°C, conditions equivalent by Arrhenius projection to decades of residential pool service at 25°C — shows no measurable change in tensile strength, elongation at break, or hardness. This is not projected performance. It is measured performance under accelerated conditions.

### No Plasticisers: The Fundamental Difference from PVC

Plasticised PVC pool liners are formulated with 20 to 40 per cent by weight of plasticiser compounds — typically phthalates or adipates — to achieve the flexibility required for liner applications. These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to the PVC polymer; they are blended into the matrix and held by intermolecular forces alone. At pool water temperatures of 25 to 35°C, under UV radiation at the waterline, and in the presence of chlorine that directly oxidises plasticiser molecules, these compounds migrate progressively from the liner into the pool water.

Plasticiser loss is the degradation mechanism that makes PVC pool liners fail. A PVC liner that has lost 10 to 15 per cent of its plasticiser content becomes measurably stiffer and more brittle. At 20 per cent loss, cracking under mechanical stress — including the normal stress of water pressure against a liner folded around a step edge or corner — becomes probable. Field data from Southern European pool markets indicates that the majority of PVC liners in pools with significant sun exposure fail between 8 and 15 years for precisely this reason.

EPDM contains no plasticisers. Its flexibility is a fundamental property of the vulcanised rubber network — the three-dimensional cross-linked structure created during manufacturing — not an additive that will be lost. The membrane that Membriko installs today will be as flexible in 30 years as it is on the day of installation, because there is no depletion mechanism at work.

### Physical Performance Data

| Thickness — residential | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness — commercial / public | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |

| Projected service life | 50+ years | ERA / SKZ studies |

The 400 per cent elongation figure is worth pausing on. A membrane that can stretch to five times its original length before breaking is not merely puncture-resistant: it is structurally forgiving in a way that rigid systems cannot be. When the concrete shell beneath an EPDM pool lining develops a hairline crack — and all concrete cracks eventually — the membrane bridges that crack without transmitting the stress into a failure. The pool remains watertight. With epoxy paint or ceramic tile, the same crack propagates directly through the coating or grout joint and the pool leaks.

## Pool Types: Residential, Commercial and Natural Pools

EPDM is not a specialist material for one type of pool application. Membriko installs EPDM pool membrane across the full spectrum of pool types and scales found in Portugal, from a 20 m² plunge pool on a Lisbon terrace to a 400 m² hotel pool in the Algarve. The requirements differ — thickness, accessory specification, regulatory documentation — but the material and process discipline are consistent.

### Residential Pools

Portugal's 400,000-plus private residential pools represent the largest segment of the pool waterproofing market. The typical residential pool is 25 to 80 m², rectangular or L-shaped, built in reinforced concrete, and originally lined with PVC liner or ceramic tile. The majority of this stock is between 10 and 30 years old, which places a large proportion at or beyond the first liner replacement threshold.

For residential pools, Membriko installs 1.5 mm EPDM membrane. One of the most significant practical advantages for residential applications is the availability of EPDM in sheet widths up to 15.25 metres. Most residential pools in Portugal are narrower than 15 metres, which means the pool floor can be lined with a single, seamless EPDM panel — eliminating entirely the most vulnerable element of any liner system. No underwater seam means no underwater seam to fail. Wall panels are folded down from coping level, overlapping the floor panel, and seamed at the base of each wall using QuickSeam tape and primer.

Residential pool installations by Membriko are available in four colours — deep black, dark grey, blue-grey, and standard blue — each with distinct aesthetic and thermal characteristics described in detail in the design section below.

### Commercial and Hotel Pools

Portugal's commercial pool market — comprising hotels, resorts, leisure centres, health clubs, school facilities, and tourist apartments — numbers approximately 8,000 pools nationally. The Algarve hotel sector is the largest single concentration, with many 4- and 5-star properties operating multiple pools simultaneously, year-round or across an extended season from March to November.

Commercial pool operators face a different calculation from residential owners. A hotel pool that is out of service for liner replacement during peak season is not an inconvenience — it is a revenue event. Guests who book based on pool imagery and find it closed on arrival do not return. Review scores fall. For a property with a room rate that justifies the investment, a pool lining system that delivers 50-year service life is not a luxury specification; it is the economically rational choice.

Membriko installs 2.0 mm EPDM membrane in public and commercial pools, with ACS/WRAS water contact certification that satisfies the material hygiene requirements of Decreto-Lei 87/2024 — Portugal's public swimming pool legal framework — and NP EN 15288-1 (safety requirements for pool design). Membriko provides full certification documentation for every commercial project. The 20-year installation warranty that Membriko issues on commercial pool work aligns with the typical asset financing and depreciation cycles of hotel capital expenditure, eliminating the risk of a forced reinvestment during the loan amortisation period.

For large commercial installations, Membriko works with the client's technical team to develop an installation programme that minimises pool downtime — typically scheduling preparation, installation, and fill within a five to eight working day window for a standard 100 to 200 m² hotel pool.

### Natural and Biological Swimming Pools

Natural swimming pools — also known in Portugal as biopiscinas or piscinas biológicas — are growing rapidly as a category. In rural tourism, eco-lodges, boutique hotels with an environmental positioning, and private properties where the owners want to swim without chemical exposure, the natural pool has moved from a niche curiosity to a mainstream option.

A natural pool operates without synthetic chemical treatment. The swimming zone — concrete shell or membrane-lined, typically 1.2 to 2.0 metres deep — connects to a regeneration zone planted with aquatic macrophytes: reeds, marginal plants, and submerged oxygenators. Water circulates between the zones by a low-rate pump. The plants, their root substrate, and the microbial community that colonises that substrate absorb nutrients, filter suspended particles, and suppress algal growth through biological competition. No chlorine, bromine, or ozone enters the water.

For natural pools, EPDM is not merely the best material choice — it is the only technically appropriate one. The biological ecosystem of the regeneration zone is sensitive to any compound that migrates from the liner into the water. Plasticiser migration from PVC disrupts the microfauna of the biofilm; even at low concentrations, phthalate compounds are phytotoxic to some aquatic plant species. EPDM contains no plasticisers, no biocides, and no heavy metal compounds that could migrate into biologically active water. The water chemistry remains neutral to the ecosystem.

There is an additional technical requirement that makes EPDM uniquely appropriate: root resistance. The regeneration zone has aquatic plants whose roots grow against and around the lining membrane. Membriko uses EPDM that is tested for root resistance under the FLL methodology and EN 13948 — the same certification standard applied to EPDM root barrier membranes in extensive green roof systems. The membrane that can resist penetration by the aggressive root systems of a sedum green roof for 50 years is more than adequate for the roots of aquatic macrophytes.

## Chemical Resistance: EPDM and Pool Water Chemistry

The question Membriko hears most frequently in pool consultations is the most logical one: will the membrane withstand pool chemicals? The answer is not merely affirmative — it is supported by chemistry that no PVC liner manufacturer can replicate. Every form of pool water treatment used in Portugal is fully compatible with EPDM, and for different but equally well-understood chemical reasons.

### Sodium Hypochlorite and Calcium Hypochlorite

Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), dissolved in water to release hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite ions (ClO⁻), is the primary pool disinfectant used in Portugal — in both liquid form (bleach solution) for dosing systems and as calcium hypochlorite tablets for domestic pools. The free chlorine concentrations maintained in standard pool operation are 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L for residential pools; Decreto-Lei 87/2024 specifies 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L for public pools.

Shock treatment — super-chlorination at 10 to 20 mg/L, applied at pool opening in spring, after heavy bather load, or following algae outbreaks — subjects the lining to higher chlorine concentrations for short periods. ASTM D471 immersion testing of pool-grade EPDM in 200 ppm sodium hypochlorite solution at 70°C — a test condition equivalent by Arrhenius thermal acceleration to approximately 25 years of residential pool service at 25°C — shows no measurable change in tensile strength, hardness, or elongation at break. Shock chlorination at 10 to 20 mg/L falls well within EPDM's demonstrated chemical resistance range.

### Salt Chlorination

Salt-chlorinated pools — which use electrolytic cells to generate hypochlorous acid in situ from dissolved sodium chloride — have become increasingly popular in Portugal for both residential and hotel applications. They maintain lower free chlorine peak levels than direct sodium hypochlorite dosing, reduce chlorine odour and eye irritation, and eliminate the need to handle chlorine chemicals directly.

The salt concentration in a salt-chlorinated pool is typically 3.5 to 5.0 g/L — approximately one-seventh of seawater concentration. EPDM is used extensively in marine industrial environments, including dock fenders, splash zone protective systems, and coastal infrastructure, where contact with full-concentration seawater (35 g/L sodium chloride) at ambient temperature is continuous. Salt-chlorinated pool water presents no chemical challenge to EPDM at any concentration.

### Bromine Treatment

Bromine is used as an alternative to chlorine in some heated indoor pools, spas, and hydrotherapy pools, particularly because it remains active as a disinfectant at higher water temperatures and produces less volatile byproduct than chloramines. EPDM's chemical resistance to bromine is equivalent to its resistance to chlorine — the same saturated backbone argument applies. Membriko specifies standard pool-grade EPDM for bromine-treated pools without modification.

### Ozone and UV-C Sanitation

Ozone (O₃) and UV-C lamp systems are used in advanced pool water treatment, often in combination with a residual chlorine dose. Ozone is one of the most powerful oxidising agents in chemistry and is known to be aggressive towards elastomers that contain backbone double bonds — the reaction is called ozonolysis and involves the direct cleavage of those bonds. This is exactly the degradation mechanism that causes natural rubber and many thermoplastic elastomers to crack and crumble on outdoor exposure.

EPDM's saturated backbone has no double bonds available for ozonolysis. This is not a qualified resistance — it is the reason EPDM was originally developed for outdoor and industrial applications where contact with atmospheric ozone is permanent. EPDM roofing membranes have been continuously exposed to the ozone-containing atmosphere since the 1960s with no evidence of ozonolytic degradation. The trace ozone levels generated by pool ozone treatment systems present no risk to an EPDM pool lining.

### pH Range and Algaecide Compatibility

Standard pool water chemistry maintains pH between 7.2 and 7.8. EPDM is chemically stable across pH 4 to 12 — well outside the range of any pool water maintenance scenario, including the transient low-pH condition immediately after acid addition for pH correction. Quaternary ammonium compound algaecides, the most common algaecides used in Portuguese residential and commercial pools, are fully compatible with EPDM. Copper sulphate, used as an alternative algaecide, does not chemically affect EPDM but can leave blue-green staining on light-coloured membranes — a cosmetic issue with no structural significance, and not relevant to Membriko's black and dark grey membranes.

## Membriko's Pool Installation Process

Pool waterproofing is not a materials problem. Any competent installation company can source pool-grade EPDM membrane. The variable — the factor that determines whether an EPDM lining lasts 50 years or fails prematurely — is process discipline during installation. Every step in Membriko's installation sequence exists because skipping it, or performing it carelessly, has a documented failure mode. This is not a checklist of routine tasks. It is an engineering process.

### Step 1: Technical Site Survey

Before any quotation is prepared, Membriko conducts a free technical survey of the pool. This visit is not a sales exercise — it is a structured engineering assessment that includes:

Precise measurement of the pool shell: overall length and width at every point, depth profile across the floor, step dimensions, internal corner geometry, and the position and dimensions of every penetration (skimmers, return inlets, floor drains, light fittings, vacuum points, overflow channels, heat exchanger connections). A pool that is 12 metres long on one wall and 11.8 metres on the opposite wall — a common reality in older hand-built concrete shells — requires an accurate cut plan, not a nominal dimension.

Structural assessment: visual inspection for cracking, surface scaling, areas of active ingress, exposed reinforcement, delaminated render, or previous repair attempts. Photographs are taken systematically. The survey identifies whether crack injection (for active structural cracks), surface grinding (for sharp projections), mortar filling (for depressions or missing material), or complete surface smoothing (for rough or porous concrete) is required before membrane installation.

Existing lining assessment: where an existing PVC liner or tile finish is in place, Membriko assesses adhesion quality using percussion testing (for tiles) or pull-off testing (for adhered liners) and identifies areas where the existing lining must be removed before the EPDM is applied.

Equipment assessment: filtration flow rate, treatment type, skimmer positions, and return inlet sizes are recorded to ensure that the EPDM penetration accessories ordered are matched to the existing or planned hydraulic equipment.

### Step 2: Cut Plan and Specification

The survey data is used to prepare a precise membrane cut plan — the layout that determines how the EPDM panels are sized and positioned to cover the pool floor and walls with the minimum number of seams. For a rectangular pool less than 15 metres wide, a single floor panel is typically achievable, eliminating all submerged seams. Complex pool geometries — L-shapes, pools with integrated spas or beach entry zones, natural pools with irregular perimeters — require more sophisticated cut planning, but the principle remains: every seam eliminated is a risk eliminated.

The specification document confirms membrane thickness (1.5 mm residential, 2.0 mm commercial), colour selection, certification level (ACS/WRAS documentation for public pools), and the complete accessory schedule: skimmer interface flanges, return inlet sleeves, floor drain assemblies, light fitting gaskets, overflow channel membraning, and perimeter termination bar profile and fixing centres.

### Step 3: Pool Emptying and Structural Preparation

The structural preparation phase is the most undervalued part of pool waterproofing. Contractors who rush preparation to save time create the conditions for premature adhesion failure, membrane bridging, and early lining failure.

Membriko begins with complete pool emptying and drying — a minimum of 48 hours for normal conditions, longer for pools with a history of significant water ingress or thick concrete walls that retain moisture. Old concrete shells in the Alentejo, where walls may be 250 to 300 mm thick and have been wet for 20 years, may require 96 hours or more of drying before membrane adhesive can be applied to a surface with acceptable moisture content.

Once dry, high-pressure water jetting removes biofilm, calcium carbonate scaling, algae residue, and any loose surface material. Structural cracks are filled with flexible epoxy or polyurethane injection mortar — the goal is to eliminate pathways for ground water ingress under the membrane and to remove any sharp crack lips that could concentrate stress on the membrane under hydrostatic pressure. Sharp corner edges, projecting tie bolt stubs, gravel particles embedded in the concrete face, and any protrusion greater than 3 mm that could create a point load through the membrane are ground flush.

Surface planarity is checked with a 2-metre straightedge. Depressions greater than 5 mm in any 2-metre run are levelled with cementitious smoothing mortar. The finished surface must be capable of providing intimate contact with the membrane so that the adhesive bond is uniform — not spotty and hollow.

### Step 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Membrane installation begins with the floor panel, which is the largest single piece and must be positioned correctly before any wall work begins. The EPDM is unrolled into the empty pool, oriented according to the cut plan, and bonded to the concrete using immersion-rated contact adhesive — a system certified for continuous immersion in chemically treated water at pH 6.5 to 8.5 and temperatures up to 50°C.

Full-surface adhesion (the fully adhered method) is Membriko's standard approach for pool applications. Adhesive is applied to both the membrane underside and the concrete substrate surface, allowed to reach the correct tack level — a controlled open time that varies with temperature and humidity — and the membrane is then pressed firmly onto the substrate, working outward from the centre to avoid air entrapment beneath the sheet. A rubber roller is used to consolidate the bond across every square centimetre.

Wall panels are installed after the floor is bonded, lapping 100 mm over the floor panel edges. Internal corners receive pre-formed EPDM corner pieces that create a smooth, tension-free transition at 90-degree junctions — these pre-formed details are critical, because field-folded membrane at internal corners is under permanent tensile stress that accelerates fatigue and seam failure at those points. Step edges are each treated individually, with seam positions placed on horizontal faces rather than on the exposed edges where mechanical stress is greatest.

### Step 5: Seams and Penetration Details

Every membrane-to-membrane seam is made using QuickPrime Plus primer and QuickSeam splicing tape — a 150 mm wide butyl-based adhesive tape designed specifically for EPDM seaming. The process: the mating surfaces are cleaned with the appropriate solvent, QuickPrime Plus is applied to both faces and allowed to become tacky, the QuickSeam tape is positioned centrally over the seam, and firm pressure is applied using a silicone roller, working from the centre outward to expel any air pockets.

Every finished seam is tested before the pool is filled. A flat metal probe is pressed along the seam edge at consistent pressure. Where the bond is complete, the probe deflects off a solid surface. Where a void exists, the probe penetrates — and that section is remade before testing again.

Penetrations for skimmers, return inlets, floor drains, underwater light fittings, and vacuum points are sealed using EPDM-bodied accessories: bolted compression ring assemblies that clamp the EPDM membrane between the flange body and a matching counter-flange, creating a mechanical and chemical seal that does not rely on sealant compounds. Membriko uses no silicone or polysulphide sealant as a primary penetration seal. Sealants are maintenance items. Mechanical EPDM flanges, installed correctly, are permanent.

### Step 6: Perimeter Termination

At the pool coping level, the EPDM membrane is dressed over the pool wall and terminated using an anodised aluminium or stainless steel termination bar, mechanically fixed to the concrete or masonry coping at 300 mm centres using stainless steel expanding anchors. The termination bar covers the raw membrane edge, provides mechanical restraint against the upward pull of the water-loaded membrane, and creates a clean visual transition between the lining and the pool deck or coping stone finish.

The termination bar is installed before any coping stonework, tiling, or deck paving is laid in the area immediately adjacent to the pool — Membriko coordinates the installation sequence with other trades to ensure the membrane termination is protected before foot traffic and abrasive materials are introduced.

### Step 7: Leak Testing and Inspection

After installation is complete and before the pool is handed over, Membriko conducts a structured inspection and leak test. The visual inspection covers every linear metre of seam, every penetration detail, and the full perimeter termination, with photographs at all critical points. Any seam section that does not pass the probe test is remade.

The pool is then filled gradually. Rapid filling should be avoided — the progressive increase in hydrostatic pressure as the water level rises should be controlled to allow the adhesive bond to load gradually and to confirm that no area of the membrane is lifting under pressure. Membriko monitors the fill rate and inspects the pool walls during filling.

Water level is recorded at the point of full fill and monitored for 72 hours. Any drop in level exceeding 5 mm per day — adjusted for evaporation and air temperature — triggers a leak investigation. Where a leak is suspected but not immediately visible, Membriko applies Electronic Leak Detection (ELD): an electrical current is passed between the pool water and a reference electrode outside the pool, and a probe scanned over the wet membrane identifies any breach by detecting the current flow path. ELD can locate a pinhole leak in a 400 m² pool to within a few centimetres.

### Step 8: Warranty and Handover

At project completion, Membriko issues the 20-year installation warranty certificate, the as-built photographic record, the quality inspection report, and the EPDM pool membrane maintenance guide. An optional 12-month follow-up inspection is offered to all clients, at which point the waterline zone — the highest UV-exposure area of the lining — and all penetration details are re-examined and documented.

## Renovation of Existing Pools with EPDM

The renovation market for Portuguese swimming pools is larger than the new-build market. Most of the 400,000 private pools were constructed in the 1990s and early 2000s, placing a large proportion of that stock at or beyond the first or second major waterproofing intervention. The conventional renovation options — complete ceramic demolition and retiling, or PVC liner replacement — are expensive, disruptive, and, in the case of PVC, simply defer the next replacement by another decade.

EPDM renovation is the third option, and for most pools it is the most cost-effective and permanent solution available.

### What Membriko Can Install EPDM Over

**Existing PVC liner:** provided the PVC is well-adhered to the concrete shell — no large bubbles, no widespread delamination — Membriko can install EPDM directly over the existing liner. The PVC acts as a smooth, level substrate. This approach eliminates the labour cost of PVC removal, reduces the renovation timeline, and adds only 1.5 to 2.0 mm to the internal pool dimension, which has no practical effect on pool volume or function.

**Ceramic tiles and mosaics:** if tiles are well-adhered — percussion testing (tapping with a rubber-headed hammer and listening for the hollow sound that indicates a void beneath) identifies compromised areas — Membriko can install EPDM over existing tile. Grout joints with pronounced relief (greater than 2 to 3 mm above the tile face) are filled with smoothing mortar before membrane installation to prevent point loading through the membrane at grout lines. This approach saves the substantial cost and disruption of ceramic demolition.

**Concrete shell:** direct installation over the concrete shell after preparation is the standard approach for pools that have lost their original lining, were left unlined, or where the existing coating has been mechanically removed. Concrete is the ideal EPDM substrate — it provides structural support, accepts the contact adhesive reliably when properly prepared, and does not introduce compatibility risks.

**Epoxy paint:** if the existing epoxy coating is adhered firmly and in good condition, Membriko can apply EPDM over it after light mechanical abrading to provide surface keying. If the epoxy is delaminating or was applied over a contaminated surface, it must be removed mechanically.

### What Must Be Addressed Before Renovation

Active structural cracks — cracks through which water is actively flowing or seeping — must be injected with hydro-expanding polyurethane before the membrane is installed. The membrane will bridge closed or stable cracks without consequence; it cannot resist the hydraulic pressure from an active ground water pathway trying to push water into the pool from outside.

Tiles with widespread hollow sections — where more than 30 to 40 per cent of the surface is debonded — should be fully removed. Installing membrane over large unsupported tile sections creates a risk of tile collapse under subsequent thermal and hydrostatic loading, which would distort the membrane above.

Surfaces with active biological contamination — algae, biofilm, or mould growth that has penetrated the substrate — require sodium hypochlorite treatment and full drying before membrane installation. Encapsulating active biological material beneath a membrane is not a solution: it continues to grow and, in severe cases, can generate gases that pressurise the membrane-substrate interface.

Membriko identifies all of these conditions during the technical survey and presents the client with a clear scope of preparatory works required before installation. There are no surprises in a Membriko renovation.

## Natural and Biological Swimming Pools

The natural swimming pool movement in Portugal is concentrated in regions with the strongest rural tourism sector and the strongest environmental design culture: the Alentejo interior, Beira Interior, Minho, and the increasingly eco-positioned tourism corridor of the Douro. Boutique hotels and rural tourism properties in these areas are increasingly specifying natural pools as a differentiator in a market where the standard hotel pool is ubiquitous.

The defining characteristic of a natural pool is the absence of synthetic chemical treatment. Filtration is biological, performed by the planted regeneration zone. The lining membrane, as a result, faces requirements that are fundamentally different from those of a chemically treated pool — and the requirements are in several respects more demanding.

### The Two-Zone System and Its Membrane Requirements

A natural pool comprises a swimming zone, typically 1.2 to 2.0 metres deep, separated from a regeneration zone 0.3 to 0.6 metres deep by a physical divider (underwater wall or ridge). The regeneration zone is planted on a gravel or zeolite substrate with aquatic macrophytes: emergent plants (reeds, rushes, sedges), floating-leaved species (water lilies), and submerged oxygenators (hornwort, water starwort). Water circulates from the swimming zone through the regeneration zone and back by a low-volume recirculation pump.

The membrane must line both zones and the dividing structure. In the regeneration zone, the membrane sits at 0.3 to 0.6 metres depth with near-direct UV exposure through the shallow water column and with plant roots growing against and around it. In the swimming zone, conditions are similar to a conventional pool minus the chemical treatment. At the divider, the membrane must accommodate the transition detail cleanly.

### Why EPDM Is the Only Correct Choice

**Chemical neutrality.** The biological filtration ecosystem of a natural pool is sensitive to trace organic compounds that migrate from synthetic polymer liners into the water. Plasticisers from PVC liners — even at sub-threshold concentrations — can disrupt the microbial communities and microfauna that are responsible for nutrient uptake and particulate filtration in the regeneration zone. Some aquatic plant species show documented phytotoxic responses to phthalate-class plasticisers. EPDM contains no plasticisers, no biocides, no heavy metals, and no processing aids that would migrate into biologically active water. The water in a natural pool lined with Membriko EPDM is chemically identical, from the pool lining's perspective, to rainwater.

**Root resistance.** The aquatic macrophytes planted in the regeneration zone are not delicate species. Reeds, phragmites, and vigorous marginal plants develop extensive, sometimes aggressive root systems. The membrane in the regeneration zone will be in contact with growing root material for the entire service life of the pool. Membriko uses EPDM that carries root resistance certification under the FLL methodology (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau, the German landscape research organisation that developed the standard test for root resistance) and EN 13948. This is the same certification that qualifies EPDM as a root barrier membrane in extensive green roof systems, where it must resist penetration by the root systems of sedum, grasses, and mosses for decades. The root resistance is not a coating — it is an intrinsic property of the vulcanised EPDM compound.

**UV stability in the shallow zone.** At 0.3 to 0.5 metres depth, the attenuation of UV-B radiation through the water column is modest — approximately 60 to 70 per cent of surface UV-B intensity reaches the membrane in the regeneration zone on a clear day. This is the highest UV-exposure position of any pool membrane application. EPDM's saturated backbone and high carbon black loading (approximately 40 parts per hundred rubber, the primary UV absorber) provide intrinsic UV stability that does not depend on depleting surface additives. Published accelerated weathering data (EN ISO 4892-3, xenon arc, 2,000 hours) shows no surface cracking, chalking, or meaningful mechanical property change in pool-grade EPDM, equivalent to several decades of Portuguese UV exposure even at the intensity of the shallow regeneration zone.

**Geometric flexibility.** Natural pools are rarely rectangular. The design ethic of natural pool projects typically seeks integration with the landscape — irregular perimeters, curved banks, beach entries, shallow wading areas, integrated planting bays. EPDM's availability in widths up to 15.25 metres and its 400-plus per cent elongation make it the only sheet membrane that can accommodate complex free-form geometry without creating excessive seam lines or forcing the geometry to conform to the material's limitations.

## EPDM vs Alternatives: PVC Liner, Fibreglass, Concrete Coatings, Polyurea

Membriko presents this comparison with the same directness we use in client consultations: every material has contexts where it is a reasonable choice. The purpose here is not to disparage alternatives but to provide the technical data from which an informed decision can be made.

**PVC liner.** The cost advantage of PVC liner at installation is real but misleading. A pool lined with PVC at €15 to €20 per square metre will require replacement at €12 to €18 per square metre every 8 to 15 years — two or three replacement cycles within the 30-year period during which EPDM requires no intervention. The 30-year total cost of the PVC option, including disruption costs and the increasing difficulty of sourcing matching PVC liner colours as product lines change, substantially exceeds the initial cost of EPDM.

**Fibreglass.** Pre-formed fibreglass shells are a legitimate option for new above-ground pools where a concrete shell has not yet been built. For existing concrete pools, fibreglass overlay requires either a new free-standing fibreglass shell (a major structural alteration) or hand-laminating GRP in situ (with significant quality variability). Pre-formed shells are constrained by transport size — typically 10 by 4 metres maximum — and are not suitable for pools larger than that. Osmotic blistering of the gel coat, caused by water penetration through microscopic gel coat porosity, is the dominant long-term failure mode and typically manifests from year 8 onward.

**Epoxy paint and polyurethane coatings.** These are liquid-applied systems that cure to a rigid film. The critical limitation is elongation: epoxy pool paints achieve 0 to 5 per cent elongation, meaning any substrate crack propagates directly through the coating. Recoating is required every three to seven years as the film oxidises and loses adhesion. For pools on active ground or in areas with seasonal water table variation — which describes much of the Alentejo and coastal Portugal — epoxy paint is structurally unsuitable as a permanent waterproofing solution.

**Polyurea.** Spray-applied polyurea coatings achieve better elongation than epoxy (50 to 200 per cent depending on formulation) and are genuinely durable. The limitations are cost (polyurea application requires specialised heated equipment and skilled operators), the requirement for exceptional surface preparation (moisture sensitivity is high), and the absence of the 50-year independent performance data that exists for EPDM. Polyurea is a competitive option for specific pool applications; Membriko does not install it, and cannot offer the 50-year performance documentation for it that exists for EPDM.

**Ceramic tile and mosaic.** The Portuguese mosaic tile finish — hydraulic tile, hand-painted azulejo, glass mosaic — represents an aesthetic quality that EPDM cannot replicate. For clients where the visual finish is the primary specification driver and budget is not a constraint, tile is a legitimate choice. Grout joints degrade under pool chemistry over 15 to 25 years and require periodic regrouting; structural movement causes tile delamination that requires patch repairs. Membriko is direct with clients who prioritise aesthetics: if the appearance of Portuguese ceramic is the goal, EPDM is not the right answer. If 50-year durability, chemical neutrality, and minimum lifecycle cost are the goals, EPDM is.

## Thermal Benefits: EPDM's Role in Pool Heat Retention

The thermal properties of EPDM pool membrane are commercially significant in the Portuguese context, where the economics of pool heating — and the desire to extend the swimming season beyond the peak summer months — are relevant for both residential and hotel pools.

### Passive Solar Heating by Black EPDM

Carbon-black-filled EPDM has a solar absorptivity of approximately 0.93, meaning it absorbs 93 per cent of incident solar radiation. In an unshaded outdoor pool, the dark membrane acts as a passive solar collector. The energy absorbed at the pool floor and walls heats the water immediately adjacent to the membrane surface and is distributed through the water column by convection.

Under peak solar irradiance conditions in southern Portugal — a clear summer day in the Alentejo or Algarve with global horizontal irradiance above 700 W/m² — the passive heating contribution of a black EPDM pool floor is measurable. Compared to an equivalent pool lined with a pale-coloured material (reflectivity ≈ 0.60 to 0.70), black EPDM generates a water temperature differential of 2 to 5°C under maximum solar exposure. For pools in the Algarve that are already warm enough in July and August, this differential may be irrelevant or occasionally unwelcome; for pools in northern and central Portugal that struggle to reach comfortable swimming temperature in May and September, a 2 to 5°C passive gain can meaningfully extend the season.

### Colour Options and Thermal Performance

| Membrane Colour | Solar Absorptivity | Water Temperature Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Deep black (standard) | ~0.93 | Maximum passive gain (+2 to 5°C vs pale liner) |
| Dark grey / anthracite | ~0.80 | High passive gain (+1 to 3°C) |
| Blue-grey | ~0.60 | Moderate passive gain (+0.5 to 2°C) |
| Standard blue | ~0.50 | Low to moderate passive gain |

There is no white EPDM pool membrane commercially available, because the carbon black that provides UV protection is also the source of the dark colour. Light-coloured EPDM formulations without carbon black loading have significantly reduced UV resistance and are not suitable for pool applications.

### Compatibility with Pool Heating Systems

EPDM's service temperature range — continuous immersion up to 50°C, dry surface up to 130°C — is far above the operating temperatures of every pool heating technology used in Portugal:

**Solar thermal panels** circulate water through roof-mounted collectors. Even in Portuguese summer conditions, the return temperature to the pool from a solar circuit rarely exceeds 45 to 55°C. EPDM is fully compatible.

**Heat pump systems** typically deliver water to the pool at 28 to 35°C. At these temperatures, EPDM is operating well within its normal range.

**Gas-fired heat exchangers** operate on similar return temperature profiles to heat pumps. Fully compatible.

**Geothermal heat exchange** delivers stable return temperatures of 22 to 28°C regardless of season. The most thermally benign heating option and entirely compatible with EPDM.

### Thermal Insulation Upgrade Option

For heated pools in northern and central Portugal where wall and floor heat losses represent a significant fraction of annual heating energy consumption, Membriko can incorporate a thermal insulation layer between the concrete shell and the EPDM membrane during the installation or renovation process. A 40 to 60 mm layer of closed-cell spray polyurethane (SPU) or extruded polystyrene board (XPS) applied to the concrete shell before membrane installation can reduce heat loss through the pool envelope by up to 40 per cent — a measurable reduction in annual heating costs for pools that operate year-round or across an extended heated season.

**On certifications:** The ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire), issued by accredited French laboratories under the Ministère de la Santé, tests for migration of specific compounds — including sulphur-based vulcanisation residues, zinc from ZnO activator, antioxidants, and carbon black extractables — into water in contact with the membrane. ACS-certified EPDM has demonstrated migration levels below the limits set in the French Arrêté du 29 mai 1997, which governs materials in fixed water production, treatment, and distribution systems. The WRAS approval (Water Regulations Advisory Scheme, United Kingdom) applies the BS 6920 test protocol, evaluating odour, taste, appearance change, and metal and organic compound extraction. Both certifications are applicable to pool water contact under Decreto-Lei 87/2024.

## Maintenance of EPDM Pool Linings

One of the most significant practical advantages of EPDM as a pool lining material is the near-total absence of membrane-specific maintenance requirements. Unlike PVC liners — which require careful management of pool chemistry to avoid accelerating plasticiser loss, and which should not be cleaned with acid-based products — and unlike epoxy coatings — which require periodic reapplication as a planned maintenance item — EPDM's chemical stability means the membrane requires no specific maintenance protocol beyond the normal management of pool water quality.

### Routine Pool Season Maintenance

Maintain pool water chemistry within standard parameters: free chlorine 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L, pH 7.2 to 7.8, and total alkalinity 80 to 120 mg/L as CaCO₃. There is no chlorine concentration within the normal management range of a domestic or commercial pool that is harmful to EPDM. Pool water chemistry is maintained for bather health and comfort — not for the protection of the membrane.

Brush the pool walls and floor with nylon or polypropylene pool brushes. Automatic pool cleaning robots fitted with rubber brush heads and plastic brush heads are safe for EPDM. Avoid robots equipped with metal-bristled brushes or aggressive abrasive pads that could mark the membrane surface. High-pressure water jetting at up to 150 bar is safe for EPDM and is effective for removal of calcium scaling at the waterline.

### Seasonal Inspection

At each pool season opening — and especially in pools that are closed and partially or fully drained over winter — Membriko recommends a visual inspection of three zones. First: the waterline band, from 30 cm above to 30 cm below the normal operating water level. This zone experiences the highest UV exposure, the greatest number of wet-dry cycles, and the most mechanical contact with pool cleaning equipment and bather activity. Second: every skimmer, return inlet, floor drain, and light fitting penetration. The interface between the membrane and the penetration accessory should be examined for any sign of separation, lifting, or distortion. Third: the perimeter termination bar at coping level. Any section where the termination bar has moved or where the membrane edge is exposed should be reported to Membriko for assessment.

### Repair Procedures

EPDM pool membranes can be damaged mechanically — a dropped tile tool, a sharp-edged cleaning appliance, a stainless-steel floor drain grate corner left unsupported during a heavy renovation. Mechanical puncture is the only realistic damage mechanism for an EPDM pool membrane in normal service, and it is entirely repairable.

For urgent situations where pool closure is not immediately possible: Membriko can apply an emergency underwater repair using a specialised EPDM underwater adhesive system that cures in direct contact with pool water. This is a temporary repair — it will hold for weeks to months under normal pool conditions — intended to defer pool emptying until a convenient opportunity.

For permanent repair, the pool is emptied and the affected area dried thoroughly. A patch of EPDM membrane, cut to overlap the damaged area by a minimum of 75 mm on all sides, is bonded with QuickPrime and QuickSeam tape using the same process as the original seam. For a single puncture in an otherwise sound membrane, the total repair time from pool emptying to complete cure is typically two to four hours, with pool refilling requiring a further 12 to 24 hours for a standard residential pool.

### What to Avoid

Sharp objects — tile nibblers, chisel points, angle grinder discs — operated near the pool membrane. Any point load applied to the membrane at a small contact area can punch through 1.5 mm EPDM if sufficient force is applied.

Shock chlorination directly onto the dry or barely-submerged membrane surface. Best practice for super-chlorination: pre-dissolve the shock dose in a bucket of pool water before adding to the pool. This is good practice for any pool surface, not specifically an EPDM precaution.

Open-flame operations adjacent to the membrane — soldering, gas welding, or any torch application. EPDM is not a fire hazard under normal pool conditions, but sustained direct flame will damage it.

## Portuguese Pool Regulations and Safety Standards

### Decreto-Lei 87/2024: Public Swimming Pool Legal Framework

Decreto-Lei 87/2024, which entered into force in 2024, established the updated legal framework for piscinas de uso público — public swimming pools — in Portugal, replacing the earlier Decreto Regulamentar 5/97. Public swimming pools are defined broadly to include hotel, resort, and tourist apartment pools; leisure centre and sports club pools; school, hospital, and therapeutic pools; and any installation accessible to the public with or without payment.

The requirements relevant to pool waterproofing and lining materials include:

Materials in contact with pool water must be smooth, non-porous, and capable of being cleaned and disinfected. This requirement effectively excludes porous surfaces and materials that cannot withstand the cleaning agents used in commercial pool maintenance. EPDM is smooth, non-porous, and resistant to all standard pool cleaning and disinfection products.

Water quality parameters that the pool operator must maintain include free chlorine between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/L, pH between 7.2 and 7.6, turbidity below 0.5 NTU, and microbiological parameters specified in Anexo I of the decreto. These parameters are maintained through water treatment — the liner material plays no role in achieving them, but a liner that compromises water quality through compound migration would be non-compliant.

Membriko provides ACS and WRAS certification documentation for every commercial and public pool project, demonstrating that the membrane material satisfies the material hygiene requirements of the decreto. This documentation is filed with the pool technical dossier required under Artigo 8 of the decreto.

ASAE (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica) is the enforcement authority responsible for inspecting public pool water quality compliance. A certified EPDM lining with documented ACS/WRAS approval constitutes demonstrable due diligence on the material hygiene question.

### NP EN 15288-1 and NP EN 15288-2

The European standards NP EN 15288-1 (Swimming pools — safety requirements for design) and NP EN 15288-2 (Swimming pools — safety requirements for operation) apply to public pools in Portugal. From a waterproofing perspective, the relevant requirements are that the pool shell must be watertight, that penetrations for skimmers and drains must be sealed by approved methods, and that the pool interior surface must not present sharp edges, projections, or deformable surfaces that constitute a safety risk to swimmers.

EPDM installed by Membriko — with mechanically sealed penetration accessories and smooth, non-projecting membrane surface — satisfies all of these structural and safety requirements. Membriko's standard installation specification is designed with compliance to these standards in mind.

### Private Residential Pools: Regulatory Position

Private residential pools in Portugal are not subject to Decreto-Lei 87/2024 or NP EN 15288. Their construction or renovation requires a licença de construção or comunicação prévia from the local Câmara Municipal, depending on the pool dimensions and the municipal regulations of the jurisdiction. There is no national requirement specifying a particular lining material for private pools.

Membriko recommends ACS or WRAS-certified EPDM for private residential pools as a matter of professional practice and client health assurance, not regulatory obligation. The certifications guarantee that no compounds migrate from the membrane into the pool water above defined safety thresholds — a health assurance that Membriko considers non-negotiable regardless of whether it is legally required.

### Environmental Licensing Considerations

Pools located near or within protected natural areas — Reserva Ecológica Nacional coastal zones, Reserva Agrícola Nacional classified land, Natura 2000 network sites, or the margins of watercourses — may require specific environmental impact assessment or environmental licensing from the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA). In these contexts, the absence of plasticiser or chemical compound migration from EPDM into ground or surface water is an advantage that can be documented with ACS/WRAS certification in the environmental licence application dossier.

## Design Flexibility: Colours, Shapes and Custom Pools

The perception that EPDM pool membrane produces an "industrial" or unfinished appearance is understandable but outdated. The contemporary design tradition for high-specification residential and boutique hotel pools — particularly in Portugal's strongest architectural markets of Alentejo, Comporta, and the Douro — has embraced deep-black pool linings precisely because of their visual elegance. A black or dark-grey pool does not look industrial. It looks like a mirror of the sky.

### Colour Palette

**Deep black.** The default specification for Membriko pool installations and the colour that best represents the current design direction in high-specification Portuguese pool design. A black EPDM pool creates a water surface that reflects the surrounding landscape — olive trees in the Alentejo, whitewashed walls in the Algarve, granite outcrops in the Douro. The pool disappears into the landscape rather than competing with it. Black also provides maximum passive solar heating — approximately 93 per cent solar absorptivity — which is an advantage in the shoulder seasons in northern and central Portugal.

**Dark grey / anthracite.** A neutral choice suited to contemporary architecture in exposed concrete, weathered steel, or natural stone. Dark grey reduces passive solar absorption slightly compared to black while retaining most of the visual depth.

**Blue-grey.** A transitional colour between the contemporary dark palette and the traditional pool-blue aesthetic. Blue-grey reads as natural stone — slate, schist, or dark limestone — and integrates particularly well with pools in rural quinta settings or in coastal properties where the palette of natural materials is the architectural reference. Passive solar absorption is moderate.

**Standard blue.** The colour closest to the conventional pool appearance that most people recognise from decades of PVC liner in residential pools. For clients whose pool should look like a pool — recognisably blue, familiar, comfortable — standard blue EPDM provides the durability of EPDM with the aesthetic of a conventional liner.

### Geometric Flexibility

EPDM's availability in sheets up to 15.25 metres wide and its 400-plus per cent elongation make it the most geometrically accommodating pool lining system available. Rectangular pools up to 15 metres wide can be lined without any submerged seam on the floor. Larger pools and non-rectangular geometries require seaming, but Membriko's cut planning minimises seam length while respecting the geometry the design requires.

**Infinity edge and overflow pools.** Membriko lines both the main pool basin and the overflow collection channel with EPDM, creating a continuous membrane system with no material change at the spillway edge. The overflow channel — which is often the most challenging waterproofing detail in infinity pool construction — is lined with EPDM using the same accessory and seaming standards as the main pool.

**Beach entry and gradual-slope designs.** EPDM's flexibility allows it to be installed over any gradient without buckling or wrinkling. Beach entry slopes, from 0 to 600 mm depth over a 2 to 3 metre run, are lined with the membrane dressed smoothly over the substrate and anchored at the coping level at the top of the slope.

**Free-form geometry — kidney, L, circular, organic.** Natural pool designs, landscape-integrated pools with curved perimeters, and pools with irregular floor profiles are all accommodated without compromise. The cut plan takes longer to develop; the installation takes longer to execute at the transition points; but the finished result is a continuously sealed, seam-minimised membrane that conforms precisely to the geometry specified by the architect or landscape designer.

**Raised and above-ground structures.** Timber-frame raised pools, steel-sided above-ground pools, and concrete plunge pools on terraces or roof decks are all suitable substrates for EPDM lining. The membrane is attached at the top of the structure using a perimeter clamping profile and hangs in tension as the pool fills — the water pressure holds the membrane against the structure walls. This approach eliminates the need for a perfectly smooth interior substrate, making EPDM the ideal lining for pools built in timber or steel.

**Hybrid EPDM and tile finishes.** Some clients choose EPDM for the pool floor and walls — where durability, chemical resistance, and long-term performance are the priority — with a decorative tile or mosaic band in the waterline zone (30 to 60 cm above and below the waterline) where the aesthetic of Portuguese ceramic is desired. Membriko has detailed experience with the transition junction between EPDM membrane and tile finish at the waterline, ensuring that the seam is watertight and that differential movement between the two materials is accommodated.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can EPDM membrane be installed over an existing pool with old ceramic tiles?**

In the majority of cases, yes. The condition is that the tiles are well-adhered to the concrete shell. Membriko tests tile adhesion using percussion testing — tapping systematically with a rubber-headed hammer and listening for the hollow sound that indicates debonded tiles beneath the surface. Areas with debonded tiles must be removed, and the surface filled and levelled before membrane installation. Where grout joints project more than 2 to 3 mm above the tile face, they are filled with smoothing mortar. The EPDM is then installed over the prepared tile surface as it would be over concrete. This renovation approach avoids the cost and disruption of complete tile demolition and is Membriko's most common renovation scenario.

**Will black EPDM make my pool uncomfortably hot in a Portuguese summer?**

This is a legitimate design question. Black EPDM absorbs approximately 93 per cent of solar radiation and can increase passive water temperature by 2 to 5°C compared to a pale-coloured liner under maximum solar conditions. In the Algarve in July and August, where air temperatures reach 35 to 40°C, this passive gain may bring an unheated pool to 30 to 32°C — which some users find comfortable and others do not. Clients for whom pool water temperature in peak summer is a concern should discuss this with Membriko during the survey. Blue-grey or standard blue membrane reduces passive solar absorption significantly and is a genuine solution to this concern. Alternatively, a pool cover during peak daytime hours is effective at moderating temperature regardless of liner colour.

**Is EPDM suitable for free-form shaped pools — kidney, circular, L-shaped?**

Yes, and in some respects EPDM is better suited to free-form geometry than alternatives. Sheet widths up to 15.25 metres and elongation above 400 per cent allow the membrane to conform to any geometry without wrinkle stress concentrations. Membriko's cut planning for free-form pools is more complex than for rectangles, but the result is a membrane system with minimal seam lines that follows the pool geometry precisely. Natural pool designs, which are almost never rectangular, represent a significant portion of Membriko's pool portfolio.

**Is EPDM safe for natural swimming pools with no chemical treatment?**

EPDM is the correct and Membriko's only recommendation for natural pool applications. It contains no plasticisers, biocides, or heavy metals that migrate into biologically active water. It carries root resistance certification under FLL methodology and EN 13948, relevant for the regeneration zone where aquatic plant roots grow against the membrane. Its UV stability under near-direct UV exposure in the shallow regeneration zone is documented to 2,000 hours of accelerated testing without surface degradation. For natural pools, using any material other than EPDM — or a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liner without plasticisers — is a risk that Membriko would not accept on behalf of a client.

**What warranty does Membriko provide for pool waterproofing?**

Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty for all EPDM pool lining work. This is supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product warranty (typically 20 years for pool-grade EPDM from European manufacturers) and to the five-year statutory defects liability period under Article 1225 of the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil). The warranty certificate, the as-built photographic record, and the quality inspection report are delivered to the client at project handover. The warranty covers defects in installation workmanship; it does not cover mechanical damage caused by third-party activities or pool equipment not covered in the installation scope.

**Can shock chlorination at high concentrations damage the EPDM membrane?**

No. Super-chlorination at 10 to 20 mg/L free chlorine is fully within the documented chemical resistance range of pool-grade EPDM, as established by ASTM D471 testing at far higher concentrations than any pool shock treatment would achieve. Best practice for shock treatment — relevant for any pool surface, not specifically EPDM — is to pre-dissolve the shock dose in a bucket of pool water before adding to the pool, to avoid localised high-concentration contact with the pool surface or accessories at the point of addition.

**Is pool EPDM the same material as EPDM used for roofing?**

The base polymer chemistry is identical — ethylene propylene diene monomer, vulcanised with sulphur cure system, carbon-black reinforced. The differences are in the formulation and certification profile. Pool-grade EPDM is formulated with an antioxidant package optimised for aqueous immersion service rather than atmospheric exposure; it is manufactured to 1.5 or 2.0 mm thickness for pool applications (versus 1.0 to 1.2 mm for many roofing applications); and it is tested and certified to ACS and WRAS standards for water contact compliance. Membriko specifies pool-certified EPDM exclusively for all applications where the membrane is in contact with pool water. Roofing-grade EPDM is not used in Membriko pool installations.

**How long does installation take, and when can the pool be used after Membriko finishes?**

For a standard residential pool of 40 to 60 m² with normal structural preparation requirements, the full installation process — emptying, drying, preparation, membrane installation, seaming, penetration detailing, and termination — takes four to six working days. The pool is then filled gradually over 12 to 24 hours and monitored at full level for 72 hours before the handover inspection. Chemical start-up — pH adjustment, initial chlorination, and water balance — is completed before the first swim. From start of preparation works to the first use of the pool, the total elapsed time is typically seven to ten days. Commercial pools of 100 to 200 m² require five to eight working days for installation, with the same 72-hour monitoring period and water chemistry start-up sequence.
