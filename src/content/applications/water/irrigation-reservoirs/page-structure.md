# Irrigation Reservoirs — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The irrigation reservoir page targets a distinctly different audience from the swimming pool or
roofing pages. The primary reader is a Portuguese agricultural producer — farmer, herdeiro, agricultural
cooperative manager, or quinta owner — facing a specific operational problem: water is available
seasonally or in surplus periods, but is needed when it is scarce. On-farm water storage is the
solution, and EPDM geomembrane is the enabling technology that makes that storage reliable and
long-lasting.

The persuasion architecture must acknowledge the agricultural context honestly: these are people
who make economically driven decisions, who understand seasons and soil, and who are accustomed to
being sold products that underperform. The tone should be direct, technically credible, and rooted
in the Portuguese agricultural reality — drought cycles, the Alentejo landscape, EU subsidy frameworks
(PDR2030), and the specific crops and irrigation systems used in Portugal.

Secondary audiences include:
1. Agricultural engineers and consulting agronomists specifying reservoir construction
2. Civil and geotechnical contractors building or rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure
3. Rural property owners and quinta managers investing in long-term water security
4. Irrigation cooperative managers responsible for shared water storage infrastructure

The page must address the lifecycle economics directly — EPDM is not the cheapest liner on a per-square-metre
basis, but it is the lowest total cost solution when viewed over a 30-50 year horizon. It must also
address the regulatory context of APA licensing and PDR2030 subsidy eligibility, which are concrete
financial considerations that motivate investment decisions.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Agricultural Water Crisis

**Purpose:** Establish shared context with the reader on the severity and immediacy of Portugal's
agricultural water challenge.

**Content:**
- Open with the Portuguese drought reality: 2022 drought, reservoir levels at 33% of capacity,
  €900 million in crop losses; the pattern of worsening drought frequency across the Alentejo,
  Algarve and interior regions; the temporal mismatch between rainfall (Oct-Apr) and agricultural
  demand (Jun-Sep)
- The on-farm reservoir as the strategic response: capturing winter rainfall for summer use;
  buffering against inter-annual variability; the difference between farms that had storage in
  2022 and those that did not
- The liner as the critical enabling component: a reservoir without an impermeable liner loses
  as much water to seepage as it captures; an impermeable liner is what converts earthwork into
  reliable water storage
- Membriko's position: based in Pombal, supplying EPDM geomembrane for agricultural reservoirs
  across central and southern Portugal, with a 20-year installation warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação Gratuita de Projeto"

## Section 2: Why EPDM is the Right Material for Irrigation Reservoirs

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the material science case for EPDM in the specific agricultural
context, differentiated from general waterproofing marketing.

**Content:**
- UV stability in exposed draw-down conditions: why exposed liner during summer drought is the
  most demanding UV exposure scenario — more demanding than pool use or roofing
- Chemical neutrality to irrigation water and soil: no plasticisers, no heavy metals, no biocides
  leaching into stored water; relevance for crop-sensitive irrigation (citrus, vine, market garden)
- Elongation and substrate accommodation: 400%+ elongation; why embankment settlement and soil
  movement are accommodated without stress cracking
- Root resistance: bankside vegetation root intrusion; FLL / EN 13948 test standard
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness options | 1.0 mm / 1.5 mm / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² (1.5 mm grade) | EN 12311-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Puncture resistance | ≥ 200 N | EN ISO 12236 |
  | UV resistance | No cracking at 5,000 hours xenon arc | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Section 3: Types of Irrigation Reservoirs

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko's expertise covers the full spectrum of on-farm and
cooperative water storage structures used in Portugal.

**Content:** Three infrastructure type cards.

**Charcas e Açudes (Small On-Farm Reservoirs)**
- Context: the traditional charca (farm pond) of the Alentejo and Ribatejo; typically 500-5,000 m³
  capacity; earthwork construction with vegetated embankments; historically lined with compacted clay
  or unlined (accepting seepage losses); the modern EPDM-lined charca as a reliable alternative
- EPDM benefit: 1.0-1.5 mm membrane installed on compacted earthwork base; capacity to line
  complex organic geometries; single Membriko panel possible for reservoirs under 15 m wide

**Tanques e Reservatórios de Betão (Concrete Irrigation Tanks)**
- Context: concrete-walled and -floored irrigation tanks; common in market garden operations,
  greenhouse complexes and drip irrigation systems; typically 50-1,000 m³; often used as the
  distribution buffer between the pump and the drip system
- EPDM benefit: 1.5 mm membrane bonded to concrete with immersion-rated adhesive; superior
  performance to bituminous coatings or epoxy paints for long-term watertightness; compatible
  with drip and pressurised irrigation system fittings

**Barragens Pequenas e Reservatórios de Rega (Small Earth Dams and Large Irrigation Reservoirs)**
- Context: earthfill embankment dams of 5,000-200,000 m³; common in Alentejo and Beira Baixa
  irrigation cooperatives and large quintas; often partially or fully relined as original compacted
  clay liner ages and loses impermeability
- EPDM benefit: large factory-fabricated panels (up to 4,000 m² per panel); minimal field seaming;
  installation on compacted earthwork with geotextile protection layer; embankment anchoring with
  concrete or earthfill anchor trench

---

## Section 4: Water Conservation in Portuguese Agriculture

**Purpose:** Establish the economic and environmental context that justifies investment in high-quality
liner systems.

**Content:**
- The cost of water loss: seepage rates in unlined earthwork reservoirs typically 5-15% of stored
  volume per day depending on soil permeability; at 10% per day, a 1,000 m³ reservoir loses 100 m³
  per day to seepage; the economic value of that water at Portuguese agricultural water prices
- Evaporation vs seepage: both are losses; EPDM liner eliminates seepage; floating cover
  eliminates evaporation; the relative magnitude of each in Portuguese summer conditions
  (Alentejo pan evaporation 4-5 mm/day, versus seepage losses that may equal or exceed this)
- Water pricing context: the economic value of stored irrigation water in Portugal (agricultural
  water tariffs, the cost of alternative sources)
- Climate trajectory: IPCC projections for Portugal; the 2022 drought as the new baseline;
  on-farm storage as risk management for agricultural businesses

   calculation, panel fabrication layout, anchor trench design, inlet/outlet structure specification
3. **Escavação e Terraplanagem** — Earthwork excavation and grading; embankment compaction to
   specification (typically 95% Standard Proctor); removal of organic material, sharp stones and
   debris from the liner contact zone
4. **Preparação da Base** — Fine grading of the base and embankment surfaces; installation of
   geotextile protection layer (300-500 g/m² non-woven) on the compacted surface to protect
   the EPDM from residual point loads
5. **Desenrolamento e Posicionamento da Membrana** — Unfolding of factory-fabricated EPDM panels;
   positioning and alignment; temporary anchoring during installation
6. **Emendas em Campo** — Field seaming of panel overlaps with QuickSeam tape (150 mm width)
   and QuickPrime Plus primer; seam testing with probe and spark testing where specified

   earthfill); management of inlet, outlet and overflow structures with EPDM pipe boots and
   penetration flanges
8. **Enchimento e Monitorização** — Controlled reservoir filling; settlement monitoring during
   first fill; inspection of seams and anchor zones; handover with Membriko 20-year warranty
   certificate and maintenance guide

- Geotextile protection layer specification: weight, material, purpose; the critical role of the
  protection layer in preventing substrate particles from concentrating point loads on the liner
- Inlet and outlet structures: EPDM-compatible pipe penetration details; anti-seep collars;
  overflow spillway design; protection against erosion at outlet
- APA licensing: the documentation requirements for reservoir construction licence applications;
  how EPDM geomembrane specification documentation (CE marking, EN 13956 certification) supports
  the environmental impact assessment submission

liners — evaporation, UV intensity, drought duration, and temperature extremes.

**Content:**
- Alentejo summer conditions: ambient 35-40°C, exposed liner surface 70-85°C; EPDM service
  temperature -45°C to +130°C — full comfort zone; HDPE and PVC behaviour at the same temperatures
- Drought-period exposure: how draw-down exposes liner to UV; why this is the most demanding
  UV scenario for any liner material; EPDM's 5,000-hour xenon arc performance data
- Winter resilience: northern Portugal reservoir liners experience frost; EPDM flexibility at
  -45°C vs HDPE brittleness below 10°C

## Section 11: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that EPDM lined reservoirs require minimal ongoing maintenance and
provide practical guidance for agricultural users.

**Content:**
- Annual inspection: visual check of anchor trench, perimeter seal, pipe penetration zones,
  and any area of known embankment settlement; look for liner exposure above water level and
  UV-affected zones
- Vegetation management: bankside grasses to be kept trimmed; removal of any woody vegetation
  root systems within 1 m of the liner perimeter; control of algal growth in the reservoir
  (algae on the liner surface does not damage EPDM but can make the surface slippery)
- Repair procedure: EPDM geomembrane is repairable in field conditions; small punctures and
  tears repaired with EPDM patch and QuickSeam adhesive tape; larger repairs require partial
  reservoir draw-down
- What to avoid: heavy machinery or livestock on the liner; sharp agricultural tools near the
  liner surface; animal hooves can puncture 1.0 mm EPDM — fencing of the reservoir edge is
  recommended for livestock farms

## Section 12: Agricultural Subsidies and PDR2030

**Purpose:** Address the financial dimension that is often the deciding factor in agricultural
investment decisions.

**Content:**
- PDR2030 (Portugal's Rural Development Programme 2023-2027): investment support measures for
  agricultural water efficiency infrastructure, including on-farm reservoir construction and
  relining; eligible investment amounts and support rates (typically 40-65% subsidy for irrigation
  efficiency investments)
- Measure 1.1 (Investimento na Exploração Agrícola): eligibility criteria for water storage
  infrastructure; EPDM liner as a qualifying cost element

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail agricultural search intent and address the specific objections and
concerns of Portuguese agricultural producers.

1. **Qual a espessura de membrana EPDM recomendada para uma charca agrícola?**
   Thickness selection depends on reservoir size, traffic conditions and UV exposure duration.
   1.0 mm is adequate for small protected reservoirs with no vehicle or livestock access to the
   liner. 1.5 mm is the standard for most agricultural reservoirs. 2.0 mm is specified for
   reservoirs with long draw-down periods (maximum UV exposure), heavy algal growth environments,
   or where accidental traffic or animal access to the liner is a risk.

2. **O EPDM contamina a água de rega com plastificantes ou outros compostos?**
   No. EPDM contains no plasticisers, biocides or heavy metal stabilisers. The chemical neutrality
   of EPDM-stored water has been demonstrated in multiple independent studies and is supported by
   ACS/WRAS certification. EPDM is the liner material of choice for potable water storage and for
   sensitive agricultural crops, precisely because it does not contaminate stored water.

3. **Posso revestir uma charca existente que está a perder água?**
   Yes. Existing earth reservoirs with seepage losses are the most common application for Membriko
   in agricultural settings. The existing earthwork provides the structural shell; the EPDM liner
   is installed over the prepared surface to create the impermeable barrier. Typical preparation
   includes removal of sharp debris, fine grading of the base, and installation of a geotextile
   protection layer before the EPDM.

4. **Qual a vida útil de uma membrana EPDM num reservatório de rega em Portugal?**
   The projected service life of EPDM geomembrane in agricultural irrigation applications is 50+
   years, based on independent ERA and SKZ studies using Arrhenius accelerated ageing methodology
   applied to real in-service membrane samples. Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty.
   In Portuguese climatic conditions, the UV and thermal demands are higher than in Northern Europe,
   but EPDM's intrinsic UV stability through its saturated polymer backbone ensures performance
   well beyond the warranty period.

5. **O reservatório com EPDM é elegível para subsídios do PDR2030?**
   Yes, in most cases. On-farm irrigation water storage infrastructure, including reservoir
   construction and rehabilitation with EPDM lining, is an eligible investment category under
   PDR2030 Measure 1.1 (Investimento na Exploração Agrícola) for irrigation water efficiency.
   Membriko provides the technical specification documentation and cost breakdown required for
   PDR2030 applications. Support rates are typically 40-65% of eligible investment cost.

6. **Como se faz a ancoragem da membrana EPDM nos taludes da charca?**
   Perimeter anchoring is achieved by running the EPDM membrane to the top of the embankment
   and burying the edge in a concrete or compacted earthfill anchor trench of minimum 300 mm
   depth and 500 mm width. The anchor trench holds the membrane against the hydraulic load of
   the water column and resists wind uplift on the exposed liner during draw-down periods.
   Membriko designs the anchor trench detail to match the embankment geometry and liner dimensions
   of each specific project.

7. **O EPDM aguenta o pisoteio de animais ou a entrada de tractores?**
   EPDM is puncture-resistant but is not designed as a traffic membrane. Livestock hooves,
   particularly cattle and sheep, can puncture a 1.0 mm or 1.5 mm liner. For livestock farms
   where animal access to the reservoir edge is possible, Membriko recommends physical fencing
   of the reservoir perimeter. Tractor or vehicle access to the liner area during installation
   should be avoided; if access is required for construction equipment, temporary plywood spreader
   plates are used to distribute load and protect the membrane.

8. **A Membriko instala reservatórios fora da zona Centro de Portugal?**
   Yes. Membriko is based in Pombal (Leiria) and serves agricultural clients across mainland
   Portugal, with particular activity in the Alentejo, Ribatejo, Beira Baixa and Beira Interior
   regions where irrigation water storage need is greatest. Technical visits for project assessment
   are carried out across the country. Contact Membriko to discuss your project location and
   logistical requirements.
