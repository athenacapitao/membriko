# Irrigation Reservoir Lining with EPDM Geomembrane

## Agricultural Water Storage and the Case for Impermeability

Water is the defining constraint of Portuguese agriculture. Not land, not labour, not markets —
water. The farms and estates that thrive through Portugal's increasingly severe summer droughts
are, almost without exception, the ones that built or inherited adequate on-farm water storage
before the crisis deepened. The farms that suffered the worst losses in the 2022 drought — when
national reservoir levels fell to 33% of capacity in July and crop losses exceeded nine hundred
million euros — were often farms that had the rainfall, the catchment, and the soil to grow
productive crops, but could not bridge the gap between the last spring rain in April and the
first autumn rain in October without running out of stored water.

On-farm irrigation reservoirs — from the traditional earthwork charca of the Alentejo to large
earth-dam irrigation structures managed by regantes cooperatives — are the infrastructure that
closes this gap. But an irrigation reservoir is only as good as its liner. An unlined or inadequately
lined earthwork reservoir loses five to fifteen percent of its stored volume per day through seepage,
depending on the permeability of the underlying soil. A thousand-cubic-metre reservoir with a
poorly performing liner can lose a hundred to three hundred cubic metres daily to the ground —
water that was pumped, stored and budgeted for July irrigation, disappearing silently into the
water table below.

Membriko, based in Pombal in central Portugal, installs EPDM geomembrane liners for irrigation
reservoirs across mainland Portugal. We work with individual farmers, agricultural estates, horticultural
cooperatives and rural property managers to make their water storage infrastructure watertight and
durable for the long term. The EPDM geomembrane we specify is not a product decision made on price
— it is a technical decision made on evidence. This page sets out that evidence.

## Why EPDM is the Right Material for Irrigation Water Storage

The material selection for an irrigation reservoir liner is one of the most consequential decisions
in the infrastructure project. The liner must perform reliably for decades in conditions that combine
the worst aspects of multiple demanding environments: intense UV radiation during draw-down periods,
chemical and biological exposure from agricultural water chemistry, physical movement of embankment
soils through wet and dry seasonal cycles, and mechanical stress from wave action, pumped draw-down
flows, and the inevitable activities of farm operations near the water's edge.

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) rubber geomembrane meets every one of these demands
through a combination of material properties that no single alternative can match.

### UV Resistance in Exposed Draw-Down Conditions

The UV exposure scenario for an irrigation reservoir liner is more demanding than almost any other
geomembrane application. When a reservoir draws down during summer drought — precisely when the
liner is working hardest, precisely when evaporation is greatest and water is most scarce — the
liner surface above the water line is exposed to full, unattenuated solar radiation. There is no
water to attenuate UV. Surface temperatures on exposed black liner material in the Alentejo in July
reach seventy to eighty-five degrees Celsius. The membrane bakes in direct sun for weeks or months,
then is re-submerged when autumn rains refill the reservoir.

EPDM's UV resistance is not a surface treatment that wears off, not a UV stabiliser additive that
depletes over years, and not a property that the material's chemistry will eventually lose. It is
intrinsic to the polymer backbone. The main chain of EPDM consists of ethylene and propylene
monomers — fully saturated hydrocarbons containing no carbon-carbon double bonds. UV-driven
photooxidative degradation requires the presence of those double bonds as reaction sites. In EPDM,
they are absent from the main chain. The ENB diene monomer provides pendant unsaturation, but this
is consumed during the vulcanisation process and is not available for photooxidative attack in the
finished membrane. The result is a material whose resistance to UV is a consequence of its molecular
architecture, not a property that requires maintenance or renewal.

Supplementing this architectural resistance, carbon black filler — approximately forty parts per
hundred rubber by weight — provides a physical UV absorption layer at the membrane surface.
Five-thousand-hour xenon arc weathering tests under EN ISO 4892-3 (representing forty to sixty years
of Portuguese outdoor solar exposure) show no cracking, chalking or measurable loss of mechanical
properties in EPDM geomembrane. Membriko specifies membranes that carry this test data, not
manufacturer claims unsupported by independent evidence.

### Chemical Neutrality to Agricultural Water and Soil

Irrigation water applied to crops must meet quality thresholds for crop safety, and the liner material
must not add contaminants. This rules out any liner that contains leachable components — plasticisers,
heavy metal stabilisers, processing aids — that migrate into stored water under temperature cycling
and UV exposure.

EPDM contains no plasticisers. Its flexibility is a property of the vulcanised rubber network —
it does not require phthalate or adipate plasticisers to achieve workability, and therefore has
nothing to leach into stored water. It contains no heavy metal stabilisers of the type used in
some PVC formulations. It contains no biocides. The chemical profile of water stored in contact
with EPDM is the chemical profile of the incoming water — unaltered by the liner.

This chemical neutrality is backed by ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire, France) and WRAS
(Water Regulations Advisory Scheme, United Kingdom) certifications for water contact applications.
These are certifications developed for drinking water system components — standards considerably
more stringent than any formal requirement for agricultural irrigation water. Membriko provides
this certification documentation as standard on every irrigation reservoir project.

The chemical neutrality of EPDM is also relevant in the soil-contact direction. EPDM is stable
across the soil pH range of four to twelve — well beyond the range encountered in any Portuguese
agricultural soil. It is not affected by the microbial activity of the soil environment, and does
not interact with the mineral chemistry of clay, sandy or calcareous soils. In applications near
ecologically sensitive areas — river margins, groundwater recharge zones, wetland-adjacent land
designated under Reserva Ecológica Nacional — the absence of soil contamination from the liner
is both an ecological consideration and a regulatory advantage in licensing submissions to APA.

### Elongation and Embankment Movement Tolerance

Agricultural reservoir embankments are not structurally stable in the way a reinforced concrete
basin is. They are compacted earth — and compacted earth moves. The clay soils of the Alentejo
swell when wet and shrink when dry, creating seasonal volume changes that translate to differential
movement of the embankment surface. Freshly compacted fill settles under gravity and under
hydraulic loading during the first filling cycles. Root growth from bankside vegetation creates
localised stress concentrations. Wave action from pumped draw-down flows creates dynamic loading
on the embankment face.

EPDM's elongation at break of four hundred percent or greater (EN 12311-2) means the membrane
can accommodate substrate displacements of many centimetres without accumulating the stress
concentrations that would propagate to tearing or puncturing. This is elastic deformation —
the membrane stretches with the substrate movement and returns to its original geometry when
the movement reverses. This failure mode requires a macroscopic, visible deformation before
failure — the membrane signals distress long before catastrophic breach occurs.

This contrasts sharply with the failure mode of HDPE geomembrane, which can fail through
Environmental Stress Cracking (ESC) — a mechanism that produces brittle fracture at stress
concentration points with essentially no macroscopic deformation as a warning sign. An HDPE
liner can be performing normally in visual inspection and fail through ESC at a seam or anchor
trench transition without warning. Membriko's choice of EPDM for agricultural embankment applications
is, in part, a choice of failure mode — preferring the visible, progressive failure mode over
the sudden, unpredicted one.

### Root Resistance

Irrigation reservoir embankments are colonised by vegetation. Grasses, reeds, rushes and bankside
shrubs establish along the water margin and on the embankment slopes. Their roots grow through
the soil and toward the moisture-retaining membrane. Without a root-resistant liner, these roots
penetrate the membrane over years and create linear channels for seepage.

EPDM's root resistance is documented through FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung
Landschaftsbau) testing methodology and certified under EN 13948, developed for green roof applications
where EPDM membranes must resist root penetration from planted extensive growing media for decades.
The same resistance applies to the root systems of agricultural and riparian vegetation. Membriko
recommends regular trimming of bankside vegetation within one metre of the perimeter anchor trench,
but the EPDM membrane itself provides reliable root resistance without requiring chemical treatment
of the surrounding soil.

## Types of Irrigation Water Storage Structures

Membriko works across the complete range of agricultural water storage infrastructure found in
Portugal. The geometry, scale and construction method of each type creates specific requirements
that influence liner specification and installation approach.

### Farm Ponds and Small Earth Reservoirs (Charcas and Açudes)

The farm pond — charca in Portuguese agricultural terminology — is the most widespread form of
on-farm water storage in the Alentejo, Ribatejo and Beira Baixa. These are excavated earthwork
structures, typically holding five hundred to five thousand cubic metres, with natural soil base
and compacted earth embankments. Historically lined with compacted clay where suitable clay was
available on site, or left unlined in areas where clay was absent or costly to source.

An unlined farm pond in the clay-loam soils typical of the Alentejo loses five to fifteen percent
of stored volume per day through seepage. For a two-thousand-cubic-metre reservoir, this means
one hundred to three hundred cubic metres disappearing daily into the ground beneath — water
invested in capturing, pumping and storing that never reaches a crop root.

Membriko installs EPDM geomembrane of 1.0 mm or 1.5 mm on the prepared earthwork surface of
farm ponds, following geotextile protection layer installation. The organic, irregular geometry
of most farm ponds — shaped by topography rather than geometry — is readily accommodated by the
EPDM membrane, available in large factory-fabricated panels and with four-hundred-percent elongation
that conforms to curved surfaces and irregular transitions. Membriko designs the panel layout to
minimise field seaming on every project.

### Concrete Irrigation Tanks and Buffer Reservoirs

Concrete-walled irrigation tanks are the standard intermediate-scale water storage solution in
horticultural operations, greenhouse complexes, and drip irrigation systems where the tank serves
as the pressurised buffer between the pump and the distribution network. Capacities typically
range from fifty to one thousand cubic metres. Their structural rigidity is their advantage; their
limitation is that concrete cracks under thermal cycling and differential settlement, and the cracks
become pathways for seepage that no rigid coating can reliably seal long-term.

Membriko installs 1.5 mm EPDM geomembrane bonded to the concrete surface with immersion-rated
contact adhesive. The four-hundred-percent elongation of EPDM bridges existing concrete cracks
and accommodates future structural movement without transmitting those displacements to the liner.
This is the fundamental advantage over liquid-applied coatings and epoxy systems, which are rigid
after cure and crack wherever the substrate cracks. Membriko details all inlet, outlet and overflow
penetrations with flanged EPDM pipe boots — no silicone sealant as the primary seal, only certified
EPDM accessories designed for permanent immersion.

### Earth-Dam Irrigation Reservoirs (Barragens de Rega)

Earthfill embankment dams storing five thousand to two hundred thousand cubic metres represent
the backbone of irrigation capacity in Portugal's agricultural south. Many were constructed under
previous EU rural development programmes in the 1990s and 2000s, with compacted clay or concrete
face protection that has now aged and lost impermeability. The earthwork is sound — decades of
settlement mean it is often more stable than when first built — but the waterproofing is failing,
and the seepage losses are measurable.

Membriko approaches large reservoir relining with factory-fabricated EPDM panels of up to four
thousand square metres per panel, delivered folded to site and positioned using mechanical handling
equipment. Minimising field seaming is the primary quality objective: every field seam is a potential
vulnerability, and reducing seam length to the minimum achievable reduces risk. Panels are joined
with one-hundred-and-fifty-millimetre QuickSeam adhesive tape and QuickPrime Plus primer. Perimeter
anchoring uses concrete-backfilled anchor trenches at the embankment crest.

## The Economics of Seepage Control in Portuguese Agriculture

The financial case for investing in high-quality EPDM geomembrane lining is straightforward when
the numbers are set out honestly. Membriko works through this calculation with every prospective
client because the decision should be made on evidence, not on impressions about cost.

### Quantifying Seepage Losses

An unlined earthwork reservoir in a typical Alentejo clay-loam soil loses approximately five to ten
percent of stored volume daily through seepage. The precise rate depends on soil permeability,
hydraulic head, and the condition of any existing clay compaction layer. Membriko's pre-project
assessment includes a seepage rate estimate based on soil investigation and, where available,
historical reservoir level data.

For a five-thousand-cubic-metre reservoir with a seepage rate of five percent per day, the daily
seepage loss is two hundred and fifty cubic metres — ninety-one thousand cubic metres per year.
At a conservative agricultural water value of one euro per cubic metre (the approximate market cost
of purchased or licensed irrigation water in water-scarce areas), this represents ninety-one thousand
euros of water lost annually. An EPDM liner installation for a reservoir of this scale costs a
fraction of one year's seepage loss value. The payback period, before any subsidy consideration,
is typically measured in months, not years.

### The Value of Reliable Storage Through Drought

The economic calculus changes again when the analysis moves from average-year economics to
drought-year risk management. In 2022, farms with adequate on-farm storage and reliable liners
that held water through July and August were able to maintain irrigation regimes for olive and
vine crops at a critical fruiting period. Farms without storage, or with poorly performing liners
that had lost their impermeability, faced a choice between buying water at emergency prices or
watching crops fail.

A well-specified, properly installed EPDM liner is not just an operational investment — it is
agricultural risk management. Membriko's twenty-year installation warranty provides the certainty
that the liner will remain functional through the climate-driven stress events that are becoming
more frequent in Portugal's agricultural south.

## Installation Process: Eight Steps to a Watertight Reservoir

Membriko follows a structured eight-stage process that covers the complete project cycle from
initial site assessment to warranty handover. Each stage has a specific technical purpose — no
steps are ceremonial.

### Stage 1: Topographic Survey and Feasibility Assessment

Membriko's site visit is a technical investigation, not a sales call. The assessment covers:
- Topographic measurement of the existing or proposed reservoir footprint and embankments
- Soil investigation: visual and tactile assessment of base soil type, permeability classification,
  and the presence of organic material, sharp granular particles or angular stone that require
  treatment before liner installation
- Capacity calculation: useful volume at proposed crest elevation, freeboard requirement, and
  comparison with the irrigation demand calculation for the farm
- Access assessment: routes for material delivery (EPDM panels are large and require lorry access),
  mechanical handling equipment positioning, and site traffic management during installation
- Regulatory constraints: identification of any REN designation, proximity to watercourses, or
  other conditions affecting the APA licensing approach

The report from this visit forms the technical basis for Membriko's proposal.

### Stage 2: Detailed Design and Panel Layout

From the survey data, Membriko produces:
- Panel fabrication layout: the optimum division of the liner area into factory-fabricated panels
  of maximum achievable size, minimising the length of field seams
- Membrane thickness specification: 1.0 mm for small protected reservoirs; 1.5 mm for standard
  agricultural reservoirs; 2.0 mm for reservoirs with extended UV exposure, livestock access risk,
  or large hydraulic head
- Geotextile protection layer specification: minimum three hundred grams per square metre for fine
  soils; five hundred grams per square metre or greater for granular or rocky substrates
- Anchor trench geometry: standard section three hundred millimetres deep by five hundred millimetres
  wide, with concrete or compacted fill backfill
- Penetration accessory specification: inlet, outlet and overflow pipe boot sizes and flange types

This design package also serves as the technical specification for PDR2030 subsidy applications —
Membriko formats the documentation to meet DGADR submission requirements.

### Stage 3: Earthwork and Surface Preparation

For new reservoir construction, the excavation and embankment modelling is carried out by a
civil earthworks contractor to the geometry and compaction specification provided by Membriko.
For existing reservoirs being relined, the preparation involves cleaning and regularising the
existing surface.

The surface preparation requirements that Membriko supervises before proceeding to liner installation:
- Embankment and base compaction to a minimum of ninety-five percent Standard Proctor density
- Removal of organic material, tree roots, angular stones and debris from the liner contact zone
- Surface regularisation: protrusions greater than twenty millimetres are removed or filled;
  depressions greater than thirty millimetres are filled with compacted fine material
- Rounding of angle transitions at the base-to-embankment junction — the EPDM can accommodate
  angles down to ninety degrees with proper detail, but gradual curves reduce the risk of liner
  bridging under hydraulic load

### Stage 4: Geotextile Protection Layer Installation

Before the EPDM membrane is placed, Membriko installs a non-woven geotextile protection layer
across the entire liner contact area. The geotextile serves two distinct functions:

**Mechanical protection:** even visually fine soils contain angular mineral particles at the grain
scale. Under the hydraulic head of a full reservoir — which may be three to five metres of water
pressure at the base — these particles act as point loads against the underside of the membrane.
Over decades of service, unprotected membranes in point contact with granular substrates develop
localised stress concentrations that reduce long-term puncture resistance. The geotextile distributes
these loads over a larger area, eliminating the point contact condition.

**Sub-membrane drainage:** where groundwater levels can rise to or above the reservoir base elevation
(a common condition in Alentejo valley-bottom reservoirs during wet winters), a permeable geotextile
allows groundwater to drain and prevents hydraulic uplift pressure from accumulating beneath the
membrane. Without sub-membrane drainage, upward water pressure can lift and deform an empty or
partially empty liner — a condition that creates tensile stress at anchor trench transitions and
can eventually cause tearing.

### Stage 5: EPDM Panel Deployment and Positioning

Factory-fabricated EPDM panels arrive on site folded on pallets. Membriko deploys them using
mechanical handling equipment appropriate to the panel size and site configuration. On large
reservoirs, a winch or tracked vehicle with extension boom is used to position panels at the
base without dragging the membrane surface across the geotextile — friction during deployment
can disturb the geotextile and cause localised bunching beneath the membrane.

Panels are positioned according to the factory layout plan, with a minimum one-hundred-and-fifty-millimetre
overlap at all panel edges. Temporary perimeter anchoring holds panels in position during deployment
and prevents wind displacement before seaming is completed.

### Stage 6: Field Seaming

Field seaming is the quality-critical step of any geomembrane installation. Membriko's seaming
protocol uses proven EPDM system components:
- Solvent cleaning and degreasing of both surfaces to be joined with approved cleaner
- Application of QuickPrime Plus primer to both surfaces; activation time of fifteen to thirty minutes
  at normal working temperatures (longer at temperatures below fifteen degrees Celsius)
- Application of one-hundred-and-fifty-millimetre QuickSeam bonding tape, pressed firmly across
  the full seam width with a silicone roller to eliminate air pockets at the adhesive interface
- Probe testing of completed seams with a blunt-tipped metal probe — any point at which the probe
  penetrates indicates an unbonded area requiring repair before proceeding

For projects with specific quality assurance requirements, Membriko can supplement probe testing
with spark testing across the seam length, providing documented evidence of seam integrity.

### Stage 7: Perimeter Anchoring and Penetration Details

The membrane is run to the crest of the embankment with a minimum six-hundred-millimetre extension
beyond the liner termination line, folded into an anchor trench and backfilled. The anchor trench
must resist the pull-out force generated by the full hydraulic head on the liner and by wind uplift
on the exposed liner during draw-down periods. Membriko calculates the anchor trench geometry for
each project based on these design loads.

Inlet, outlet and overflow pipe penetrations are detailed with flanged EPDM pipe boots — the same
technology used in Membriko's pool and pond projects, scaled for the pipe diameters and hydraulic
pressures of agricultural irrigation systems. No silicone sealant is used as the primary seal at
any penetration: only certified EPDM mechanical sealing accessories, designed for permanent
immersion and UV exposure.

### Stage 8: Filling, Monitoring and Warranty Handover

The reservoir's first filling is a monitored process. Membriko remains on site for the initial
filling phase — typically to twenty-five percent of capacity — to inspect all visible seams, anchor
trench zones and penetration details as the hydraulic load comes on for the first time. This is
when installation imperfections become visible as stress concentrations.

At project completion, Membriko delivers:
- Twenty-year installation warranty certificate
- Technical installation report with photographic record of key installation stages
- Product data sheets, CE certification documentation and ACS/WRAS water contact certification
- Annual maintenance and inspection guide

## Sizing and Engineering Considerations

A reservoir liner without a correctly sized reservoir is not useful. Membriko has the technical
competence to support the hydrological and structural design of the reservoir, not just provide
the liner material.

### Reservoir Capacity Calculation

The useful storage volume needed for a farm irrigation system is determined by the seasonal water
balance: the total volume that must be stored in winter and spring to bridge the summer irrigation
deficit without exhausting storage. The key inputs are:

- **Catchment contribution:** the area of impermeable or low-permeability catchment draining to the
  reservoir inlet, the mean annual rainfall and its seasonal distribution, and the runoff coefficient
  (typically 0.3 to 0.7 for agricultural catchments depending on soil type and vegetation cover)
- **Demand:** the total irrigation volume requirement for the farm's crop area and crop types during
  the June-September deficit period, expressed as a daily or weekly schedule
- **Evaporation loss:** four to five millimetres per day in July and August in the Alentejo — a
  two-thousand-square-metre reservoir surface loses eight to ten thousand litres daily to evaporation
  regardless of liner quality; floating cover systems can reduce this by seventy to eighty percent
- **Reserve factor:** a safety margin on useful volume to account for inter-annual rainfall variability
  and the consequences of exhausting storage in a drought year

### Geotextile and Liner Thickness Selection

Membriko selects the geotextile protection layer weight based on an assessment of the soil particle
size distribution and the maximum hydraulic head in the reservoir. The liner thickness is determined
by three factors:

**UV exposure duration:** the longer the expected draw-down period (and therefore the duration of
liner exposure to direct UV), the greater the thickness recommended. For Alentejo reservoirs with
draw-down periods of three months or more per year, Membriko recommends 1.5 mm minimum and 2.0 mm
for maximum durability and reassurance.

**Puncture risk:** reservoirs adjacent to livestock areas, where animal access to the embankment
cannot be fully excluded, warrant 1.5 mm or 2.0 mm with additional geotextile protection on the
embankment face. Agricultural vehicle operations near the reservoir edge also argue for increased
thickness.

**Hydraulic head:** deeper reservoirs generate greater hydraulic pressure at the base. While 1.0 mm
and 1.5 mm EPDM both pass the EN 1928 hydrostatic test at 60 kPa, for reservoirs with greater
than four metres of design head, Membriko specifies 1.5 mm or 2.0 mm as standard practice.

## EPDM versus HDPE, PVC and Concrete Lining

Membriko presents this comparison honestly. The goal is to help clients make the right decision
for their situation — not to sell EPDM where a different material would genuinely serve better.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | PVC Geomembrane | Concrete / Shotcrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 30-50 years (ESC risk) | 20-30 years | 30-50 years (crack risk) |
| UV resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Good — carbon black | Moderate — additives deplete | N/A |
| Elongation / movement tolerance | 400% | 10-20% | 150-300% | 0% — rigid |
| Seaming method | Adhesive tape, no equipment | Thermal weld, certified operators | Solvent/thermal | Jointed concrete |
| Low-temperature flexibility | Excellent (-45°C) | Reduced below 10°C | Good | Unaffected |
| Water chemistry | Excellent — no leaching | Good | Moderate — plasticiser leach | Good |
| Substrate movement tolerance | Excellent | Poor — ESC risk | Good | Poor |
| 30-year cumulative cost index | 100 | 110 | 140 | 180 |

An honest note on HDPE: it is the most widely installed geomembrane material globally by volume, and
in many applications — particularly landfill containment, industrial pond lining, and applications
where the strict seam quality control of a specialist contractor can be guaranteed — it performs
excellently. Its limitations relative to EPDM for Portuguese agricultural reservoir applications are
the ESC failure mode (which gives no warning before failure), the reduced low-temperature flexibility
in northern Portugal's winter conditions, and the requirement for thermal welding equipment and
operator certification that adds installation cost and creates dependency on specialist availability
for repairs.

Concrete and shotcrete are appropriate where the structure must resist loads beyond hydrostatic
pressure — vehicle traffic on the base, heavy equipment operations, or structural integration with
other civil works. For pure water storage in embankment reservoirs, EPDM delivers the lowest long-term
cost per cubic metre stored.

## Climate Adaptation for Portuguese Conditions

### Alentejo Summer Thermal Conditions

The thermal environment in which a Portuguese agricultural reservoir liner operates is extreme
by European standards. Ambient air temperatures of thirty-five to forty degrees Celsius in July
are common across the Alentejo. A black EPDM liner surface exposed to full solar radiation under
these conditions reaches seventy to eighty-five degrees Celsius. Membriko specifies EPDM with a
continuous service temperature of negative forty-five to positive one-hundred-and-thirty degrees
Celsius — the liner operates with a forty-five-degree safety margin above the maximum surface
temperature experienced in Portuguese conditions.

HDPE becomes progressively stiffer at elevated temperatures and is susceptible to thermal creep
(permanent deformation under sustained load at temperature). PVC softens above sixty degrees
Celsius and can deform permanently at exposed embankment surface temperatures in Portuguese summer.
EPDM retains its mechanical properties and elastic recovery across this entire temperature range.

### Winter Conditions in Northern Portugal

Irrigation reservoirs in northern and interior Portugal experience sub-zero temperatures in winter.
The Beira Interior, Trás-os-Montes and Minho upland areas record frost periods that can be severe
in exposed locations. EPDM's glass transition temperature of approximately negative sixty degrees
Celsius means it remains fully flexible and elastic in all Portuguese winter conditions — including
periods of ice formation at the reservoir surface. Membriko's northern Portugal installations perform
identically to those in the warmer south, with no cold-weather modification to the specification.

### Managing Evaporation

In Alentejo conditions, pan evaporation rates of twelve hundred to sixteen hundred millimetres per
year — four to five litres per square metre per day in summer — represent a significant water loss
from any open reservoir surface. A two-thousand-square-metre reservoir loses eight to ten thousand
litres daily to evaporation, independent of the liner quality.

Membriko's EPDM base liner eliminates seepage entirely. For farms where evaporation loss is a
significant fraction of total useful storage, Membriko can install a floating EPDM cover in addition
to the base liner. The floating cover is a buoyant EPDM panel anchored at the perimeter, floating
on the reservoir surface and reducing evaporation by seventy to eighty percent. The combination of
impermeable base liner and floating cover eliminates both seepage and the majority of evaporative
loss — the lowest-cost, most durable solution for water retention in the Portuguese south.

## Regulatory Framework: APA Licensing and the Lei da Água

Irrigation reservoir construction in Portugal operates within a regulatory framework that Membriko
understands and actively supports clients in navigating.

### Lei da Água (Law 58/2005)

Portugal's Water Law, which transposes EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, establishes the
legal framework for water resource use and storage. The capture and storage of surface runoff —
rainwater and seasonal flows from the farm's own catchment — for agricultural use requires a
utilisation title (título de utilização dos recursos hídricos) from APA or the relevant Administração
de Região Hidrográfica.

On-farm rainfall capture is typically easier to licence than direct watercourse abstraction licences,
which are subject to increasingly stringent review and allocation restrictions as water stress in
Portuguese river basins intensifies. The regulatory environment increasingly favours on-farm storage
over direct abstraction — a structural incentive for the infrastructure investment that Membriko
supports.

### APA Documentation Requirements

For reservoir construction requiring APA licensing, Membriko provides a complete technical
documentation package:
- EPDM geomembrane product data sheet with CE marking (EN 13956)
- Declaration of Performance (DoP) document for the geomembrane
- ACS and WRAS water contact certification — demonstrating absence of chemical migration into
  stored water, relevant for environmental impact assessments near sensitive watercourses
- Installation methodology description: panel layout, seaming process, anchor trench specification,
  penetration details

This documentation supports both the environmental impact assessment component of the licence
application and the technical specification requirements of the civil engineering submission.

### REN and RAN Land Use Designations

The Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN) includes floodplains, aquifer recharge zones and water-body
buffers — precisely the areas most likely to be appropriate for reservoir construction. Building
within REN-designated land requires specific authorisation from the regional CCDR. Membriko's
EPDM liner specification — demonstrating chemical neutrality and absence of groundwater contamination
risk — is a relevant supporting document for these authorisation requests.

The Reserva Agrícola Nacional (RAN) designation protects high-quality agricultural land from
non-agricultural uses. On-farm irrigation infrastructure is generally compatible with RAN designations,
as it serves an agricultural purpose, but specific authorisation may be required for significant
earthwork operations.

## Maintenance of EPDM-Lined Irrigation Reservoirs

The maintenance demand of a correctly installed EPDM geomembrane liner is genuinely low — not
a marketing claim, but a consequence of the material's properties. EPDM does not require periodic
re-treatment, does not degrade in contact with water, and has no components that age at a different
rate from the base polymer. The practical maintenance programme for an EPDM-lined reservoir is
limited to annual inspection and vegetation management.

### Annual Inspection Procedure

Membriko recommends an annual visual inspection of the reservoir, ideally conducted with the water
level at seasonal low — typically late summer, before autumn rainfall begins refilling the reservoir.
The inspection covers:

- **Perimeter anchor trench zone:** check for erosion of the backfill, any movement of the liner
  above the anchor level, or signs of embankment settlement pulling the liner at the crest
- **Water-line zone:** the embankment face between the maximum and minimum water levels is the
  zone most subject to mechanical stress from wave action, freeze-thaw cycling, and the physical
  impact of debris floating against the liner. Inspect for any abrasion marks or creasing
- **Penetration fittings:** inspect inlet, outlet and overflow pipe boots for any sign of separation
  from the liner surface; check flange bolt torque on bolted fittings annually
- **Base area:** with the reservoir drawn down, inspect the base liner for any deposits of coarse
  sediment that might be concealing mechanical damage

### Vegetation Management

The perimeter vegetation management zone — one metre from the anchor trench on all sides — should
be maintained as short grass or bare ground. Woody vegetation (shrubs, brambles, trees) must not
be allowed to establish within this zone; their root systems will reach the anchor trench and, over
years, will work into the membrane transition zone. Herbaceous grassland on the embankment face
is beneficial for erosion control and does not present a root penetration risk to a properly
anchored EPDM liner.

### Field Repair

EPDM geomembrane is repairable in field conditions using standard EPDM system components:

**Small puncture or tear (under 50 mm):** draw the reservoir down below the damage point, dry and
clean the area with EPDM solvent cleaner, apply QuickPrime Plus primer, cut a patch of the same
EPDM thickness with minimum 100 mm overlap in all directions, press firmly with roller. The repair
is functionally identical to the original liner at that point.

**Larger damage or seam failure:** draw down to expose the affected zone, dry, clean, and apply
new QuickSeam tape with primer across the full affected length, plus a patch over any point damage.
Membriko's field repair teams can attend sites across Portugal for larger repairs.

## Agricultural Subsidies: PDR2030 and EU Rural Development Funding

The financial arithmetic of EPDM reservoir lining becomes substantially more favourable when the
available EU agricultural subsidy support is factored into the investment calculation. Membriko
works with farmers and their subsidy consultants to ensure that the technical documentation required
for PDR2030 applications is complete and correctly formatted.

### PDR2030 Eligibility for Reservoir Lining

Portugal's Rural Development Programme 2023-2027 (PDR2030) includes investment support for
agricultural water efficiency infrastructure, of which on-farm irrigation reservoir construction
and rehabilitation is an eligible category.

**Measure 1.1 — Investment in Agricultural Holdings:** the primary PDR2030 measure for on-farm
investment, supporting improvements in economic and environmental performance including water storage
and irrigation efficiency infrastructure. Support rates are typically forty to sixty-five percent
of eligible investment cost, with higher rates for farms in disadvantaged areas and for young farmer
applicants. EPDM geomembrane supply and installation is an eligible cost item within this measure.

**Measure 10 — Collective Irrigation Investments:** for regantes cooperatives and irrigation
associations, specific collective investment measures apply with generally higher support rates than
individual farm measures. Membriko has experience supplying and installing EPDM on cooperative
irrigation infrastructure projects.

### Membriko's Documentation for PDR2030 Applications

Membriko provides the following documentation package for PDR2030 applications:
- Technical project description and justification for the selected liner material and thickness
- Bill of quantities and detailed cost breakdown in the format required by DGADR
- Product data sheets for the EPDM geomembrane (CE marking, EN 13956 compliance, manufacturer
  specifications)
- Declaration of Performance (DoP) document
- ACS/WRAS water contact certification

Membriko coordinates directly with the client's subsidy consultant to ensure the technical file
integrates correctly with the financial and administrative components of the PDR2030 application.

## Integration with Irrigation System Design

A reservoir liner is one component of an irrigation infrastructure system. Membriko understands
how the liner specification and installation details interact with the irrigation system that draws
from the reservoir, and designs penetration details and outlet configurations to match.

### Drip Irrigation Systems

Drip irrigation — the dominant new installation technology in Alentejo viticulture, olive production
and horticulture — requires filtration of water before distribution to prevent emitter blockage.
The pump inlet at the reservoir and the filtration station location are determined partly by reservoir
geometry and liner penetration positioning. Membriko coordinates these details during project design
so that the inlet pipe boot and valve chamber positions suit the planned filtration and pump layout.

Drip irrigation systems operate at relatively low flow rates with continuous draw-down during
irrigation periods. Reservoir outlets for drip systems are typically a single flanged pipe boot
penetration with a gate valve assembly on the downstream side — straightforward to detail in EPDM
and to coordinate with the irrigation installer.

### Centre-Pivot and Sprinkler Irrigation

Pivot and sprinkler systems have substantially higher peak flow rates than drip systems — a hundred
cubic metres per hour or more for large pivot installations. The reservoir outlet for high-flow
systems requires a larger pipe diameter, potentially a suction manifold with multiple inlet points,
and a pump sump or wet-well design that prevents vortexing at low water levels. Membriko dimensions
these details in collaboration with the irrigation engineer responsible for the pump specification.

### Gravity Irrigation Systems

Gravity-fed systems — where the reservoir is at a higher elevation than the irrigated fields and
no pump is required — demand particular attention to the outlet design. The hydraulic head in a
gravity system can be three to ten metres, creating significant flow velocity at the outlet that
can cause erosion downstream. The outlet penetration detail in the EPDM liner must be designed
for long-term structural integrity under continuous flow, with an anti-seepage collar to prevent
preferential flow along the outer pipe surface.

### Overflow Spillway Design

Every reservoir with natural catchment inflow must have an overflow spillway designed for the
flood of record or design flood (typically ten-year to hundred-year return period depending on
reservoir scale and failure consequence). The spillway is generally a concrete or masonry structure
positioned at the embankment crest, outside the EPDM liner zone. The transition between the EPDM
liner and the spillway structure is a critical detail — Membriko designs the liner termination at
the spillway apron to prevent undercutting of the liner edge by spillway flows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What EPDM thickness should I specify for a farm irrigation pond in the Alentejo?**

For most agricultural reservoirs in the Alentejo — where summer draw-down periods of two to four
months expose the liner to direct UV radiation — Membriko recommends 1.5 mm as the standard
specification. For reservoirs where draw-down periods regularly exceed three months, or where
livestock access to the embankment cannot be fully excluded, 2.0 mm provides increased reassurance.
For small, well-protected reservoirs with no animal access risk, 1.0 mm is technically adequate.
Membriko assesses the specific conditions of each project and recommends accordingly.

**Will EPDM contaminate the water stored in my reservoir with plasticisers or other compounds?**

No. EPDM contains no plasticisers of any kind — its flexibility is an intrinsic property of the
vulcanised rubber network, not achieved through an additive that might leach. It contains no heavy
metal stabilisers and no biocides. The ACS and WRAS water contact certifications carried by the
EPDM Membriko specifies were developed for drinking water system components — a more stringent
standard than any formal requirement for agricultural irrigation water. Membriko provides this
certification documentation with every project as evidence, not just assurance.

**Can I reline an existing earth pond that is losing water to seepage?**

Yes. Relining existing farm ponds with inadequate seepage control is the most common application
Membriko encounters in agricultural contexts. The earthwork provides the reservoir geometry —
Membriko installs a geotextile protection layer and EPDM liner over the prepared soil surface.
In the majority of cases, the existing earthwork does not need to be demolished or rebuilt.
Preparation consists of cleaning, regularising the surface, removing sharp debris, and rounding
angle transitions — work that Membriko supervises as part of the installation contract.

**How long will an EPDM liner last in a Portuguese agricultural reservoir?**

The projected service life of EPDM geomembrane is fifty years or greater, based on ERA and SKZ
independent studies applying Arrhenius accelerated ageing methodology to real in-service membrane
samples aged twenty-eight to thirty-two years in field conditions. Membriko provides a twenty-year
installation warranty. Portuguese conditions — higher UV irradiance and higher peak surface
temperatures than Northern Europe — are at the demanding end of the service envelope, but EPDM's
intrinsic UV resistance through its saturated polymer backbone ensures that these conditions do
not compromise the fifty-year service life projection.

**Is an EPDM-lined reservoir eligible for PDR2030 subsidies?**

In most cases, yes. On-farm irrigation water storage infrastructure is an eligible investment
category under PDR2030 Measure 1.1 (Investment in Agricultural Holdings) and related measures
for irrigation efficiency. Support rates are typically forty to sixty-five percent of eligible
investment cost. Membriko provides the complete technical documentation required for PDR2030
applications: project description, bill of quantities, product data sheets, CE certification and
Declaration of Performance. Contact Membriko to discuss your project and the applicable PDR2030
measures.

**How is the EPDM liner anchored at the top of the embankment?**

The standard anchor detail carries the membrane to the embankment crest and a minimum of six
hundred millimetres beyond, folding the edge into a concrete-backfilled or compacted-fill anchor
trench. The trench is a minimum of three hundred millimetres deep and five hundred millimetres
wide. The backfill mechanically locks the liner against pull-out forces from the hydraulic head
and wind uplift. Membriko calculates the anchor trench geometry for each project based on the
maximum design water head and the local wind exposure conditions.

**Can EPDM withstand cattle walking on the embankment near the water's edge?**

EPDM geomembrane is not a traffic membrane. Cattle and sheep hooves exert concentrated point loads
that can puncture 1.0 mm and 1.5 mm EPDM, particularly at the embankment face near the water
margin where the liner transitions from the embankment slope to the open water. For livestock farms
where animal access to the reservoir perimeter cannot be fully controlled, Membriko recommends
installing permanent stock fencing around the reservoir perimeter, set back from the embankment
crest by a minimum of one metre. The submerged base liner is adequately protected by the water
column against bovine hoof pressure.

**Does Membriko install irrigation reservoirs across all of Portugal?**

Yes. Membriko is based in Pombal (Leiria) and operates across mainland Portugal. Agricultural
reservoir work is concentrated in the Alentejo, Ribatejo, Beira Baixa and Algarve regions where
irrigation water storage demand is greatest, but Membriko accepts projects from all regions. Site
visits for project assessment are conducted nationally. Contact Membriko to discuss your project
location, timeline and technical requirements.
