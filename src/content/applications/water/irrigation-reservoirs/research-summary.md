# Irrigation Reservoirs — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Agricultural Water Containment: Core Properties

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) geomembrane is the dominant material choice for agricultural
irrigation reservoirs globally because its performance characteristics align with the specific demands
of agricultural water containment better than any competing liner material. The key properties that
drive selection are:

**UV stability in exposed conditions.** Unlike swimming pool liners (mostly submerged) or roofing
membranes (applied to a structural substrate and often ballasted), irrigation reservoir liners are
frequently exposed directly to solar radiation for extended periods during reservoir draw-down cycles
— when water levels drop below the liner surface during drought or high-demand periods. EPDM's
saturated carbon-carbon backbone and carbon black loading (approximately 40 phr) provide intrinsic
UV resistance that does not deplete over time. Published xenon arc weathering data (EN ISO 4892-3,
5,000 hours, equivalent to approximately 40-60 years of Portuguese outdoor UV exposure depending on
Global Horizontal Irradiance) show no cracking, crazing or significant mechanical property loss.

**Chemical neutrality toward water quality.** Agricultural irrigation water must meet quality thresholds
for crop damage prevention. The principal concern with synthetic liners is leaching of plasticisers,
stabilisers, or biocides into stored water. EPDM contains no plasticisers (flexibility is intrinsic
to the vulcanised rubber network), no heavy metal stabilisers (unlike PVC, which requires organotin or
lead stabilisers in some formulations), and no biocides. The result is chemical neutrality to stored
water — relevant both for direct application irrigation and for aquifer recharge applications where
groundwater contamination must be prevented.

**Root and biological resistance.** Agricultural reservoir environments support biological activity
on and around the liner surface: algal growth, root intrusion from bankside vegetation, and microbial
biofilm. EPDM's root resistance is documented under FLL testing methodology (Forschungsgesellschaft
Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau) and EN 13948, developed for green roof applications where EPDM
must resist root penetration across decades. The same resistance applies to bankside grasses, reeds,
and agricultural vegetation that colonise reservoir embankments.

**Elongation and conformance.** Agricultural reservoir sites are rarely geotechnically stable in
the same way that structural concrete substrates are. Embankment settlement, differential compaction
of the base layer, and seasonal soil movement under the liner are common. EPDM's elongation at break
of 400-500% (EN 12311-2) allows the membrane to accommodate substrate movement without developing
the stress concentrations that would propagate to tears or punctures. This is one of the material's
most critical advantages over more rigid alternatives in agricultural applications.

## Portuguese Agriculture and Water Scarcity

Portugal faces the most severe structural water scarcity challenge in continental Europe outside Spain.
The national hydraulic context is defined by:

**Climate geography.** Portugal's rainfall is distributed extremely unevenly in space and time.
The north and northwest (Minho, Douro, parts of Trás-os-Montes) receive 1,000-3,000 mm per year,
while the Alentejo interior and the Algarve receive 400-600 mm — with significant inter-annual
variability. Crucially, rainfall is concentrated in the October-April period, while agricultural
demand peaks in June-September: the productive season and the dry season are nearly coincident.
This temporal mismatch is the fundamental driver for on-farm water storage infrastructure.

**Agricultural water demand.** Portugal's agricultural sector accounts for approximately 75-80% of
total national water consumption. The main irrigated crops — olive, vine, citrus, tomato, rice,
maize, market garden vegetables — require 400-900 mm of applied water during the growing season in
Alentejo and Algarve conditions. With surface water increasingly unreliable and aquifer extraction
under regulatory restriction, on-farm storage has become a strategic necessity rather than a
convenience for the majority of Portuguese farms in the southern half of the country.

**Drought frequency and severity.** Portugal's climate models project a continued increase in drought
frequency and severity under all IPCC emission scenarios. The 2022 drought was the most severe in
recorded Portuguese history, with reservoir levels nationally falling to 33% of capacity in July 2022
and crop losses estimated at over €900 million. Smaller droughts affected the country in 2017, 2019
and 2023. The economic case for on-farm water storage — buffering against short drought periods that
would otherwise destroy crops — has strengthened with each successive drought event.

**Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005) and regulatory framework.** Agricultural water use in Portugal is governed
by the Lei da Água (Law 58/2005, transposing EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC) and administered
by Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA). New water abstraction licences from rivers, streams and
aquifers are subject to increasingly stringent review and rationing. On-farm reservoir construction
using rainfall and authorised surface water is typically easier to licence than abstraction licences,
creating a regulatory incentive for farmers to invest in storage rather than relying on direct
watercourse abstraction.

## EPDM Geomembrane Technical Properties for Reservoir Applications

Agricultural irrigation reservoir liners operate under service conditions that differ from pool or
roofing applications in important ways:

**Exposure conditions.** Reservoirs are exposed to solar UV during draw-down periods when the liner
extends above the water surface. Unlike pools (where water attenuates UV), the exposed portion of a
reservoir liner may receive full solar irradiance for weeks or months during drought periods. EPDM's
UV stability is therefore tested more severely in this application than in most pool applications.

**Physical scale.** Agricultural reservoirs range from small on-farm charcas (1,000-5,000 m³) to
large capacity barragens de rega (20,000-500,000 m³). At this scale, liner fabrication requires large
panels manufactured and seamed to exact site dimensions. EPDM is available from European manufacturers
in factory-fabricated panels of up to 4,000 m² per panel, delivered folded to site and unrolled into
position — minimising field seaming relative to other liner materials.

**Soil contact on both faces.** In reservoir applications, the liner is typically in contact with
compacted soil on the lower face and water on the upper face. EPDM is chemically inert to soil
contact: it is not affected by soil pH (the material is stable from pH 4 to pH 12), soil chemistry,
or the microbiological activity of the soil environment. This is in contrast to some thermoplastic
geomembranes that may be affected by specific chemical contaminants in the soil contact environment.

## UV Stability in Exposed Water Containment: Technical Detail

The UV stability requirement for irrigation reservoir liners is arguably more demanding than for any
other EPDM application. A 500 m² reservoir draw-down to 20% of capacity exposes 400 m² of liner to
direct solar UV for the duration of the draw-down period — potentially months during a Portuguese drought.

EPDM's UV resistance mechanism is twofold:

**Saturated polymer backbone.** The main chain of EPDM is composed exclusively of ethylene and
propylene monomers — fully saturated hydrocarbons with no carbon-carbon double bonds available for
photooxidative attack. UV photons that impinge on the EPDM surface cannot initiate chain scission
through the primary photooxidative pathway (radical formation at double bond sites) because those
sites do not exist. The ENB diene monomer, which constitutes 2-8% of the polymer by mole fraction,
introduces unsaturation, but this is located in the pendant (side chain) position and is consumed
in the vulcanisation cross-linking reaction during manufacture. Post-vulcanisation EPDM has no
significant residual reactive sites.

**Carbon black UV absorption.** Approximately 40 parts per hundred rubber (phr) of carbon black is
incorporated into EPDM geomembrane formulations. Carbon black absorbs incident UV at the membrane
surface, converting it to heat, before it can penetrate to the polymer chains. This physical UV
absorption is independent of chemical reactivity and does not deplete over time. The combination of
intrinsic backbone stability and carbon black UV absorption means EPDM's UV resistance is permanent
and does not require sacrificial UV stabiliser additives.

Comparison with competing materials under UV exposure:
- **HDPE geomembrane:** carbon black loading provides substantial UV protection, but HDPE undergoes
  slow thermal oxidation at elevated temperatures that progresses with time; stress cracking sensitivity
  at temperature increases with UV exposure duration
- **PVC geomembrane (plasticised):** UV exposure accelerates plasticiser migration, causing progressive
  embrittlement; UV stabiliser additives deplete over 10-20 years, after which degradation accelerates
- **LDPE/LLDPE geomembrane:** moderate UV stability; carbon black provides protection but elongation
  properties at low temperatures are inferior to EPDM
- **Bituminous geomembrane:** UV-vulnerable if unprotected; typically requires mineral granule surface
  protection that adds installation complexity and cost

## EPDM vs HDPE vs PVC Geomembrane Liners

The three principal liner material choices for agricultural irrigation reservoirs are EPDM, HDPE,
and plasticised PVC. The comparison across the key performance criteria:

**HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) geomembrane:**
HDPE is the most widely specified geomembrane material globally by installed area, primarily because
of its low unit cost and established industry infrastructure. For agricultural reservoirs, its
principal technical limitations relative to EPDM are:

- Stress cracking sensitivity: HDPE is susceptible to Environmental Stress Cracking (ESC) at
  points of localised tensile stress — particularly at seam joints, at exposed anchor trench edges,
  and at points where the liner contacts angular substrate particles. ESC failure can occur without
  macroscopic elongation, making it difficult to detect before catastrophic failure.
- Limited low-temperature flexibility: HDPE becomes significantly stiffer below 10°C. Installation
  in cold weather conditions, and liner performance during winter periods in northern Portugal, may
  be affected.
- Seaming requirements: HDPE seams are made by thermal fusion welding (extrusion welding or hot-wedge
  welding), requiring specialised equipment, operator certification, and test weld programmes for
  each day's welding. Failed seams are the most common cause of HDPE liner failure.
- UV stress: long-term exposure to UV combined with elevated temperature (above 60°C, common on
  exposed dark liner surfaces in Alentejo summer) can accelerate thermal oxidative degradation even
  with carbon black protection.

**PVC (plasticised) geomembrane:**
Plasticised PVC is lighter and more flexible than HDPE, with good workability in the field. Its
primary limitations for agricultural reservoirs:
- Plasticiser migration and embrittlement: the mechanism is identical to PVC pool liners. In
  agricultural reservoir applications, the plasticiser migrating into the water represents a potential
  contamination concern for sensitive crops.
- Lower UV stability: UV stabiliser additives deplete over 15-25 years; unprotected PVC becomes
  brittle and prone to cracking.
- Temperature limitation: PVC softens above 60°C; exposed liner surfaces in the Alentejo in July
  can reach 70-85°C surface temperature.

**EPDM advantage summary for agricultural reservoirs:**
- No stress cracking mechanism — elongation failure mode requires visible deformation before failure
- Flexibility maintained to -45°C — full performance across all Portuguese climatic conditions
- No plasticisers — chemical neutrality to stored irrigation water and soil contact environment
- Superior UV stability through saturated backbone, not solely dependent on carbon black additives
- Field seaming with adhesive tape and primer — no specialised thermal welding equipment required
- Single large panels available factory-fabricated — minimising field seam length
- 50+ year documented service life — lowest long-term cost per litre of stored water

## Evaporation Reduction

Open surface water evaporation is a major concern in Portuguese agricultural water management,
particularly in the Alentejo where pan evaporation rates of 1,200-1,600 mm/year (approximately
3-4 mm/day in summer) are typical. A 1,000 m² reservoir surface loses approximately 1,000-1,600 m³
per year to evaporation alone under exposed conditions — a significant fraction of total storage
capacity.

EPDM geomembrane liner installation does not directly address evaporation (which requires floating
covers or shade structures rather than the base liner), but an impermeable EPDM liner eliminates
seepage losses — which in unlined or partially lined reservoirs can equal or exceed evaporative
losses. A properly lined and sealed reservoir retains the full stored volume minus evaporation,
rather than losing additional volume through soil seepage.

For reservoirs where evaporation reduction is a primary objective, floating EPDM covers (separately
anchored floating panels) can be installed in conjunction with the base liner. The combination of
impermeable base liner and floating cover can reduce total volume losses by 70-80% relative to an
unlined, uncovered reservoir.
