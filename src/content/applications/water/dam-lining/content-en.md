# Dam and Reservoir Lining with EPDM Geomembrane

## Portugal's Ageing Water Infrastructure and the Impermeability Problem

Water management in Portugal operates under conditions of increasing pressure. The country's
hydrological regime divides sharply between the wetter north — where the Minho and Douro
catchments receive 1,500-2,500 mm of annual rainfall — and the arid south, where the Alentejo
and Algarve average 400-600 mm. With drought cycles intensifying and agricultural water demand
rising to support the expansion of olive cultivation, almonds and citrus across the southern
interior, the ability to store water between wet seasons is not an engineering convenience but an
economic necessity.

Portugal's national large dam inventory — maintained by the Comissão Nacional Portuguesa das
Grandes Barragens (CNPGB) — records approximately 218 large dams by international classification
(height above 15 m or reservoir capacity above 1,000,000 m³). These major structures, operated
principally by EDP and EDIA, are well-maintained and monitored under the Regulamento de Segurança
de Barragens. But for every large dam in the Portuguese inventory, there are dozens of smaller
structures: açudes (weirs and small embankment dams), charcas (farm reservoirs) and barragens de
terra (earth fill dams) in the 2-to-15-metre height range. Between 12,000 and 15,000 such structures
are estimated to exist across the continental territory.

The great majority of these small structures were built between 1940 and 1985 using compacted
earthen embankments with clay-based waterproofing. They are now 40 to 85 years old. And the clay
liners that made them watertight have — in a significant proportion of cases — failed. Desiccation
cracking during drought years, root penetration from pioneer vegetation species, and differential
settlement have progressively destroyed the impermeability of liners that once functioned adequately.
The consequence is measured in metres of water lost to infiltration each season: a reservoir that
nominally holds 100,000 m³ but loses 40% to seepage through a degraded liner is not a water
storage asset — it is a maintenance liability.

Membriko, based in Pombal, is a specialist EPDM membrane contractor with deep expertise in dam
and reservoir rehabilitation using EPDM geomembrane. The EPDM geomembrane is the technically
correct solution for small and medium dam waterproofing because it unites properties that no single
alternative material provides: 300-400% elongation to accommodate substrate settlement without
rupture, tested hydrostatic resistance exceeding 200 kPa, intrinsic UV and ozone stability without
degradable surface coatings, root resistance for vegetated dam environments, and a projected service
life exceeding 50 years. This document explains the engineering, the regulatory framework, and the
Membriko installation process in the technical detail that specifiers and project owners require.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Geomembrane for Dam Lining

Selecting a geomembrane for dam and reservoir lining involves satisfying three simultaneous
engineering requirements that no compromise can relax: watertightness under sustained hydrostatic
pressure, tolerance of substrate deformation and settlement, and durability across a design life
of 50 years or more. A geomembrane that withstands pressure but cannot accommodate settlement
will tear. One that lasts 25 years but requires replacement before the asset is amortised creates
a recurring capital liability rather than a permanent solution.

EPDM geomembrane satisfies all three requirements simultaneously. The explanation is rooted in
polymer chemistry and mechanical engineering.

### The Chemistry of Long-Term Stability

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a vulcanised rubber elastomer whose principal polymer
chain consists exclusively of saturated carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds. This molecular
architecture has a defining practical consequence: the EPDM backbone contains no reactive sites
susceptible to attack by oxidising agents, UV radiation, atmospheric ozone, or the chemical
constituents of natural water (dissolved salts, humic acids, metal ions). EPDM's stability is not
maintained by surface stabiliser additives that deplete over time — it is intrinsic to the
vulcanised polymer network.

Compare this with flexible PVC geomembrane. PVC is inherently rigid and requires 25-40% by weight
of plasticisers (adipates or phthalates) to achieve the flexibility needed for reservoir lining.
These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to the PVC matrix — they are physically blended in
and migrate progressively into adjacent soil and water over decades, progressively stiffening and
embrittling the membrane. Field studies of PVC canal linings in the Iberian Peninsula document
elongation reduction from an initial 200%+ to below 50% after 10-15 years in Mediterranean outdoor
conditions. Membriko does not specify PVC for dam and reservoir applications.

### The Mechanics of Elongation

Elongation is the most critical mechanical property for dam geomembranes. An earth dam settles —
the question is not whether but by how much and over what period. Settlement by consolidation of
the clay core, thermal expansion and contraction through seasonal temperature cycles, and
deformation under variable hydraulic load as the reservoir fills and empties are all inevitable.
If the geomembrane cannot accommodate these deformations elastically, it will tear — and a tear
in an earth dam geomembrane is not a minor leak but the initiation of a seepage pathway that can
cause progressive internal erosion (piping) and potential structural failure.

EPDM geomembrane has 300-400% elongation at break. HDPE (high-density polyethylene) geomembrane —
the dominant material globally by installed area — has 12-15%. Flexible PVC geomembrane has
150-200%, reducing progressively as plasticisers migrate. For the small and medium earth dams that
Membriko serves in Portugal — structures where lifetime differential settlement of 50-200 mm is
realistic — EPDM's elongation is the decisive engineering criterion.

## Dam and Reservoir Types

Membriko has operational experience lining all typologies of small and medium hydraulic structures
present across the Portuguese landscape. The engineering approach adapts to each structure type,
but the EPDM geomembrane remains constant.

### Small Earth Dams and Açudes

The earth embankment dam is Portugal's most common small dam typology. Earthen fill with stone
pitching on the upstream face and a clay or natural soil impermeable core — constructed in tens of
thousands across the Alentejo, Ribatejo, Beira Interior and Algarve for irrigation, livestock
water supply, and fire-fighting reserves. The majority were built without formal engineering
supervision and with locally available materials.

Membriko installs EPDM geomembrane on the upstream face of these structures as the primary
waterproofing system — either for new construction or as rehabilitation of a degraded clay liner.
The standard approach includes a non-woven geotextile protection layer (300-500 g/m²) between the
stone or earthen substrate and the EPDM membrane, eliminating puncture risk under hydrostatic load.
The 1.5 mm membrane is anchored at the crest and the toe, with riprap (loose stone) placed over
the membrane for mechanical protection and wave load resistance.

Membriko's design for earth dam installations accounts for the realistic lifetime settlement of
the embankment and specifies the membrane elongation reserve and anchorage system to accommodate
predicted deformations with an appropriate safety margin.

### Concrete and Masonry Face Dams

Concrete-faced and masonry-faced dams — common in Portuguese constructions from the Estado Novo
period (1940s to 1970s) — frequently present impermeability deficits from shrinkage cracking,
construction joint failure, and carbonation of the concrete cover over the reinforcement. Crack
injection is a short-term repair: it seals the existing crack but does not prevent the crack from
reopening under future thermal movement.

Membriko installs EPDM geomembrane over the existing concrete or masonry face as a rehabilitation
overlay. The membrane is bonded or mechanically fixed to the prepared concrete after surface
preparation (filling open cracks, grinding sharp protrusions, capping anchor bolt heads). The key
advantage: EPDM's 300-400% elongation accommodates future crack movements elastically without
compromising watertightness — a guarantee that crack injection alone cannot provide.

### Agricultural Reservoirs and Open Water Ponds

Open irrigation reservoirs and livestock watering ponds — structures typically between 500 and
50,000 m³ in volume — represent Membriko's largest market segment by project count. These structures
are not regulated as dams under the Regulamento de Pequenas Barragens, but they are critical
infrastructure for agricultural operations across the Alentejo and Algarve.

Membriko installs 1.0-1.5 mm EPDM geomembrane on the floors and side slopes of these reservoirs,
with geotextile protection where the substrate contains stone fragments. Pipe penetrations, outlet
valves, and overflow structures receive EPDM-compatible flange and compression ring accessories
providing a permanent, maintenance-free watertight seal.

### Fire-Fighting Water Reserves

Following the catastrophic wildfire seasons of 2017 and 2023, Portugal has significantly expanded
its network of dedicated fire-fighting water reserves. These reservoirs — typically 100 to 2,000 m³,
positioned at strategic points in the urban-wildland interface — must remain permanently full,
withstand helicopter water scooping and tanker filling cycles, and require minimal maintenance in
remote locations.

Membriko installs 1.5-2.0 mm EPDM geomembrane in these reservoirs, specified for permanent full
water condition, UV exposure in woodland clearings, and extreme temperature cycling between winter
frosts in the highland interior and summer surface temperatures of 70-80°C on exposed black EPDM
under direct August sun. With a service temperature range of -60°C to +130°C, EPDM covers the
full envelope of Portuguese environmental conditions.

## Hydrostatic Pressure and EPDM Performance

The central engineering question for any hydraulic application is simple: will the membrane hold
water under pressure? For EPDM geomembrane, the answer is affirmative — and the technical
explanation of why it holds is more informative than the bare test result.

### Hydrostatic Mechanics

Hydrostatic pressure at the base of a dam with 10 metres of water head is 98 kPa — approximately
1 bar. At 20 metres head, 196 kPa. EPDM geomembrane at 1.5 mm thickness is tested to EN 1928
(Method B) at pressures exceeding 200 kPa without measurable water penetration. For all small and
medium dams in the Portuguese regulatory category (2-15 m height), EPDM's hydrostatic resistance
provides an adequate margin.

Hydrostatic resistance is not simply a matter of withstanding the frontal pressure. The geomembrane
must maintain watertightness without detaching from the substrate, without seams opening under
load, and without localised substrate irregularities creating stress concentrations that rupture
the membrane. EPDM's elongation is critical here: under hydrostatic load, the membrane deforms
elastically to conform to substrate irregularities rather than bridging them under tension as a
stiff geomembrane must. Conformance, not rigidity, is the correct response to substrate variability.

### Long-Term Creep Resistance Under Sustained Load

Thermoplastic geomembranes — HDPE and PVC — are subject to creep (progressive plastic deformation)
under sustained stress loads above a threshold. HDPE has a stress threshold for long-term creep
failure at approximately 40-50% of short-term tensile strength. Under sustained hydrostatic loading
over decades, thermoplastic geomembranes accumulate permanent deformation that can ultimately lead
to stress rupture at seam locations or at geometric transitions.

EPDM, as a cross-linked elastomeric network, resists creep through its molecular architecture:
deformations under load are elastic and recoverable, not plastic and cumulative. Sustained load
testing of EPDM geomembrane at 200 kPa for 100-hour test periods documents no measurable permanent
deformation. This elastic recovery behaviour is the physical basis for projected service lives
exceeding 50 years under dam lining conditions.

### Fill and Draw-Down Cycling

Portuguese agricultural reservoirs are typically operated on pronounced seasonal cycles: filling
during winter rainfall events, progressive draw-down through the summer irrigation season. The
upstream face of the dam transitions from full submersion to full air and solar exposure, with
this cycle repeating annually for the structure's lifetime. For a geomembrane, this combines
hydrostatic loading with alternating UV exposure — a more demanding regime than permanent
submersion.

EPDM tolerates these cycles without degradation because its UV resistance is intrinsic to the
polymer chemistry rather than dependent on a surface coating that degrades with exposure, and its
elasticity ensures the membrane recovers its geometry without permanent creasing or mechanical
fatigue after each hydraulic unloading cycle. Membriko documents this cyclic performance in the
technical specifications for each dam and reservoir rehabilitation project.

## Installation Process for EPDM Dam Geomembrane

Membriko follows a structured, documented installation process for dam and reservoir geomembrane
lining. The scale and site logistics of these projects differ substantially from pool or roofing
projects: surface areas of 500-10,000 m², remote site access, and the need to coordinate reservoir
draw-down with the project programme require systematic planning that begins weeks before membrane
installation.

### Step 1: Technical Survey and Site Assessment

Membriko conducts a full technical survey of each structure before any proposal is prepared:

- Topographic survey of the dam: height, crest length, upstream face inclination and irregularities,
  overflow structure dimensions and crest elevation, outlet pipe positions and diameters
- Visual inspection of the upstream face: existing stone pitching, concrete or bare earth condition,
  compaction state, rooted vegetation, zones of visible seepage
- Seepage history review: available records of toe drainage flow measurement, comparison with
  reference values for comparable structures, assessment of the seepage's source (face liner failure
  vs internal core deterioration)
- Singular point inventory: core drainage pipes, outlet valves, overflow weirs, monitoring
  instrumentation (piezometers, settlement gauges)
- Access assessment: road capacity for material delivery vehicles, manoeuvring space for installation
  equipment, on-site storage area for geomembrane rolls

This survey report forms the technical basis for the Membriko project proposal.

### Step 2: Surface Geotechnical Assessment

For dams with irregular substrate or an unknown settlement history, Membriko undertakes a
surface geotechnical assessment before geomembrane installation:

- Hand probe testing: identification of zones with soft soil, organic material, or loose stone
  requiring removal or stabilisation
- Dynamic penetration tests (DPSH) at selected points on the upstream face for bearing capacity
  verification
- Soil sampling where geotextile-substrate compatibility must be confirmed

This assessment is particularly important for older structures where the construction history
is not documented and unexpected substrate conditions could generate unforeseen stresses on
the installed geomembrane.

### Step 3: Waterproofing Design

The waterproofing design specifies:

- Panel layout: individual panel dimensions, seam locations (oriented parallel to the slope
  direction — vertical seams on the dam face — to minimise hydraulic peel stress on joints)
- Geomembrane grade: 1.0 mm for flat-bottomed agricultural reservoirs; 1.5 mm for sloped
  reservoir margins; 2.0 mm for earth dam faces above 5 m and exposed concrete dam faces
- Geotextile specification: weight (g/m²) and type (needle-punched non-woven) based on
  substrate stone size and maximum hydrostatic head
- Anchor trench detail: crest anchor trench (minimum 0.8 m depth, backfilled with compacted
  material); toe anchorage with mechanical fixing to concrete or stainless steel anchor profile
- Singular point details: EPDM pipe flanges, collar boots and compression rings for all pipes,
  valves and instrumentation penetrating the geomembrane

### Step 4: Surface Preparation

Surface preparation determines the durability of the installed geomembrane system. Membriko
applies the same rigour to this stage as to the membrane installation itself:

- Vegetation clearance: all vegetation on the upstream face and berms cleared to reservoir floor
  level; herbicide treatment where root systems extend below the surface; waiting period for root
  desiccation before geomembrane installation
- Organic material removal: soils with more than 5% organic content replaced with compacted
  granular material (coarse sand or fine gravel)
- Surface regularisation: protrusions above 50 mm (stones, root stumps, concrete fragments)
  removed; concave irregularities deeper than 100 mm filled with compacted material or mortar
- Sub-membrane drainage installation: where analysis indicates risk of sub-membrane uplift pressure
  (for example, in reservoirs that fill by rising groundwater table), Membriko installs a drainage
  blanket of sand or drainage gravel between the substrate and the geotextile, with a controlled
  outlet at crest or toe

### Step 5: Geotextile Protection Layer Installation

On stone or angular fragment substrates, Membriko installs a needle-punched non-woven geotextile
(300-500 g/m²) over the entire surface to be lined before EPDM geomembrane installation. The
geotextile serves two engineering functions:

- Puncture protection: distributes point loads from stone fragments under hydrostatic pressure,
  preventing stress concentrations that could puncture the geomembrane progressively over the
  service life
- Inter-face drainage: allows interstitial water migration between the substrate and the
  geomembrane to the drainage relief system, preventing sub-membrane pressure accumulation

Geotextile strips are overlapped by a minimum of 300 mm at joints without bonding — the overlap
is sufficient to maintain continuous puncture protection.

### Step 6: EPDM Geomembrane Installation

Geomembrane installation begins at the lower edge of the face (toe or reservoir floor) and
progresses upward to the crest. EPDM panels are unrolled from the bobbin onto the prepared
surface or geotextile, positioned in accordance with the panel layout design, and temporarily
secured with provisional anchors while final alignment is confirmed.

On inclined dam faces, Membriko uses a controlled winch or tractor arrangement to lift and
position large-length panels — panels of 30-50 m in length on dam faces of 10-15 m height are
routine for this project type. Precise positioning is critical to ensure seams coincide with
their designed locations and that installation slack accommodating overnight thermal contraction
is distributed correctly across the panel length.

### Step 7: Seaming and Seal Technology

Panel-to-panel seams are executed using the Firestone QuickSeam system:

- Surface cleaning of the seam area with QuickSeam lap sealant cleaner and clean rag
- Application of QuickPrime Plus primer to both surfaces of the overlap (100 mm minimum lap
  width; 150 mm for dam faces with more than 10 m water head)
- Application of QuickSeam 150 mm seam tape with hand pressure and silicone seam roller,
  ensuring complete contact without air voids
- Minimum 24-hour curing before subjecting the seam to hydrostatic load

For critical applications or where field conditions limit adhesive seam quality, Membriko offers
factory-style field-vulcanised splices using portable vulcanising press equipment. The vulcanised
seam produces a monolithic rubber joint equivalent to the parent membrane in all mechanical
performance metrics — seam strength is not a limiting factor.

Singular points — pipes, outlet valves, overflow weirs — receive pre-formed EPDM accessories
(pipe boots, flanges, compression ring seals) providing hermetic mechanical and chemical seals
between the geomembrane and metallic or concrete elements. Membriko does not use silicone or
bituminous mastics as the primary seal at dam geomembrane penetrations — only EPDM accessories
rated for permanent immersion are specified.

### Step 8: Seam Quality Control

After installation is complete, Membriko conducts systematic seam quality control:

- Probe test: a 1.5 mm diameter metal probe is traversed along the full length of every seam;
  any probe penetration requires the seam to be re-executed; unbroken resistance along the
  complete seam constitutes basic acceptance
- Peel test: 50 x 200 mm test specimens cut from parallel seam test strips are tested in
  tension; minimum peel strength of 40 N/cm width
- Electric leak detection (ELD) survey: for large or high-criticality installations, Membriko
  applies electric leak detection to the completed geomembrane — a voltage is applied between the
  geomembrane and the wet substrate; any pinhole or seam failure creates a detectable current path
  with millimetre-level location accuracy
- Systematic photographic record of all seam locations and singular points for the as-built file

### Step 9: Controlled Filling and Post-Installation Monitoring

Reservoir re-filling after installation proceeds under controlled conditions:

- Gradual filling at a rate that allows visual observation of the upstream face geomembrane during
  hydraulic loading
- Seepage flow measurement at the dam toe (using a sharp-crested weir gauge or volumetric meter)
  during filling and after water level stabilisation
- Comparison with pre-rehabilitation seepage measurements (where available) to quantify the
  impermeability improvement achieved
- Visual inspection of exposed geomembrane above the water line after first filling, verifying
  anchor condition and singular point accessories

The filling and monitoring report is delivered to the client as part of the as-built documentation
package and serves as the baseline reference for future annual monitoring inspections.

### Step 10: Warranty Certificate and Handover

At project completion, Membriko issues:

- 20-year installation warranty certificate
- As-built documentation package: approved panel layout, seam quality control records, ELD
  survey report where applicable, photographic record, material conformity certificates for
  geomembrane and geotextile
- Post-installation monitoring report with seepage flow data
- Maintenance and periodic inspection manual for the geomembrane system and riprap cover

This documentation package is designed to satisfy the technical documentation requirements of
CNPGB and the CCDRs for small dam rehabilitation projects regulated under the Portaria 256/2002.

## Seam Technology for Large-Scale Geomembrane Applications

The principal technical distinction between a dam geomembrane project and a pool or roofing
membrane project is scale — and the consequence of scale for seam management. A 3,000 m² dam
upstream face will typically contain 400-600 linear metres of seamed joints. A 60 m² residential
pool rarely has more than 15 metres of seaming. The ratio of seam length to membrane area is
substantially higher in dam applications, and the consequences of seam failure are more severe.

Membriko addresses seam quality in large-scale dam projects through three overlapping layers
of control:

**Layer 1 — Layout design:** The number of seams is minimised through use of the widest available
panel width (up to 15.25 m from roll), efficient geometry to suit the dam profile, and factory
pre-fabrication of complex panel shapes where this reduces field seaming. Every seam eliminated
at the design stage is a seam that cannot fail in service.

**Layer 2 — Controlled field execution:** Seams are executed under controlled atmospheric
conditions — minimum surface temperature of 5°C, dry surfaces, no strong wind contaminating
the bonding area. Where field conditions are variable, Membriko uses protective sheeting tented
over active seaming zones. Every seam operator is trained and certified in the QuickSeam system
by the product manufacturer. No seaming is carried out by personnel who have not completed this
certification.

**Layer 3 — Independent verification:** All seams are inspected by Membriko's quality control
supervisor, independent of the installation crew. Any seam failing the probe test is re-executed
immediately. The quality control record identifies each seam individually by reference to the
as-built layout, creating an auditable trail of seam acceptance.

For large-scale installations (above 5,000 m²) or for dams with water heads above 10 m, Membriko
can specify field-vulcanised seams as an alternative or complement to adhesive tape seaming.
Vulcanised seams require portable vulcanising press equipment and a longer cycle time per linear
metre, but produce a joint that — in peel testing — consistently fails outside the seam zone,
confirming that the seam is stronger than the adjacent parent membrane.

## EPDM vs HDPE, PVC, Clay and Geosynthetic Clay Liners

Membriko presents this comparison with technical objectivity. Every geomembrane and waterproofing
system has contexts in which it is the correct specification. The following analysis focuses on
the specific conditions of small and medium dam rehabilitation in Portugal.

| Property | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | Flexible PVC | Compacted Clay | GCL (Bentonite) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | 300-400% | 12-15% | 150-200% | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| Settlement tolerance | Excellent | Poor | Good | Poor | Moderate |
| UV resistance | Excellent (intrinsic) | Good (UV stabilised) | Moderate | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| Field seaming method | Adhesive tape (low equipment) | Hot wedge weld (high equipment) | Hot air / solvent | Not applicable | Overlap only |
| Plasticisers in water | None | None | Yes (migrate over time) | None | None |
| Desiccation resistance | Excellent | Excellent | Good | Poor | Poor |
| Root resistance | Excellent | Moderate | Poor | Poor | Poor |
| Service life | 50+ years | 40-50 years | 15-25 years | Variable (20-100 years) | 20-40 years |

**Note on HDPE:** For large dams (above 20 m height) and for landfill leachate containment where
the highest chemical resistance is required, HDPE is the global reference geomembrane. Membriko
acknowledges this position without reservation. For small and medium Portuguese earth dams — where
differential settlement governs membrane specification — the elongation case for EPDM is technically
clear.

**Note on compacted clay:** Compacted clay has a century-long pedigree in Portuguese earth dam
construction. Structures correctly built with quality, well-graded clay have functioned for
decades without intervention. However, rehabilitating an existing dam with a new compacted clay
liner is logistically complex and expensive — it requires reservoir emptying, excavation of the
deteriorated face, recompaction with quality-controlled clay material, and re-testing. EPDM
geomembrane installed over the existing face is, in most cases, substantially more economical and
faster to execute, with a 50-year service life that the compacted clay — without sustained
maintenance — rarely achieves after rehabilitation.

## Seismic Considerations for Portuguese Dams

Portugal is among the most seismically active countries in Europe. The Azores-Gibraltar fault zone
— the tectonic boundary between the Eurasian and African/Nubian plates — runs through the
mid-Atlantic and generates seismicity affecting the Azores archipelago, the southern margin of
continental Portugal, and the Strait of Gibraltar region.

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake (estimated magnitude Mw 8.5-9.0) remains the largest European
earthquake in the modern historical record, generating a tsunami that devastated the Portuguese,
Spanish and Moroccan coasts. The 1998 Azores earthquake (Mw 6.8, Faial epicentre) caused
significant damage across the archipelago. The seismic hazard maps published by LNEC (Laboratório
Nacional de Engenharia Civil) define zones of moderate to high seismicity across the Algarve,
Alentejo Litoral, the Setúbal peninsula, and the western Alentejo.

### How Seismic Events Affect Earth Dam Geomembranes

An earth dam subjected to earthquake ground motion experiences three primary mechanisms relevant
to geomembrane performance:

**Differential settlement:** Ground motion causes rearrangement of the embankment fill granular
structure, producing crest settlement and differential deformation of the upstream face. Documented
earth dam settlements during magnitude 6+ earthquakes range from 10 mm to 500 mm depending on
embankment height, fill compaction quality, and ground motion intensity.

**Reservoir seiching:** Seismic ground motion excites oscillation of the reservoir water surface
(seiching), generating waves that can overtop the dam crest in extreme cases or impact the upstream
geomembrane with wave loads substantially exceeding normal operational conditions.

**Shear deformation of the embankment body:** Differential lateral movement between embankment
layers during and after a seismic event transmits shear stress to the geomembrane, particularly
at horizontal seam locations and at connections to rigid structures (outlet pipes, overflow weirs).

### EPDM's Seismic Advantage Over HDPE

EPDM's 300-400% elongation allows it to accommodate the differential settlements described above
without membrane rupture. HDPE geomembrane, with 12-15% elongation, is at risk of panel rupture
or seam shear failure when embankment deformation exceeds its strain capacity. Documented case
studies from the Northridge, California earthquake (1994, Mw 6.7) and the Kobe, Japan earthquake
(1995, Mw 6.9) record HDPE geomembrane seam failures in waste containment facilities subjected
to embankment deformation — the failure mechanism is identical to that of an upstream dam face
lining under seismic loading.

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM geomembrane as standard for all dam rehabilitation projects in
seismic hazard zones A and B on the Portuguese national seismic hazard classification, with
enhanced seam specifications (minimum 150 mm lap, vulcanised seams for critical applications)
and anchor trench design with settlement accommodation built into the membrane slack budget.

## Environmental Compliance

Dam rehabilitation in Portugal operates within an overlapping framework of water resource
management, environmental protection, and hydraulic safety regulation. Membriko is familiar
with this framework in operational detail and communicates the regulatory implications clearly
to each client at the outset of every project.

### Lei da Água (Law 58/2005)

The Lei da Água transposes the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) into Portuguese law
and establishes the national water resource management framework. Construction or rehabilitation
of hydraulic works affecting classified water bodies — including dams and weirs on watercourses
classified under the national hydrographic network — requires a water resource use licence
(Título de Utilização de Recursos Hídricos, TURH) issued by APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente)
or the relevant ARH (river basin administration authority).

EPDM geomembrane is environmentally compatible with the water quality protection objectives of
the Lei da Água: it contains no plasticisers, heavy metals or biocides that migrate into the
impounded water or the receiving watercourse. In environmental impact assessments where Membriko
has participated, the absence of REACH-regulated substances of very high concern in the EPDM
formulation has been documented and recognised by the competent authorities.

### Regulamento de Segurança de Barragens (Decree-Law 4/2003)

Decree-Law 4/2003 and its supplementary instruments regulate the safety of large dams in Portugal.
The supervisory body is CNPGB. For structures within this regulation's scope, any impermeability
rehabilitation work requires detailed technical documentation including material specifications and
installation quality control records. Membriko prepares this technical dossier as a standard
deliverable for large dam rehabilitation projects.

### Regulamento de Pequenas Barragens (Portaria 256/2002)

Portaria 256/2002 governs dams between 2 and 15 m in height and/or with reservoir volumes between
100,000 and 1,000,000 m³. Owners of structures in this category are required to notify the
competent CCDR (Regional Coordination and Development Commission) of significant rehabilitation
works, submit technical project documentation for prior approval, and maintain an updated
inspection and monitoring register.

Membriko supports clients in preparing the required technical documentation and can coordinate
with the CCDRs on the notification and approval process, drawing on experience accumulated across
multiple small dam rehabilitation projects in the regions served.

### Reserva Ecológica Nacional and Hydraulic Domain

Many small Portuguese dams are located within zones classified as Reserva Ecológica Nacional
(REN) — specifically within the categories of watercourse beds and margins, maximum infiltration
areas, and flood-plain zones. Works in these areas require prior authorisation from the competent
Câmara Municipal and, depending on the nature of the works, a formal opinion from the ARH.

Membriko is thoroughly familiar with the REN authorisation requirements and assists clients in
preparing the descriptive reports and technical specifications required for permitting submissions.

## Maintenance and Monitoring

The maintenance demands of an EPDM geomembrane dam lining are substantially lighter than those
of the clay, concrete or PVC systems it replaces — a practical advantage that significantly
improves the whole-life cost comparison.

### Post-Installation Monitoring Programme

Membriko recommends and supports implementation of a seepage monitoring programme after each
installation:

- Installation of a sharp-crested weir gauge or flow meter on the toe drainage outlet for periodic
  seepage measurement
- Monthly measurements during the first year post-installation, quarterly thereafter
- Comparison with the baseline seepage values measured immediately after installation (which
  represent background seepage through the dam body, not through the geomembrane) for early
  detection of any performance change

### Annual Visual Inspection Protocol

Membriko recommends annual visual inspection of accessible geomembrane zones:

- Inspection of membrane above normal water level (the fluctuation zone): seam condition, crest
  anchor detail, pipe penetration seal condition
- Riprap and geotextile cover inspection: repositioning of displaced stone; condition assessment
  of exposed geotextile covering the membrane
- Singular point accessories inspection: flange and compression ring tightness; pipe boot and
  outlet valve seal condition

### Repair Procedures

EPDM geomembrane is repairable in the field without specialist equipment:

- **Damage above water level:** surface cleaned and primed with QuickPrime Plus; EPDM patch
  of matching thickness bonded with QuickSeam tape; typical repair time 2-4 hours for a single
  localised damage point
- **Damage below water level:** where possible, Membriko can undertake provisional underwater
  repairs using immersion-rated EPDM adhesive, allowing reservoir emptying to be deferred to a
  convenient date (end of irrigation season, for example); permanent repair requires localised
  emptying and patch bonding in dry conditions

## Rehabilitation of Existing Dams

Rehabilitation of dams with degraded impermeability — rather than dam reconstruction — is the
largest segment of the market Membriko serves. In Portugal, the great majority of small dams
presenting excessive seepage do not require embankment reconstruction: they require an effective
waterproofing system installed on the existing upstream face. EPDM geomembrane is that system.

### Surfaces Membriko Can Line with EPDM

**Bare compacted earth face (exposed soil after clay liner deterioration):** the most common
situation in ageing açudes that have lost their original clay liner. Membriko installs the
geotextile protection layer directly on the compacted soil (after regularisation and vegetation
removal) and then the EPDM geomembrane. No excavation or embankment reconstruction is required.

**Stone pitching (existing protective stone face):** Membriko installs the geotextile protection
layer over the stones for anti-puncture protection, then the EPDM geomembrane. The existing stones
serve as ballast for the geomembrane system.

**Cracked concrete face:** after preparation (open crack repair with epoxy mortar, protrusion
grinding, anchor bolt head capping), Membriko installs EPDM geomembrane directly over the
concrete. EPDM accommodates future concrete crack movements elastically within its elongation
reserve — under normal dam operational conditions, the magnitude of crack movement is a small
fraction of EPDM's elongation capacity.

**Shotcrete face:** direct installation over cured shotcrete, with geotextile protection layer
if the surface is rough.

### Conditions Requiring Prior Remediation

**Active internal erosion (piping):** if an active internal erosion pathway exists in the
embankment, installing a face geomembrane will eliminate the ingress of water that sustains
the erosion, but will not fill the void already formed. Membriko recommends prior geotechnical
verification and, where required, cement grout injection to consolidate the embankment before
geomembrane installation.

**Slope at angle steeper than stable:** if the upstream slope angle exceeds the angle of repose
of the embankment material, Membriko recommends slope regrading before geomembrane installation.

**Dense submerged vegetation:** aquatic plant root systems established in the upstream face must
be removed before geomembrane installation; Membriko coordinates herbicide treatment and the
appropriate waiting period before mobilisation.

All these conditions are diagnosed during the technical survey, and the client is informed clearly
in advance of what remediation is required before the geomembrane installation can proceed. There
are no surprises on site — only technical facts communicated before commitment.

## Frequently Asked Questions about EPDM Dam Lining

**Can EPDM geomembrane be installed over an existing stone-pitched earth dam face?**

Yes. The standard approach for stone-faced earth dams is to install a needle-punched non-woven
geotextile protection layer (typically 300-500 g/m²) over the stone pitching and then the EPDM
geomembrane over the geotextile. The geotextile bridges the gaps between stones and prevents
membrane puncture under hydrostatic load. Membriko specifies geotextile weight based on stone
size and maximum reservoir water head.

**What is the maximum dam height for which EPDM geomembrane is appropriate?**

EPDM geomembrane at 2.0 mm thickness is tested and approved at hydrostatic pressures exceeding
200 kPa — equivalent to approximately 20 m of water head. For small Portuguese dams (2-15 m
height) and agricultural reservoirs, this provides a comfortable safety margin. For dams above
15 m height, Membriko conducts a project-specific engineering assessment to determine the
appropriate minimum thickness, seam specification, and anchor system for the actual water head
and operational regime.

**Will EPDM withstand seismic loading in the high-hazard zones of southern Portugal?**

EPDM is specifically advantaged for seismic applications. Its 300-400% elongation allows it to
accommodate the differential settlement that earth embankment dams experience during seismic
events without membrane rupture. HDPE geomembrane, with only 12-15% elongation, is at risk of
seam failure or panel rupture when embankment deformation exceeds its elongation capacity — a
failure mode documented in California and Japanese earthquake case studies. Membriko recommends
EPDM 2.0 mm minimum for all dam rehabilitation projects in Portuguese seismic hazard zones A and B.

**What licences and regulatory approvals are required for dam rehabilitation with geomembrane?**

This depends on dam size and location. Dams regulated under Portaria 256/2002 (height 2-15 m)
require notification to the competent CCDR and, in most cases, prior technical documentation
approval. Structures in the hydraulic domain or affecting watercourses classified under the Lei
da Água require a TURH water resource use licence from APA. Membriko prepares the full technical
documentation package for regulatory submissions and can coordinate with the client's civil
engineering team on the permitting process.

**How long does installation take for a 3,000 m² earth dam upstream face?**

A 3,000 m² earth dam upstream face rehabilitation typically requires two to three weeks of
on-site work from mobilisation to completion, including surface preparation, geotextile
installation, EPDM geomembrane installation, and seam quality control. Reservoir draw-down and
re-filling time is additional and depends on reservoir volume and available inflow rate.

**Can EPDM be installed in cold weather or during winter in the Portuguese interior?**

EPDM itself is workable at any temperature encountered in Portugal — its glass transition
temperature is -60°C, far below any Portuguese winter condition. The QuickSeam adhesive system
requires that membrane surfaces are dry and at above 5°C for reliable seam bond formation.
Installation during rainfall is not recommended as surface water prevents adhesive bond
development. Membriko plans installation windows around weather forecasts for critical seaming
phases and uses protective sheeting over active work zones when conditions are variable.

**Can I line a concrete dam face with EPDM without removing the existing concrete?**

In the great majority of cases, yes. EPDM geomembrane can be installed directly over existing
concrete dam faces after surface preparation: filling of open cracks (which EPDM will subsequently
bridge elastically for future crack movement), capping of anchor bolt heads and other protrusions,
grinding of sharp spalls, and cleaning of oil or bituminous contamination. The prepared concrete
is bonded or mechanically fixed with the EPDM geomembrane. This approach eliminates the cost and
logistics of concrete demolition and significantly reduces the rehabilitation programme duration.

**What warranty does Membriko provide for dam and reservoir geomembrane lining?**

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty on all dam and reservoir geomembrane lining works.
This warranty covers defects in installation workmanship, seam integrity, and singular point
sealing details. The EPDM membrane product is complemented by the manufacturer's own product
warranty. For large infrastructure projects, Membriko can arrange insurance-backed performance
bonds as an additional assurance mechanism. All warranty terms are delivered in writing at project
handover as part of the as-built documentation package.
