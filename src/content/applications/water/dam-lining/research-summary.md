# Dam Lining — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM as a Geomembrane: Core Engineering Principles

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) has been used as a geomembrane in hydraulic engineering
applications since the late 1970s, with documented service histories in small dam linings, reservoir
impoundment, irrigation canals, and retention pond linings extending beyond 40 years. Its adoption
in geomembrane engineering is driven by a specific combination of properties that no competitive
material fully replicates: extreme elongation tolerance, resistance to hydrostatic pressure under
sustained loading, intrinsic UV and ozone stability without surface coatings, chemical inertness
to natural water constituents, and root resistance where vegetated dam faces are involved.

The core polymer chemistry is identical to roofing-grade EPDM — a saturated carbon-carbon backbone
with diene monomer (typically ENB, ethylidene norbornene) introduced at pendant positions for
vulcanisation cross-linking. The saturated main chain is the source of all key long-term stability
properties. For geomembrane applications, EPDM is formulated with:

- Higher carbon black loading (50-60 phr vs 30-50 phr for roofing): improves UV resistance and
  mechanical strength under long-term hydrostatic loading
- Stabiliser packages selected for aqueous immersion rather than atmospheric weathering
- Thickness grades: 1.0 mm (light-duty pond/canal lining), 1.5 mm (standard reservoir), 2.0 mm
  (dam facing, exposed geomembrane systems), 2.5 mm (high-head applications)

Geomembrane-grade EPDM is typically tested to ASTM D7465 (standard specification for EPDM
geomembranes) and to the relevant European standard EN 13491 (geomembranes — characteristics
required for use in the construction of tunnels and underground structures, which also covers
hydraulic applications in certain national contexts).

## Hydrostatic Pressure Resistance

The hydrostatic pressure a dam lining membrane must resist is the product of water density (1,000
kg/m³), gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²) and water head (depth in metres). At a water head
of 10 m — typical for a small earth dam or reservoir in Portugal — the hydrostatic pressure at the
base of the upstream face is approximately 98 kPa (≈ 1 bar). At 20 m head, 196 kPa.

EPDM geomembranes resist hydrostatic pressure through two mechanisms:

1. **Direct hydraulic resistance:** The membrane itself is watertight — its low water vapour
   transmission (< 2 g/m²/day for 1.5 mm EPDM, tested per EN 1931) prevents seepage under
   sustained pressure.

2. **Mechanical conformance:** EPDM's 300-400% elongation allows it to conform intimately to
   substrate irregularities and to deform without rupture as the substrate settles, swells or
   undergoes thermal movement. In contrast, a geomembrane with low elongation (HDPE: 12-15%;
   PVC reinforced: 15-25%) is at risk of tear-through if substrate differential settlement
   creates local stress concentrations.

Test data from EN 1928 (Method B — hydrostatic pressure test at 60 kPa, equivalent to 6 m
head) consistently confirms pass for pool-grade EPDM. Geomembrane grades tested at higher
pressures (100-200 kPa) also pass without measurable water penetration.

Under long-term hydrostatic loading, EPDM exhibits minimal creep compared to thermoplastic
geomembranes. HDPE under sustained tensile stress creeps continuously until rupture if the
stress exceeds the creep threshold (typically 40-50% of short-term tensile strength). EPDM,
as a vulcanised elastomeric network, resists creep through the cross-linked polymer architecture
— deformation is elastic and recoverable rather than plastic and cumulative.

## EPDM vs HDPE Geomembranes

High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is the most widely deployed geomembrane material globally by
installed area, primarily in large-scale applications: municipal solid waste landfills, large dam
facings, mine tailings impoundments. Its advantages are well-established: high tensile strength,
broad chemical resistance, well-established seam technology (extrusion and wedge welding), and
long documented field performance.

However, HDPE has specific limitations that make it less suitable than EPDM for small to medium
dam and reservoir applications in Portugal:

**Elongation and settlement tolerance:**
HDPE elongation at break is typically 12-15% (geomembrane grade, ASTM D6693). When the underlying
earth dam or reservoir substrate settles differentially — a common occurrence in the small
embankment dams typical of Portuguese agricultural and municipal reservoirs — HDPE cannot bridge
the settlement gap without rupture. EPDM's 300-400% elongation means it can accommodate substrate
deformation many times larger than HDPE before any risk of membrane failure.

**Installation on irregular surfaces:**
Small Portuguese dams frequently have irregular stone or earthen upstream faces that have not been
regraded for geomembrane application. EPDM's conformability to surface irregularity reduces
substrate preparation requirements. HDPE requires a smooth, granular-free surface (or protective
geotextile) to avoid stress concentrations under loading.

**Minimum installation temperature:**
HDPE becomes brittle and is difficult to handle and seam below approximately 5°C. EPDM's glass
transition temperature is -60 to -50°C, making it workable at any temperature encountered in
Portuguese field conditions, including winter installations in the interior highland regions.

**Seaming in field conditions:**
HDPE seaming (extrusion welding or hot wedge) requires specialised equipment, trained operators,
and controlled ambient conditions (temperature, humidity). EPDM seaming with adhesive tapes
(QuickSeam system) is less equipment-dependent and can be executed in a wider range of field
conditions, which is practically significant for remote dam sites with limited access.

**Puncture resistance:**
HDPE geomembrane at 1.5 mm thickness has lower puncture resistance than 1.5 mm EPDM due to
HDPE's lower elongation — at a point load, HDPE reaches its strain limit and ruptures where
EPDM stretches to conform to the protrusion. Puncture resistance is critical for dam linings
where stone substrate or maintenance traffic creates point loads.

## EPDM vs PVC Geomembranes

Flexible PVC geomembranes are used in reservoir and canal lining applications, particularly in
irrigation infrastructure. They are typically 0.5-1.0 mm thick, reinforced with polyester fabric,
and plasticised with 25-40% by weight of adipate or phthalate plasticisers.

For dam lining applications, PVC geomembranes share the same fundamental limitation as PVC pool
liners: plasticiser migration. Under conditions of prolonged soil contact (buried geomembrane on
the downstream face or under embankment material), plasticisers migrate into the adjacent soil,
progressively embrittling the membrane. UV exposure on the exposed upstream face accelerates
plasticiser extraction. Field studies of PVC canal linings in Spain and Portugal have documented
significant reduction in elongation (from initial 200%+ to below 50%) within 10-15 years of
outdoor service in Mediterranean climates.

EPDM's absence of plasticisers eliminates this degradation mechanism entirely. The same elongation
and flexibility that characterise fresh EPDM are maintained throughout the service life because
the elastomeric properties are intrinsic to the vulcanised polymer network, not dependent on a
migrating additive.

## EPDM vs Clay and Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCL)

Compacted clay liners (CCL) and geosynthetic clay liners (GCL, sodium bentonite between
geotextile layers) are traditional dam waterproofing approaches, particularly in Portugal where
small agricultural dams (açudes) have historically been constructed with clay cores.

Clay systems have inherent advantages: they are self-healing to a degree (swelling bentonite
bridges small cracks), they use locally available materials in clay-rich regions, and they have
a documented multi-century service history in traditional earth dam construction.

Their limitations in modern small dam and reservoir rehabilitation:

- **Dessication cracking:** clay liners exposed to air during dam emptying or drought desiccate
  and crack, permanently losing permeability performance. EPDM is unaffected by drying and
  rewetting cycles.
- **Differential settlement:** compacted clay is brittle relative to its permeability threshold
  — settlement gaps allow preferential flow. EPDM bridges settlement gaps elastically.
- **Vegetation penetration:** plant roots, particularly from pioneer species that colonise
  disturbed clay surfaces, penetrate clay liners within 1-5 years. EPDM is root-resistant.
- **Installation on existing dams:** applying a new compacted clay liner to an existing dam
  surface is logistically complex and requires significant earthworks. EPDM geomembrane can be
  installed on prepared existing surfaces without major earthworks.

GCL (geosynthetic clay liners) combine some advantages of both clay and geomembrane systems:
they are factory-manufactured to consistent quality, easy to install, and self-healing. However,
they share the dessication concern of clay liners and require continuous hydration to maintain
their impermeability — in dams that are periodically drawn down, this is a risk. A composite
system combining GCL and EPDM geomembrane addresses both limitations.

## Portuguese Dam Infrastructure Context

Portugal has one of the highest dam densities in Europe relative to its territory. The national
inventory maintained by the Comissão Nacional Portuguesa das Grandes Barragens (CNPGB) — the
Portuguese National Committee on Large Dams — records approximately 218 large dams (height > 15 m
or reservoir capacity > 1,000,000 m³), operated primarily by EDP (Energias de Portugal) and EDIA
(Empresa de Desenvolvimento e Infraestrutura do Alqueva).

Beyond these large structures, Portugal has an estimated 12,000-15,000 small dams and reservoirs
(açudes, charcas, barragens de terra) in the height range of 2-15 m and reservoir volume of
1,000-1,000,000 m³. These structures are distributed across the agricultural landscape and serve:

- Irrigation water storage for agriculture (dominant use, particularly in the Alentejo, Ribatejo
  and Algarve regions)
- Livestock watering
- Fire-fighting water reserves (a critical function given Portugal's wildfire risk)
- Municipal and industrial water supply for smaller settlements
- Recreation and aquaculture

The great majority of these small structures were constructed between 1940 and 1985 with earthen
or stone-faced embankment construction and clay or natural soil impermeabilisation. They are now
40-85 years old and many present significant impermeability deficits — either through natural
ageing of the clay core, vegetation penetration, or structural settlement creating leakage paths.

The annual volume of dam and reservoir rehabilitation work in Portugal is estimated at 50-80
significant projects per year, with EPDM geomembrane increasingly specified for small to medium
structures where the economics and logistics of geomembrane rehabilitation compare favourably to
embankment reconstruction or clay injection.

## Seam Technology for Large-Scale Geomembrane Applications

EPDM geomembrane systems for dam lining typically involve multiple membrane panels seamed
together in the field. The seaming system is the most technically critical element of any
geomembrane installation — a perfect membrane with poor seams will fail.

The industry-standard EPDM seam systems for geomembrane applications:

**QuickSeam system (Firestone Building Products):**
- QuickPrime Plus primer applied to both membrane surfaces to be seamed (150 mm minimum overlap)
- QuickSeam FormFlash or SA Flashing tape, 150 mm wide, applied under hand pressure and rolled
  with a silicone seam roller
- Seam strength tested by probe test (T-pull probe should not separate the seam) and peel test
  (minimum 40 N/cm peel strength per ASTM D413)
- In dam lining applications, seam laps are oriented parallel to the slope (vertical direction
  on the dam face) to minimise hydraulic loading on the seam line

**Vulcanised field splice:**
For critical applications or where geomembrane panels are seamed under conditions requiring
higher confidence, factory-vulcanised splices can be specified: the membrane panels are
overlapped and heat-cured in the field with portable vulcanising equipment. This produces a
true monolithic rubber joint equivalent in strength to the parent membrane.

**Seam testing:**
Large-area dam lining projects employ seam testing methods in addition to probe and peel:
- Air inflation testing: a thin channel formed in the double-track seam is inflated to 100-200 kPa
  and pressure held for 5 minutes — pressure drop indicates incomplete seaming
- Electric leak detection (ELD): a voltage is applied across the installed geomembrane while the
  substrate is wet; any pinhole in the membrane creates a detectable current path

## Seismic Considerations for Geomembranes in Portugal

Portugal is one of the most seismically active countries in Europe. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake
(Mw ~8.5-9) remains the largest recorded European earthquake in the modern era. The Azores
archipelago experiences frequent seismic activity (Faial earthquake 1998, Mw 6.8). The southern
Alentejo and Algarve are in seismically active zones (tectonic boundary between the Eurasian and
African/Nubian plates at the Azores-Gibraltar fault zone).

For dam geomembranes in seismic zones, EPDM's elastic recovery and high elongation are specific
advantages:

- **Earthquake-induced differential settlement:** small embankment dams are susceptible to
  differential settlement during seismic events. EPDM's 300-400% elongation absorbs relative
  displacements without membrane rupture that would cause catastrophic reservoir release.
- **HDPE vs EPDM in seismic events:** documented case studies of geomembrane performance in
  earthquakes (Northridge 1994, Loma Prieta 1989, Kobe 1995) show HDPE geomembranes are
  vulnerable to seam shear failure and panel buckling under seismic loading. EPDM's elastomeric
  properties allow the membrane to absorb shear strains without permanent deformation.
- **Portuguese national risk zones:** Decreto-Lei 4/2003 (Regulamento de Segurança de
  Barragens) requires seismic design verification for large dams. For small dams, the
  Regulamento de Pequenas Barragens provides guidance. EPDM geomembrane selection is consistent
  with seismic safety requirements for small dam rehabilitation.

## Environmental and Regulatory Context

The environmental regulation applicable to dam construction and rehabilitation in Portugal operates
through several overlapping frameworks:

**Lei da Água (Lei n.º 58/2005, transposing EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC):**
Establishes the framework for water resource management in Portugal, administered by the Agência
Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA). Dam construction or rehabilitation affecting water bodies classified
under the Lei da Água requires prior authorisation (licença de utilização de recursos hídricos).
EPDM geomembranes, with no plasticiser or heavy metal migration into water, are consistent with
the water quality protection obligations of the Lei da Água.

**Regulamento de Segurança de Barragens (Decreto-Lei 4/2003 and subsequent amendments):**
Establishes safety requirements for large dams in Portugal (height > 15 m or reservoir > 100,000 m³).
Administered by CNPGB (Comissão Nacional Portuguesa das Grandes Barragens) and ANPC (Autoridade
Nacional de Proteção Civil). Safety inspections and monitoring requirements are defined in this
regulation.

**Regulamento de Pequenas Barragens (Portaria 256/2002):**
Governs small dams (height 2-15 m, reservoir volume 100,000-1,000,000 m³). Requires design
documentation, safety inspection at completion, and periodic monitoring. Geomembrane rehabilitation
projects for small dams should be documented with technical specifications submitted to the
relevant CCDR (Comissão de Coordenação e Desenvolvimento Regional) for approval.

**Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN) and Reserva Agrícola Nacional (RAN):**
Dam construction or rehabilitation projects in REN or RAN classified land require prior
authorisation from the relevant municipal authority (Câmara Municipal) and national bodies.
Many small agricultural dams in Portugal are located in REN-classified floodplain land, making
environmental documentation critical.

**EPDM geomembrane environmental credentials:**
- No plasticisers or heavy metals that could migrate into the impounded water
- EPDM certified to NSF/ANSI 61 (drinking water contact) and in some formulations to EN 1200
  series for water contact applications
- At end of service life, EPDM is mechanically recyclable into rubber crumb (used in playground
  surfaces, road binders, athletic tracks)
- No persistent organic pollutants; EPDM is not classified as a persistent environmental contaminant
  under the Stockholm Convention or REACH regulation
