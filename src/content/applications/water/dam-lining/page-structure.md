# Dam Lining — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The dam lining page serves a narrow but technically sophisticated audience: municipal engineers,
agricultural landowners with small reservoirs, civil engineering firms working on hydraulic
infrastructure, and CCDR/APA-regulated project proponents requiring geomembrane specifications.
This is not a consumer page — the reader is a professional or an informed landowner who has already
identified the problem (a leaking dam or reservoir) and is evaluating geomembrane solutions.

The persuasion architecture must simultaneously establish technical credibility (EPDM is a serious
geomembrane material with documented field performance, not just a roofing product), demonstrate
Portuguese regulatory competence (knowledge of CNPGB, Regulamento de Segurança de Barragens, Lei
da Água), and address the specific material comparison the reader is likely making (EPDM vs HDPE,
vs clay, vs concrete facing). FAQs capture the specific technical and regulatory questions that
preoccupy dam rehabilitation project proponents in Portugal.

Portugal's unique combination of seismically active zones, Mediterranean climate extremes, and
a large inventory of ageing small agricultural dams creates a specific market context that no
generic geomembrane supplier can address with generic content. Membriko's local presence in Pombal
and deep EPDM expertise position it as the technically credible specialist for this application.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portugal's Ageing Dam Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Contextualise the problem and establish relevance before presenting technical solutions.

**Content:**
- Portugal's dam landscape: approximately 218 large dams plus an estimated 12,000-15,000 small
  agricultural dams (açudes, charcas, barragens de terra) in the height range 2-15 m
- The majority of small dams were constructed between 1940 and 1985 using earthen embankment and
  clay lining — now 40-85 years old; many present measurable impermeability deficits
- The two failure modes: impermeability failure (leakage through deteriorated clay or soil liner)
  and structural failure (seepage causing internal erosion / piping)
- The Membriko proposition: EPDM geomembrane rehabilitation as the technically correct and
  economically justified response to impermeability failure in small to medium dams and reservoirs
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / 300-400% elongation / Hydrostatic resistance to 200+ kPa /
  Seismic-tolerant elastomeric system / 20-year Membriko warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação Técnica"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Dam Lining

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the engineering case for EPDM as a geomembrane material.

**Content:**
- The three core engineering requirements for dam lining: watertightness under sustained
  hydrostatic pressure, tolerance of substrate settlement and deformation, and durability over
  50+ year design life
- How EPDM's saturated polymer backbone provides intrinsic chemical stability without degrading
  additives; how the vulcanised elastomeric network provides elastic recovery that thermoplastic
  geomembranes cannot match
- Physical data table:

  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness (standard reservoir) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Thickness (high-head / exposed) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 / GRI GM13 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 / GRI GM13 |
  | Puncture resistance | ≥ 89 N | ASTM D4833 |
  | Hydrostatic resistance | Pass at 200 kPa | EN 1928 (Method B) |
  | Tear resistance | ≥ 26 N | ASTM D624 die C |
  | Service temperature | -60°C to +130°C | — |
  | Dimensional stability | ≤ 1% at 70°C | GRI GM13 |
  | Projected service life | 50+ years | GRI / field data |

- GRI GM13 certification: the Geosynthetic Research Institute standard for EPDM geomembranes;
  equivalent to EN 13491 requirements for geomembrane use in hydraulic applications

## Section 3: Dam and Reservoir Types

**Purpose:** Establish that Membriko's EPDM solution addresses the full range of small to
medium hydraulic structures in Portugal.

**Content:** Four structure type cards.

**Small Earth Dams / Açudes (Barragens de Terra de Pequena Dimensão)**
- Most common small dam type in Portugal: earthen embankment, 2-10 m height, 1,000-500,000 m³
  reservoir; predominantly agricultural, irrigation and livestock water supply
- EPDM application: upstream face lining, from crest to toe, with geotextile protection layer
  where riprap or stone is placed over the membrane; 1.5 mm grade with protective cover
- Installation challenge: irregular, uncompacted upstream face surfaces — EPDM's 300% elongation
  tolerates substrate irregularity that would cause stress concentration in HDPE

**Concrete Face Dams and Reservoir Linings**
- Concrete-faced or masonry-faced dams where the original concrete or masonry face has cracked or
  suffered joint failure; also concrete reservoirs (betão armado) with impermeability failure
- EPDM application: membrane installed over the existing concrete face as a rehabilitation overlay,
  bonded or mechanically fixed; seams aligned with existing structural joints
- Advantage over concrete repair: EPDM bridges ongoing joint movement elastically; concrete crack
  injection seals the crack but does not prevent future movement

**Agricultural Reservoirs and Charcas**
- Open-air irrigation reservoirs and livestock watering ponds (charcas) — typically 500-50,000 m³;
  not classified as dams under the Regulamento de Pequenas Barragens but representing the largest
  single rehabilitation market segment in Portugal by project count
- EPDM application: full basin lining, floors and side slopes; 1.0-1.5 mm with protective
  geotextile where vehicle access is required for maintenance
- Key advantage: resistance to UV, vegetation root penetration and desiccation cycles, all of
  which degrade competing clay and GCL liners in intermittently full reservoirs

**Fire-Fighting Reservoirs (Reservatórios de Combate a Incêndio)**
- An increasingly critical infrastructure category in Portugal following the 2017 and 2023 wildfire
  seasons; small concrete or earthen reservoirs maintained full year-round for helicopter scooping
  and fire tanker filling; frequently located in remote areas with limited access
- EPDM application: full lining with 1.5-2.0 mm membrane, designed for permanent full-water
  condition, UV exposure, and infrequent maintenance access
- Key advantage: EPDM's resistance to UV degradation and temperature extremes is critical for
  exposed reservoirs in the high-risk fire zones of the Alentejo, Beira Interior and Trás-os-Montes

## Section 4: Hydrostatic Pressure and EPDM

**Purpose:** Address the core technical concern for any hydraulic engineer or informed landowner:
can the membrane hold water under pressure?

**Content:**
- Hydrostatic pressure mechanics: at 10 m water head, base pressure is 98 kPa (≈ 1 bar); at
  20 m head, 196 kPa — both well within EPDM's tested hydrostatic resistance (>200 kPa)
- Why elongation matters more than strength: EPDM passes hydrostatic tests not because it is
  rigid (it is not) but because it deforms elastically to fill any substrate gap or crack without
  rupturing. The membrane conforms to the substrate under hydrostatic pressure.
- Long-term creep resistance: EPDM vs HDPE under sustained load; vulcanised elastomeric network
  resists creep where thermoplastic geomembranes continue to deform under sustained loading
- Seam performance under hydrostatic loading: QuickSeam-bonded laps tested at pull-apart loads
  greater than the parent membrane strength; seam is not the weak point of the system
- Wave loading and draw-down cycles: reservoir draw-down (particularly seasonal Portuguese
  irrigation reservoirs) subjects the upstream face membrane to cycling between loaded and
  unloaded states; EPDM's elastic recovery means it returns to its original profile without
  wrinkling, buckling or stress fatigue

## Section 5: Installation Process (8 Steps)

**Purpose:** De-risk the procurement decision by presenting the installation process as
structured, controlled and professionally managed.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Vistoria Técnica e Levantamento** — On-site technical assessment: dam geometry, height and
   crest length; upstream face condition (stone pitching, concrete, bare earth); seepage
   monitoring records if available; reservoir capacity and operational regime; access constraints
   for machinery and materials
2. **Estudo Geotécnico de Superfície** — Assessment of substrate stability before geomembrane
   installation: probe testing for soft zones, loose stone, organic material that must be removed
   or stabilised; geotextile protection layer specification
3. **Projecto de Impermeabilização** — Layout design: panel dimensions and seam locations
   (seams parallel to slope direction); specification of geomembrane grade (thickness and
   certification); geotextile protection layer specification; anchor trench detail at crest and
   toe; penetration details for overflow structures, drainage outlets and instrumentation
4. **Preparação da Superfície** — Removal of vegetation, organic material and loose stone;
   grading of the upstream face to remove protrusions above 50 mm; filling of voids; installation
   of drainage blanket if required behind membrane; compaction verification
5. **Instalação da Geotextil de Protecção** — Installation of non-woven geotextile (300-500 g/m²)
   beneath the EPDM panel on stone or rough surfaces to prevent puncture under hydrostatic loading
6. **Instalação da Membrana EPDM** — Panel placement from toe to crest; mechanical fixation
   at anchor trench and crest termination; panel-to-panel seam bonding with QuickSeam system;
   penetration detailing at overflow weirs, pipes and drainage structures
7. **Controlo de Qualidade das Emendas** — Probe test and peel test on all seams; electric
   leak detection (ELD) survey on completed installation where reservoir re-filling requires
   confidence before full hydraulic testing; photographic record of all seam locations
8. **Enchimento Controlado e Monitorização** — Gradual reservoir refilling with monitoring of
   seepage rate (weir gauge or volumetric measurement) before and after lining; comparison of
   pre- and post-rehabilitation seepage to confirm impermeability; final inspection report and
   20-year Membriko warranty certificate

---

## Section 6: Seam Technology for Large-Scale Applications

**Purpose:** Address the specific technical concern for large-area geomembrane applications:
seam integrity at scale.

**Content:**
- Why seams are critical in dam lining: the membrane area-to-seam-length ratio is lower than in
  pool applications; a 2,000 m² dam upstream face may have 300-500 linear metres of seamed joints
- QuickSeam system specification: QuickPrime Plus primer, 150 mm seam tape, silicone roller
  application, minimum 100 mm overlap (increased to 150 mm in high-head applications)
- Seam orientation: parallel to slope direction (vertical seams on the dam face) — hydraulic
  loading acts perpendicular to seam direction, minimising peel stress
- Seam testing protocol: 100% probe test; minimum 5% peel test by area; ELD survey for large
  and critical installations
- Factory-fabricated panels: for large regular-geometry applications, membrane panels can be
  factory-fabricated with vulcanised seams to reduce field seaming; factory seam quality exceeds
  field seam quality in all performance metrics
- Penetration detailing: EPDM pre-formed boots, pipe flanges and collar seals for all pipe
  penetrations through the geomembrane; mechanical compression seals at overflow weir crests
  and outlet pipe penetrations

## Section 8: Seismic Considerations for Portuguese Dams

**Purpose:** Establish EPDM's specific advantage in the Portuguese seismic context — a
differentiating factor not addressed by generic geomembrane content.

**Content:**
- Portugal's seismic risk: Azores-Gibraltar fault zone; active seismicity in Algarve and southern
  Alentejo; ANEPC (Autoridade Nacional de Emergência e Proteção Civil) seismic risk maps
- Decreto-Lei 4/2003 (Regulamento de Segurança de Barragens) seismic design requirements for
  large dams; implications for geomembrane specification
- How earthquakes affect dam geomembranes: differential settlement of embankment; seam shear
  loading from embankment body deformation; wave surge loading from reservoir sloshing (seiching)
- Documented HDPE geomembrane failures in seismic events (Northridge, Loma Prieta) vs EPDM
  performance: elastic recovery absorbs seismic strain without permanent damage
- Design recommendations for seismically active zones: EPDM 2.0 mm minimum; vulcanised seams
  preferred for critical installations; anchor trench design to accommodate crest settlement

---

## Section 9: Environmental Compliance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate knowledge of the Portuguese regulatory framework for dam rehabilitation,
building confidence with the engineering and regulatory audience.

**Content:**
- Lei da Água (Lei n.º 58/2005): water resource management authorisation for works affecting
  classified water bodies; EPDM's absence of plasticiser migration supports water quality compliance
- Licença de Utilização de Recursos Hídricos: APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) authorisation
  required for works on dams with catchment area > defined thresholds
- Reserva Ecológica Nacional implications: many small dams are in REN-classified floodplain land
  requiring specific environmental permitting
- CNPGB oversight for large dams (> 15 m height or > 1,000,000 m³): technical documentation
  requirements including geomembrane specification and installation quality control
- EPDM geomembrane water contact certifications: NSF/ANSI 61 (drinking water contact); EN 13491
  compliance; no REACH-listed substances of very high concern in EPDM formulation
- End-of-life recyclability: EPDM mechanically recyclable; no environmental liability at
  decommissioning of the geomembrane system

## Section 11: Maintenance and Monitoring

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that EPDM dam linings have a structured and manageable maintenance
programme, and reassure the asset owner that the investment is protected long-term.

**Content:**
- Post-installation monitoring: seepage rate measurement (weir gauge or flow meter) at dam toe;
  comparison with pre-rehabilitation baseline to confirm impermeability improvement; schedule of
  annual seepage monitoring inspections
- Visual inspection protocol: annual inspection of exposed membrane areas (above normal water
  level); inspection of crest anchor detail; inspection of all pipe penetration seals; assessment
  of protective riprap or geotextile cover condition
- Repair procedures for mechanical damage: field repair with EPDM patch and QuickSeam adhesive;
  no specialist equipment required; reservoir draw-down only required if damage is below water line
- Protective cover maintenance: riprap displacement is the most common maintenance issue for
  covered EPDM dam linings; riprap must be repositioned to maintain membrane protection
- Membriko post-installation inspection offer: annual or biannual technical inspection with
  seepage monitoring report and condition assessment

---

## Section 12: Portuguese Dam Regulations

**Purpose:** Demonstrate specific knowledge of the Portuguese regulatory framework — a key
credibility signal for institutional and engineering clients.

**Content:**
- Regulamento de Segurança de Barragens (Decreto-Lei 4/2003 and amendments): scope, CNPGB role,
  inspection requirements, safety classification
- Regulamento de Pequenas Barragens (Portaria 256/2002): applicable to dams 2-15 m height;
  documentation requirements for rehabilitation works; submission to CCDR
- Lei da Água (Lei n.º 58/2005): water resource management authorisation framework; TITAP
  (Título de Utilização de Recursos Hídricos) requirements for works on classified water bodies
- APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente): environmental licensing for works in water courses and
  adjacent areas; SNIRH (Sistema Nacional de Informação de Recursos Hídricos) data obligations
- ANPC (Autoridade Nacional de Emergência e Proteção Civil): emergency planning obligations for
  dams with significant downstream population exposure; Plano de Emergência de Barragem (PEB)
- Membriko documentation package: technical specification, installation quality control record,
  seam test results, photographic as-built record, warranty certificate — designed to satisfy
  CNPGB and CCDR documentation requirements for small dam rehabilitation projects

---

## Section 13: Rehabilitation of Existing Dams

**Purpose:** Address the largest market segment — existing dams with impermeability failure.

**Content:**
- The rehabilitation case: most Portuguese small dams have clay or soil liners that have failed
  through dessication, root penetration or settlement; the choice is between dam reconstruction
  (costly, technically complex, potentially requiring decommissioning) and geomembrane rehabilitation
- EPDM rehabilitation over existing surfaces:
  - Earthen upstream face: grade, remove vegetation, install geotextile, install EPDM
  - Stone pitching: install geotextile protection layer over stone, install EPDM
  - Existing concrete face: install EPDM directly over prepared concrete (cracks filled, spalls
    repaired, anchor bolt heads capped); EPDM bridges future crack movement elastically
  - Shotcrete face: EPDM installed over blinded shotcrete with geotextile protection
- What cannot be overlined without prior remediation:
  - Active internal erosion / piping paths (must be grouted before geomembrane application)
  - Severely deformed or failed embankment slopes (must be regraded to stable angle before lining)
  - Active vegetation below water level (roots must be removed; herbicide treatment if necessary)
- Cost comparison framing: geomembrane rehabilitation typically costs 20-40% of full dam
  reconstruction; operational disruption is limited (reservoir drawn down and refilled in typically
  4-8 weeks depending on scale); no dam decommissioning or regulatory reclassification required

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture specific technical and regulatory questions from the professional and
landowner audience.

1. **O EPDM pode ser instalado sobre a face de uma barragem de terra com pedra de protecção existente?**
   Yes. The standard approach for stone-faced earth dams is to install a non-woven geotextile
   protection layer (typically 300-500 g/m²) over the stone pitching, then bond or mechanically
   fix the EPDM geomembrane over the geotextile. The geotextile bridges the gaps between stones
   and prevents membrane puncture under hydrostatic loading. The Membriko installation team
   specifies the geotextile weight based on stone size and water head.

2. **Qual a profundidade máxima de barragem para a qual o EPDM é adequado?**
   EPDM geomembrane rated to 2.0 mm thickness withstands hydrostatic pressures exceeding 200 kPa
   (equivalent to approximately 20 m water head) in standardised testing. For small Portuguese dams
   (height 2-15 m) and agricultural reservoirs, this covers all practical applications. For large
   dams above 15 m height, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm minimum thickness with enhanced seam
   specifications and a project-specific engineering assessment.

3. **O EPDM resistirá ao sismo em zonas de risco sísmico no sul de Portugal?**
   EPDM is specifically advantaged in seismic zones. Its 300-400% elongation allows it to
   accommodate the differential settlement that embankment dams experience during seismic events
   without membrane rupture. HDPE geomembranes, with only 12-15% elongation, are at risk of seam
   failure or panel rupture under earthquake-induced embankment deformation. Membriko recommends
   EPDM for all dam rehabilitation projects in the seismically active zones of southern Portugal.

4. **Que licenças e aprovações são necessárias para reabilitar uma barragem de terra com geomembrana?**
   This depends on dam size and location. Small dams (height 2-15 m, regulated under Portaria
   256/2002) require submission of rehabilitation documentation to the relevant CCDR and potentially
   to APA if the reservoir affects a classified water body under the Lei da Água. Large dams require
   CNPGB involvement. Membriko prepares the technical documentation package required for regulatory
   submission and can coordinate with the client's civil engineering team on the permitting process.

5. **Quanto tempo dura a instalação numa barragem de terra de 3,000 m²?**
   A 3,000 m² earth dam upstream face rehabilitation typically requires 2-3 weeks from mobilisation
   to completion, including surface preparation, geotextile installation, EPDM installation, seam
   quality control, and initial monitoring during re-filling. Reservoir draw-down and re-filling
   time is additional and depends on the reservoir volume and available inflow.

6. **O EPDM pode ser instalado em tempo frio ou chuvoso?**
   EPDM itself is workable at any temperature encountered in Portugal, including freezing
   conditions in the highland regions in winter. The QuickSeam adhesive system requires that the
   membrane surfaces are dry and at temperatures above 5°C for reliable seam bonding. Installation
   during rainfall is not recommended as surface water prevents adhesive bond. Membriko plans
   installation windows around weather forecasts for critical seaming phases, and tenting over
   the work area is used for projects requiring continuous progress in variable weather.

7. **Posso instalar EPDM sobre betão da face da barragem sem remover o betão existente?**
   In the large majority of cases, yes. EPDM can be installed directly over existing concrete dam
   faces after surface preparation: filling of open cracks (which EPDM will subsequently bridge
   elastically for future movement), capping of anchor bolt heads and other protrusions, grinding
   of sharp spalls, and cleaning of oil or chemical contamination. The EPDM membrane is then bonded
   or mechanically fixed to the concrete. This approach avoids the cost and logistics of concrete
   demolition and significantly reduces rehabilitation programme duration.

8. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para revestimento de barragens?**
   Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty on all dam and reservoir geomembrane lining
   works. This covers defects in installation workmanship, seam integrity, and penetration detailing.
   The EPDM membrane itself carries the manufacturer's product warranty. For large infrastructure
   projects, Membriko can arrange insurance-backed performance bonds as an additional assurance
   mechanism. All warranty terms are delivered in writing at project handover with the as-built
   documentation package.
