# Canal Lining (Revestimento de Canais) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The canal lining page serves a technically sophisticated audience that differs meaningfully from
the residential pool or roofing customer. The primary decision-makers are:

1. **Agricultural engineers and irrigation managers** at Associações de Regantes, EDIA,
   and other hydroagricultural organisations — technically trained, financially accountable,
   and already familiar with geomembrane terminology
2. **Farm owners and agricultural business owners** with significant irrigated land — motivated
   primarily by water efficiency and operating cost reduction, less technically focused
3. **Civil engineers and consultants** specifying rehabilitation solutions for deteriorated
   concrete canal infrastructure
4. **Municipal and regional water authorities** managing drainage and conveyance infrastructure

The page must simultaneously deliver technical depth (for the engineer) and clear economic
arguments (for the farm owner). Portugal's context is specific: the EFMA/Alqueva scheme is the
dominant reference point for southern irrigation; the Ribatejo/Tejo valley represents the largest
area of deteriorated concrete canal infrastructure; and rural water user associations are the
gatekeepers for collective canal rehabilitation decisions.

The persuasion architecture: open with the water efficiency crisis (seepage losses are a
recognised national problem), establish EPDM's technical solution, address all canal types,
provide the hydraulic efficiency data (which is often not communicated by competitors), compare
against concrete and HDPE, give a credible installation process, and close with Portuguese
infrastructure context and subsidy eligibility. FAQs address procurement-specific concerns
(subsidy eligibility, seaming width limits, regulatory compliance for irrigation water).

## Section 1: Introduction — Portugal's Irrigation Canals and the Water Loss Problem

**Purpose:** Establish the problem in terms the reader recognises from their own experience.
Connect to national water policy and the Alqueva context.

**Content:**
- Open with the scale of Portugal's canal infrastructure: the Alqueva scheme's 1,400+ km of
  primary canals; the national total of hundreds of thousands of kilometres of secondary and
  on-farm earthen channels; the fact that the majority are unlined or have deteriorated concrete
  linings
- The seepage data: unlined earth canals lose 30-50% of conveyed water before it reaches
  the field. In Portugal, where water is valued both economically (rising EDIA tariffs) and
  politically (EU Water Framework Directive targets), this is no longer acceptable
- The failure of concrete lining: concrete cracks within 10-20 years due to thermal cycling,
  settlement and alkali-silica reaction; cracked concrete linings lose 15-40% of flow —
  approaching the performance of unlined earth after failure
- The Membriko answer: EPDM canal lining reduces seepage to below 1%, lasts 50+ years,
  and can be installed over existing cracked concrete without demolition
- Stat block: 95-99% seepage reduction / 50+ years service life / 400% elongation /
  Applicable to earth and concrete substrates
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação de Canal" / "Request Canal Assessment"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Canal Lining

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the chemistry and physics argument for EPDM as the
superior canal lining material.

**Content:**
- The specific requirements of canal lining (versus pool or reservoir): differential settlement
  substrate, seasonal water level cycling, UV exposure on bank sections, variable water
  chemistry in irrigation water, potential for mechanical damage during maintenance
- EPDM's saturated polymer backbone: chemical inertness to irrigation water chemistry including
  dissolved salts, phytosanitary residues, and chlorinated treatment compounds
- The 400% elongation advantage: concrete cracks when substrate deforms; EPDM stretches and
  returns without loss of watertightness
- UV stability: EPDM above the waterline (freeboard zone and upper banks) exposed to full
  Portuguese UV dose performs as well as the submerged section — no degradation mechanism
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness (agricultural) | 1.0 mm / 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Thickness (civil/infrastructure) | 1.5 mm / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tear resistance | ≥ 20 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |
  | UV resistance | No surface degradation at 2,000 hrs | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
  | Seepage reduction | 95-99% | Field data |
  | Manning's n (roughness) | 0.010-0.014 | Hydraulic engineering data |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Section 3: Canal Types — Irrigation, Drainage and Ornamental

**Purpose:** Establish Membriko's EPDM as applicable across the full range of canal types,
not only agricultural irrigation.

**Content:** Three canal type sections.

**Canais de Irrigação (Irrigation Canals)**
- Agricultural irrigation: secondary and tertiary distribution channels from main schemes
  (Alqueva, Cova da Beira, Baixo Mondego, Tejo-Sorraia); on-farm earthen channels;
  direct abstraction channels from rivers and streams
- Key concerns: seepage loss reduction, seasonal operation, compatibility with agricultural
  water chemistry, subsidy eligibility
- EPDM benefit: 95-99% seepage reduction; eligible for PDR/FEADER funding; installed in
  days without curing delay that would interrupt irrigation season

**Canais de Drenagem (Drainage Canals)**
- Agricultural drainage channels removing excess groundwater and surface water from fields
- Municipal stormwater drainage channels conveying surface runoff to rivers or retention areas
- Key concerns: reverse hydraulic loading (pressure from groundwater side), resistance to
  suspended sediment abrasion, UV resistance in exposed sections
- EPDM benefit: resistant to reverse hydraulic pressure; Manning's n of 0.010-0.014 provides
  good conveyance capacity; flexible enough to accommodate foundation movement in drainage
  structures

**Canais Ornamentais (Ornamental Canals and Water Features)**
- Urban and landscape ornamental waterways: canal structures in public parks, quinta gardens,
  golf course water features, hotel landscape water channels
- Key concerns: aesthetic finish, waterproofing under variable water chemistry, long service
  life without maintenance interruption
- EPDM benefit: smooth black membrane provides a clean, contemporary aesthetic in
  ornamental contexts; alternatively can be covered with stone or aggregate topping for
  a natural appearance; waterproof for 50+ years without relining

## Section 4: Water Loss Prevention — The Seepage Data

**Purpose:** Quantify the economic case for canal lining with specific, credible data.

**Content:**
- Table of seepage loss by canal type (earth, concrete, EPDM)
- Economic calculation example: 0.5 m³/s canal, 40% earth seepage loss, 100-day irrigation
  season, EDIA water tariff €0.06/m³ — result: €430/year per km in avoidable water cost
- Payback calculation: EPDM installation cost per linear metre vs annual water cost savings;
  breakeven at 3-8 years depending on soil permeability, canal dimensions, and water tariff
- The concrete rehabilitation case: cracked concrete at 20-30% loss approaching earth canal
  performance; EPDM overlay over cracked concrete costs €15-35/m² installed vs €40-80/m²
  for concrete demolition and reconstruction; and delivers 50 years of service vs 20-25 for
  new concrete
- Reference to APA/SNIRH water scarcity data and EU Water Framework Directive obligations

## Section 5: Installation Process for Canal EPDM Lining (6 Steps)

**Purpose:** Make the installation process credible and predictable for the engineer or
farm manager who will plan the work schedule around the irrigation season.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Levantamento e Diagnóstico** — Topographic survey of the canal; measurement of cross-
   section dimensions (base width, bank slope, depth, freeboard); assessment of existing
   lining condition; soil type identification; water velocity and flow data collection;
   seepage assessment (if available)
2. **Dimensionamento Hidráulico** — Hydraulic design of the lined canal: Manning's equation
   calculation for flow capacity; confirmation that the reduction in cross-section (by liner
   thickness) does not compromise design flow; specification of membrane thickness and width
3. **Preparação do Substrato** — For earth canals: compaction and grading of the canal profile;
   removal of stones, roots and debris; application of protective geotextile where required;
   For concrete canals: cleaning of existing surface; repair of structural damage; grinding of
   sharp edges and protrusions that could cause stress concentrations in the membrane
4. **Instalação da Membrana** — Unrolling and positioning of EPDM panels along the canal;
   panel placement from the bottom of the canal upwards; overlap of adjacent panels with minimum
   150 mm; seam bonding with QuickSeam tape and primer; edge anchorage at the canal top with
   anchor trench and backfill or mechanical fixing to existing structure
5. **Emendas Transversais e Pontos Singulares** — Treatment of cross-canal seams at roll ends;
   EPDM details at intake structures, offtake gates, weirs, culvert entries and exits; flanged
   EPDM accessories at all penetrations
6. **Ensaio e Documentação** — Visual inspection of all seams; water fill test and seepage
   measurement; photographic record of completed installation; technical documentation for
   subsidy applications (PDR, FEADER) and compliance with DGADR (Direção-Geral de Agricultura
   e Desenvolvimento Rural) technical requirements

---

## Section 6: Canal Rehabilitation with EPDM

**Purpose:** Address the rehabilitation market — the large stock of deteriorated concrete
canals that represent the most immediate commercial opportunity.

**Content:**
- The rehabilitation case: most of Portugal's concrete-lined canals were built between 1940
  and 1990; many are now cracked, leaking and inefficient; the choice is between demolition
  and reconstruction (expensive, slow, disruptive) or EPDM overlay (cost-effective, fast,
  immediate improvement)
- What EPDM overlay achieves: the EPDM membrane bridges existing cracks and provides a new
  continuous impermeable layer; the concrete substrate provides structural support and protects
  the membrane from damage; the combined system is superior to either alone
- What can be lined over with EPDM: cracked concrete in structurally sound condition; jointed
  concrete panel systems with failed joints; concrete with ASR map cracking; concrete with
  biological fouling (after cleaning)
- What requires intervention before lining: structurally unstable concrete sections (areas of
  delamination, exposed reinforcement); active flowing groundwater infiltration into the canal
  bed from below (requires drainage or pressure relief before membrane installation); concrete
  with sharp reinforcement projections
- Speed of rehabilitation: comparison of EPDM overlay vs demolition/reconstruction timeline
  and cost
- Mention of eligibility for POSEUR/PT2030 infrastructure rehabilitation funding

## Section 7: EPDM vs Concrete / HDPE / Clay

**Purpose:** Provide the objective comparison that the technically sophisticated customer
(engineer, irrigation manager) will construct anyway — better that Membriko does it honestly.

**Content:** Comparison table.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | New Concrete | HDPE Geomembrane | Compacted Clay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Seepage reduction | 95-99% | 80-92% new; 60-80% after 15 years | 95-99% | 70-85% when wet; 10-30% when dry |
| Service life | 50+ years | 20-30 years (cracks) | 30-50 years | Permanent (if maintained) |
| Cold temperature | -45°C (remains flexible) | Brittle below -10°C | Brittle below -15°C | Freeze-thaw destroys structure |
| Seam/joint integrity | Continuous bonded seam | Expansion joints every 5-8 m | Hot-wedge welded seam | No seams |
| Installation speed | Fast — no curing delay | Slow — formwork, curing | Fast | Moderate — compaction required |
| Substrate tolerance | 400% elongation; installs over cracks | Cannot bridge cracks; substrate must be sound | 600% elongation; stiffer than EPDM | Conforms to substrate |
| Rehabilitation use | Yes — overlay over concrete | No — demolition required | Yes | No — not practical over concrete |
| Hydraulic roughness (Manning's n) | 0.010-0.014 | 0.012-0.016 | 0.009-0.012 | 0.022-0.030 |
| 30-year lifecycle cost | Low | High (crack repair + reconstruction) | Comparable to EPDM | Low (if materials available) |

Honest caveat: HDPE is technically comparable to EPDM in many canal applications and is
preferred in very large civil engineering projects where international procurement frameworks
favour standardised geomembrane specifications. For Portuguese agricultural and minor civil
applications, EPDM's field-friendly seaming system and better cold-temperature performance
make it the more practical choice. Clay lining remains viable where suitable clay materials
are locally available at low cost and where water velocity is low — Membriko does not argue
against its use in those specific conditions.

---

## Section 8: Flow Hydraulics and EPDM Surface

**Purpose:** Provide the hydraulic efficiency argument — a dimension rarely communicated
by competitors that represents genuine added value for irrigation engineers.

**Content:**
- Explanation of Manning's equation in accessible terms: smoother surface = higher flow
  velocity for same channel dimensions and slope
- Manning's n values comparison table (earth, concrete, EPDM, HDPE)
- Worked example: a 0.5 m base trapezoidal canal at 0.1% slope — flow capacity comparison
  between earth lining (n=0.025) and EPDM lining (n=0.012): approximately 52% increase in
  discharge capacity
- Practical implication: the same canal, after EPDM lining, can deliver 50% more water per
  unit time — or the designer can reduce the canal cross-section by 30% and achieve the same
  flow with lower construction cost
- Secondary hydraulic benefit: EPDM's smooth surface resists biological fouling (algae, reed
  establishment) better than rough concrete with open joint faces; less maintenance dredging
  required to maintain hydraulic capacity
- Note on high-velocity applications: for flow velocities above 2.0 m/s, Membriko specifies
  2.0 mm EPDM and recommends rock or concrete ballast on the membrane in areas of hydraulic
  turbulence at structures

## Section 9: Anchoring and Edge Details

**Purpose:** Demonstrate technical knowledge of the details that determine long-term
performance — this section is targeted at specifying engineers and quality-conscious
irrigation managers.

**Content:**
- The critical role of edge anchoring: an unanchored EPDM membrane will lift under hydraulic
  loading and wind suction; correct anchorage is the single most important detail in canal
  lining long-term performance
- Anchor trench method: the standard detail for earth canal banks — the membrane edge is
  buried in a trench of 300 mm depth and 300 mm width at the top of the bank, then backfilled
  with compacted soil; provides resistance to uplift from hydraulic pressure and wind
- Mechanical anchor bar method: for concrete canal banks or headwall structures — the membrane
  edge is mechanically fixed with a steel or aluminium anchor bar and stainless steel fixings
  at 300 mm centres, with an EPDM cover strip over the fixing points to maintain continuity
- Weir and intake details: EPDM membrane integrated with gate frame structures using flanged
  EPDM connections; the membrane is continuous through the structure opening and terminates
  in a sealed anchorage on the concrete frame
- Freeboard zone: the membrane should extend at least 300 mm above the design water level;
  in canals subject to flash flood events, Membriko recommends 500 mm freeboard; the above-
  water portion of the membrane is UV-exposed and must be the same quality EPDM as the
  submerged section
- Junction of EPDM with concrete headwall, cross-regulator gate or offtake structure: EPDM
  is turned up and bonded to the concrete structure; a bead of Lap Sealant covers the EPDM
  termination edge; a stainless steel drip flashing is applied over the termination to protect
  from mechanical damage and concentrate any waterflow away from the adhesive bond

## Section 11: Maintenance of EPDM Canal Linings

**Purpose:** Demonstrate the low maintenance burden of EPDM vs alternatives and provide
practical guidance for irrigation association managers.

**Content:**
- EPDM canal linings have minimal maintenance requirements compared to concrete (which
  requires periodic crack sealing) or clay (which requires annual inspection and repair of
  animal damage and settlement)
- Routine inspection: annual visual inspection at season-start recommended; focus on anchor
  trench zones (where settlement can expose and stress the membrane edge), structure interfaces
  (gate frames, offtakes, cross-regulators), and any areas subject to animal or machinery access
- Biological management: EPDM's smooth surface resists colonisation by aquatic vegetation
  better than concrete; occasional mechanical clearing (brushes, water jetting) may be required
  in stagnant water sections; EPDM is resistant to algaecides and herbicides used for canal
  weed control at normal application rates
- Rodent damage: burrowing animals (mole-rats, nutrias) are the primary mechanical threat to
  EPDM canal linings. Where this risk is high, Membriko recommends protective measures: concrete
  or stone ballast over the membrane in the bank zone, or 2.0 mm EPDM with a non-woven geotextile
  underlay that provides additional puncture resistance
- Repair procedure: small punctures and tears are repaired with EPDM patch and adhesive; the
  canal section is dewatered, the area cleaned and dried, and the patch applied with QuickSeam;
  typical repair time for a single damage point is 2-4 hours; large sections of damage require
  re-lining of the affected reach

## Section 12: Portuguese Water Infrastructure — Alqueva, EFMA and National Context

**Purpose:** Demonstrate Membriko's knowledge of the Portuguese irrigation sector and
establish relevance to the largest infrastructure projects.

**Content:**
- Alqueva/EFMA: the largest irrigation scheme in Western Europe; the primary distribution
  network is professional-grade civil engineering infrastructure; the secondary and tertiary
  on-farm network is primarily unlined or deteriorated concrete; Membriko's EPDM lining is
  appropriate for this on-farm network rehabilitation
- ARBVR (Ribatejo): among the oldest organised irrigation systems in Portugal; concrete
  infrastructure from the 1940s-1960s now requiring major rehabilitation; EPDM overlay over
  the existing concrete is the appropriate solution
- Subsidy framework: PDR (Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural) / PT2030 — irrigation
  infrastructure rehabilitation and water efficiency projects are eligible for up to 50% of
  eligible costs under agricultural measures; POSEUR (Programa Operacional Sustentabilidade
  e Eficiência no Uso de Recursos) — relevant for public irrigation infrastructure
- DGADR (Direção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural) technical requirements for
  subsidised irrigation infrastructure
- EU Water Framework Directive (Diretiva Quadro da Água): Portugal's obligation to achieve
  good ecological status in water bodies by 2027; reducing seepage from irrigation canals
  reduces return flow that can carry agrochemicals into groundwater, contributing to WFD
  compliance
- Reference to APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) water allocation and abstraction licensing
  that may require demonstration of efficient conveyance as a condition of the licence

---

## Section 13: Environmental Considerations

**Purpose:** Address the environmental dimension — increasingly important in subsidy
applications and in the context of Portugal's water scarcity challenges.

**Content:**
- Water conservation: every cubic metre saved by canal lining is a cubic metre that remains
  in the river system, reduces pressure on groundwater and contributes to biodiversity
  in aquatic ecosystems
- EPDM inertness: no plasticiser, biocide or heavy metal migration into irrigation water;
  water quality in EPDM-lined canals is unchanged from water quality at the abstraction point;
  relevant where irrigation water is used for food production and where residue regulations
  (EU Regulation 2023/915 on maximum residue levels) apply
- Carbon footprint comparison: EPDM production and installation has a lower embodied carbon
  than equivalent concrete construction per unit of service life; the longevity advantage
  (50 years vs 20-25 for concrete) further improves the lifecycle carbon position
- Recycling: EPDM membranes can be recycled at end of service life as crumb rubber; certified
  recycling pathways exist in Portugal through rubber recycling facilities
- Wildlife considerations: smooth EPDM canal lining can reduce the habitat value of canal
  margins for reptiles and small mammals compared to rough concrete (which provides crevice
  habitat); where ecological mitigation is required by environmental assessment, stone ballast
  or structured bank profiles can be incorporated at intervals

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Address the specific procurement and technical questions that irrigation
managers and engineers raise before specification.

1. **A membrana EPDM é elegível para apoios do PDR/FEADER em projetos de eficiência hídrica?**
   Yes — canal lining for seepage reduction qualifies as an irrigation efficiency measure under
   the PDR (Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural) and FEADER agricultural infrastructure measures.
   Membriko provides full technical documentation — installation specifications, product data
   sheets, seepage reduction data — for PDR/PT2030 application dossiers.

2. **Qual a largura máxima de canal que pode ser revestida sem emendas no fundo?**
   EPDM is available in widths up to 15.25 m. For a trapezoidal canal of 3 m base and 1:1.5
   bank slopes to 1.5 m depth, the total wetted profile is approximately 3 + 2×(1.5×√(1+1.5²))
   ≈ 8.4 m — within a single sheet width. Canals wider than this require longitudinal seams
   bonded with QuickSeam tape. Membriko designs seam layouts to minimise seam count and position
   seams above the canal invert where hydraulic stresses are lowest.

3. **Pode-se instalar EPDM sobre betão fendilhado sem demolição?**
   Yes — EPDM overlay over existing cracked concrete is one of the most common canal
   rehabilitation applications. The EPDM bridges the existing cracks and provides a new
   continuous impermeable layer, while the concrete provides structural support and protects
   the membrane from mechanical damage. The concrete must be in structurally sound condition
   (no delamination) and free from active groundwater infiltration from below.

4. **O EPDM é compatível com a água de rega que contém fitossanitários e fertilizantes?**
   Yes. EPDM's saturated polymer backbone is chemically inert to the full range of compounds
   present in agricultural irrigation water: mineral fertiliser salts, organophosphate and
   carbamate pesticide residues, copper-based fungicide solutions, and the low concentrations
   of chlorine sometimes used for algae control in irrigation distribution networks.

5. **Quanto tempo demora a instalar um quilómetro de canal de irrigação?**
   A standard team of 4-5 trained operatives installs approximately 200-400 linear metres per
   day on a prepared substrate. One kilometre of canal takes approximately 3-5 working days
   for a standard 1-2 m wide channel, or 5-8 days for a wider canal requiring multiple
   membrane rolls. Substrate preparation (grading, cleaning) adds 1-2 days per kilometre.
   No curing time is required — the canal can be filled immediately after installation.

6. **Que espessura de EPDM é recomendada para canais com velocidades de escoamento elevadas?**
   For canals with design flow velocity up to 1.5 m/s, 1.5 mm EPDM is standard. For velocities
   of 1.5-3.0 m/s, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM with increased anchor trench depth to 400 mm.
   For velocities above 3.0 m/s or in areas of hydraulic turbulence at structures (weirs, drop
   structures), a concrete or stone ballast layer over the EPDM is recommended to prevent
   hydraulic uplift.

7. **Como se trata a emenda do EPDM com estruturas de betão (comportas, passagens hidráulicas)?**
   At concrete structures — gates, culverts, cross-regulators — the EPDM membrane is taken up
   and bonded to the concrete face using EPDM contact adhesive and a mechanical termination bar.
   A bead of Lap Sealant covers the membrane edge and a stainless steel flashing is fixed over
   the termination. Pre-formed EPDM flanges and sleeves are used at all penetrations through
   the membrane for pipes, gate spindles and monitoring equipment.

8. **O EPDM de canal é o mesmo material que o EPDM de cobertura?**
   The base polymer is the same, but canal-grade EPDM is specified at thicknesses appropriate
   for hydraulic engineering applications (1.0-2.0 mm) and is supplied in roll widths up to
   15.25 m to minimise seam count on wide canals. It carries EN 13956 CE marking as a waterproofing
   sheet. The UV stability, chemical resistance and elongation are the same as for roofing-grade
   EPDM — the same polymer properties that make EPDM excellent for canal lining also make it
   excellent for roofing, and vice versa.
