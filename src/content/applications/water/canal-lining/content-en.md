# Canal Lining with EPDM Membrane

## Portugal's Canal Networks and the Water Loss Imperative

Water is the scarcest input in Portuguese agriculture, and nowhere is that scarcity more sharply
felt than in the gap between the water abstracted at the source and the water that actually
reaches the field. Across Portugal's hundreds of thousands of kilometres of secondary and
on-farm irrigation channels, the majority of water loss happens not in the field but in the
canal — seeping through unlined earth banks and beds or leaching through the cracked joints of
ageing concrete linings installed 40 or 50 years ago under different assumptions about water
availability.

The Alqueva Multi-Purpose Scheme — the centrepiece of southern Portuguese agricultural policy
since its completion in the early 2000s — stores 4,150 million cubic metres of water behind
Europe's largest man-made reservoir and distributes it through more than 1,400 kilometres of
primary canal infrastructure managed by EDIA (Empresa de Desenvolvimento e Infra-Estruturas
do Alqueva). The primary distribution network is engineered to a high standard. The secondary
and tertiary networks — the farm-level channels managed by water user associations and individual
farmers — are predominantly unlined earth or deteriorated concrete, losing between 20% and 50%
of conveyed water before it reaches the crop.

This is not an abstract inefficiency. At EDIA billing rates of €0.03 to €0.12 per cubic metre,
depending on use class and contract, seepage losses represent real and measurable operating cost
for every farmer served by these canals. The EU Water Framework Directive, which requires
Portugal to achieve good ecological status for water bodies by 2027, adds regulatory urgency
to what is already a compelling economic case.

Membriko, based in Pombal, provides the technically superior solution to this problem: EPDM
membrane canal lining that reduces seepage by 95 to 99%, achieves a service life of 50 or more
years, and can be installed over existing cracked concrete without demolition. This page explains
the technical case, the economic arithmetic, and the installation process — with the precision
and honesty that Membriko's clients expect.

## Why EPDM is the Right Material for Canal Lining

Canal lining presents a specific combination of demands that differs from pool lining, reservoir
lining, or roofing waterproofing. A canal lining system must simultaneously address:

- Differential settlement of the earthwork substrate — canal embankments consolidate, root
  systems penetrate foundations, and seasonal water table fluctuation changes the effective
  confining stress on the bank material
- Seasonal hydraulic loading cycles — fill and drain cycles that impose repeated tensile and
  compressive stresses on the lining
- Hydraulic shear forces from flowing water — which can dislodge or damage linings that are
  not adequately anchored or that have insufficient surface resistance
- Variable irrigation water chemistry — mineral fertiliser salts in fertigation water, copper
  sulphate fungicide residues, organophosphate pesticide residues, and occasional chlorination
  for algae control in distribution networks
- UV exposure on bank sections above the waterline — the freeboard zone and upper banks receive
  full Portuguese solar UV dose continuously throughout the service life
- Mechanical damage from maintenance equipment, fauna, and debris carried in the flow

EPDM addresses every one of these demands from a single material formulation. Membriko specifies
EPDM for canal lining not as a commercial preference but because no competing material solves
this combination of requirements with the same reliability and longevity.

### The Chemistry Behind the Performance

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic rubber elastomer whose polymer backbone
consists exclusively of saturated carbon-carbon single bonds. This saturated structure contains
no reactive double bonds that can be attacked by oxidising agents, ultraviolet radiation, or the
dissolved compounds present in irrigation water. The chemical resistance of EPDM is intrinsic —
it does not depend on protective coatings, sacrificial additives or surface treatments that
deplete over time.

The 400% elongation at break is the physical property that makes EPDM categorically superior
to concrete for canal lining in any location where the substrate is subject to movement. Concrete
cracks when the substrate deforms by more than a millimetre or two. EPDM stretches to
accommodate deformations measured in centimetres, then returns to its original dimensions when
the deformation reverses — repeatedly, over decades, without fatigue failure. This is not a
marginal advantage; it is the fundamental difference between a lining system with a 20-30 year
service life and one with 50+ years.

## Canal Types — Irrigation, Drainage and Ornamental

### Irrigation Canals

Agricultural irrigation is Membriko's primary market for canal lining. The application ranges
from large secondary distribution channels serving hundreds of hectares within organised
irrigation perimeters, down to individual farm-level earthen channels of a few hundred metres
serving a single crop block.

For irrigation canals, the technical priorities are seepage reduction (the primary objective
of lining), resistance to irrigation water chemistry, durability against root intrusion from
bank vegetation, and resistance to the burrowing fauna endemic to Portuguese watercourses.
Membriko specifies 1.5 mm EPDM for standard agricultural irrigation canal lining, with 2.0 mm
specified for canals with design flow velocity above 1.5 m/s or where mechanical damage risk
from maintenance equipment or fauna is elevated.

Membriko has assisted water user associations (Associações de Regantes) in preparing technical
documentation for PDR (Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural) and PT2030 subsidy applications for
canal lining as an irrigation water efficiency measure. Canal lining with EPDM qualifies as
an eligible agricultural water efficiency investment, with co-financing rates of up to 50% of
eligible costs for qualifying associations and agricultural businesses.

### Drainage Canals

Agricultural drainage channels serve the reverse function of irrigation channels: they remove
excess water from waterlogged fields to maintain root zone conditions for crop growth. Municipal
and road drainage channels convey surface runoff to rivers, retention basins or treatment
systems.

For agricultural drainage, the specific engineering concern is reverse hydraulic pressure —
groundwater attempting to enter the canal from below when the water table is higher than the
canal water level. Membriko addresses this with reinforced anchor trench details and, where
required, by specifying a drainage layer between the canal bed and the EPDM membrane to
relieve uplift pressure. For municipal drainage, 2.0 mm EPDM with a protective topping (gravel
or lightweight concrete) provides the combined impermeability and mechanical protection required
for channels subject to maintenance access and occasional high-velocity peak flows.

### Ornamental Canals and Water Features

Urban parkland watercourses, historic quinta garden water channels, golf course water features
and landscape water elements in commercial developments all share the requirement for a
permanent, watertight, low-maintenance lining that can be installed on irregular geometry
and complex profile. EPDM serves all these applications with the same technical performance
as agricultural canals, with the additional benefit that the smooth black surface creates
a clean, contemporary aesthetic that integrates well with both designed landscapes and
naturalistic settings.

Membriko installs EPDM in ornamental canals that may be left with the membrane visible —
for a modern, reflective water surface — or covered with rounded cobbles, washed gravel or
stone flags for a naturalistic appearance. The impermeability and service life are equivalent
in either case.

---

## Water Loss Prevention — The Seepage Arithmetic

The economic case for EPDM canal lining begins with seepage data. Membriko presents this data
transparently so that clients can make investment decisions based on their own canal dimensions,
local water tariffs and soil conditions — not on generic marketing claims.

### Seepage Loss by Canal Type

| Canal Type | Seepage Loss | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Unlined earth, sandy/alluvial soil | 40-60% of conveyed flow | Maximum loss; high permeability |
| Unlined earth, cohesive clay | 20-35% of conveyed flow | Clay provides partial self-sealing |
| Jointed concrete lining (new) | 5-15% | Loss concentrated at joints |
| Jointed concrete lining (15+ years) | 15-30% | Joint seal failure; thermal cracking |
| Monolithic concrete (new) | 3-8% | Loss through concrete porosity |
| Monolithic concrete (20+ years) | 10-25% | Progressive cracking |
| EPDM membrane lining (Membriko) | < 1% | Membrane impermeability |

### The Economic Calculation

For an irrigation canal delivering 0.3 m³/s over a 90-day irrigation season, in soil with 40%
seepage loss:

- Volume lost to seepage: 0.3 m³/s × 0.40 × 90 days × 86,400 s/day = 933,120 m³/km/year
- At an EDIA tariff of €0.06/m³: €55,987/km/year in water that pays for irrigation but
  never reaches the crop
- Membriko EPDM installation cost for 1.5 mm lining: approximately €18,000-€35,000/km installed
- Simple payback period: 0.3-0.6 years — less than one irrigation season

For smaller channels with lower flow rates, the payback extends to 3-8 years — still highly
favourable against a 50+ year service life and well within the financial horizon of an investment
supported by PDR agricultural grants.

Membriko prepares project-specific payback calculations using the client's actual canal
dimensions, measured or estimated flow rate, soil permeability data and applicable water tariff.
The analysis uses the client's own numbers — not generic industry averages.

### Concrete Canal Rehabilitation: The Most Common Case

The most frequent situation Membriko encounters in canal projects is a concrete-lined canal
built between 1940 and 1985 — now 40-80 years old, with thermal cracking, failed expansion
joints, and seepage losses of 15-30%. The owner or water user association faces a choice:
demolish the existing concrete and reconstruct (expensive, disruptive, slow, with a concrete
canal that will face the same problems in another 20-25 years), or install EPDM over the
existing concrete (cost-effective, fast, no curing delay, immediate performance improvement,
50+ years additional service life).

Membriko has prepared this analysis for numerous water user associations across Portugal.
In virtually every case, the EPDM overlay is the superior solution on both cost and performance
grounds. The concrete substrate, even when cracked, provides structural support for the membrane
and mechanical protection against damage — a combined system that outperforms either element alone.

---

## EPDM Canal Lining Installation: The Six-Stage Process

Membriko follows a structured installation process that scales from a 200-metre farm channel
to multi-kilometre infrastructure rehabilitation. Each stage has a specific technical purpose.

### Stage 1: Survey and Diagnosis

Membriko begins every canal project with a structured field survey. For canals of significant
length (above 500 metres), this includes:

- Topographic measurement of the canal alignment with cross-sections at regular intervals
  (base width, bank slope angle, depth, freeboard)
- Inventory and measurement of all hydraulic structures: intake gates, offtakes, overflow weirs,
  culverts, cross-regulators, drainage connections
- Assessment of the existing lining condition: crack width and pattern, joint opening, areas
  of delamination, exposed reinforcement
- Substrate assessment for earth canals: soil type and compaction, stone content, root density
  and depth, groundwater level
- Seepage quantification: comparison of flow measurements at successive gauging points along
  the canal, or visual observation of seep points on banks and bed

The survey result is a technical report that underpins the proposed solution. Membriko does not
provide canal lining quotations without first completing this assessment — the variables that
determine the correct specification and the realistic cost cannot be estimated without site data.

### Stage 2: Hydraulic Design

With survey data in hand, Membriko carries out the hydraulic design of the lined canal. The
design verification addresses:

- Confirmation that the reduction in canal cross-section introduced by the membrane thickness
  (1.0-2.0 mm) does not compromise design conveyance capacity
- Calculation of flow velocity in the lined canal using Manning's equation, confirming that
  velocity remains within the limits for the specified membrane thickness
- Verification that EPDM's lower hydraulic roughness (Manning's n 0.010-0.014 vs 0.022-0.030
  for earth) improves conveyance capacity relative to the existing lining condition
- Sizing of EPDM accessories at hydraulic structures for operating flows and pressures

The hydraulic design is documented in a calculation report that forms part of the project
technical dossier and can be submitted to DGADR (Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural
Development) for subsidy applications.

### Stage 3: Substrate Preparation

Substrate preparation quality directly determines the long-term performance of the lining.
Membriko treats this stage with the same technical rigour as the membrane installation.

For earth canals:
- Vegetation and debris clearance from the canal bed and banks
- Bed compaction using lightweight compaction equipment (where access permits) or hand tamping
- Profile grading to achieve regular straight bank faces without protruding stones, roots or
  angular irregularities that could create stress concentrations in the membrane
- Application of a 50 mm washed sand bedding layer on which the membrane rests; where sharp
  stone content is unavoidable, a non-woven protective geotextile is installed between the
  soil and the EPDM membrane

For concrete canals:
- High-pressure water jetting to remove biological fouling, scale deposits and irrigation
  water residues from the concrete surface
- Grinding of sharp edges and projecting aggregate or reinforcement that could concentrate
  stress in the membrane
- Filling of open cracks wider than 3 mm and failed expansion joints with flexible epoxy
  or polyurethane mortar — not to restore the concrete's impermeability (that function is
  transferred to the membrane) but to eliminate stress concentration points on the membrane's
  underside

### Stage 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Installation begins at the upstream end of the canal and proceeds downstream. Membriko works
with EPDM rolls of up to 15.25 m width and lengths that minimise the number of transverse
seams along the canal.

The EPDM is unrolled along the canal, formed to the cross-section profile (bed, banks and
berms), and anchored at the upper bank edges by one of the methods described below. For canals
wider than the available sheet width, adjacent rolls are overlapped by a minimum of 150 mm and
the longitudinal seam is bonded with 150 mm QuickSeam tape and QuickPrime Plus primer.

The membrane is installed with a slight surplus — not tensioned — so that it can accommodate
substrate movements without stress concentrations at seams or anchors. In earth canals, Membriko
specifies a surplus of 5-10% of the wetted perimeter. In concrete canals, a smaller surplus
is sufficient given the more stable substrate.

### Stage 5: Anchoring, Cross-Seams and Structure Interfaces

Edge anchoring is the most critical detail for long-term canal lining performance. An inadequately
anchored EPDM membrane will lift under hydraulic pressure, wind suction or asymmetric filling
loads, creating blisters that become stress concentration points and eventual failure locations.

The anchor trench method (standard for earth canal banks) buries the membrane edge 300 mm
deep in a 300 mm wide trench at the top of the bank, backfilled with compacted soil. The
mechanical anchor bar method (for concrete banks or structure interfaces) uses an aluminium
or stainless steel bar fixed with expanding stainless anchors at 300 mm centres, covered with
an EPDM cover strip and sealed with Lap Sealant.

At hydraulic structures — gates, culverts, offtakes, weirs, cross-regulators — Membriko
uses pre-formed EPDM flanges and sleeves for all penetrations, bonded to the main membrane
with QuickSeam. The membrane is taken up and mechanically anchored to concrete structure faces.

### Stage 6: Testing and Documentation

After installation completion, Membriko carries out a systematic visual inspection of all
seams, anchor zones and structure interfaces with photographic record. The canal is filled
gradually and Membriko supervises the first fill to verify membrane behaviour under progressive
hydraulic loading.

Project documentation delivered to the client includes:
- Survey report and hydraulic design calculations
- Before-and-after photographic record
- EPDM product certificates (EN 13956, technical data sheets, Declaration of Performance)
- Membriko installation guarantee certificate (15 years for canal installations)
- Technical documentation for PDR/PT2030 subsidy applications (where applicable)

## Canal Rehabilitation with EPDM

The rehabilitation of deteriorated concrete canals with EPDM membrane overlay is often the
highest-value canal work Membriko undertakes. It preserves structurally capable infrastructure,
eliminates the seepage that made it inefficient, and achieves this at a fraction of the cost
of demolition and reconstruction.

### What Membriko Can Line

**Cracked concrete in structurally sound condition:** provided the concrete is cohesive with
no widespread delamination and no exposed corroded reinforcement, Membriko installs EPDM over
the existing cracked concrete. The membrane's 400% elongation bridges existing cracks and
provides a new continuous impermeable layer. The concrete provides structural support and
mechanical protection. The combined system delivers 50+ years of additional service.

**Jointed concrete with failed expansion joints:** open expansion joints are filled with
levelling mortar to eliminate the steps and grooves that would create stress concentrations
in the EPDM. After levelling, the process is identical to cracked monolithic concrete.

**Deteriorated earth canal:** where the original earth canal has degraded with eroded banks
and irregular profile, the banks are regraded and compacted before EPDM installation. Profile
correction simultaneously improves hydraulic efficiency.

### What Requires Prior Intervention

Membriko is direct about the conditions that complicate or preclude EPDM overlay:

- **Active concrete delamination or severely corroded exposed reinforcement:** delaminated zones
  must be removed and patched before membrane installation. The membrane cannot perform reliably
  over concrete that continues to deteriorate beneath it.
- **Upward groundwater pressure through the canal bed:** where the groundwater table is
  consistently higher than the canal water level (common in low-lying areas with high water
  tables), the membrane is subject to uplift pressure from below. Membriko addresses this
  with a drainage layer and geocomposite vent layer beneath the membrane, or specifies
  2.0 mm EPDM with reinforced anchorage.
- **Active biological contamination:** dense algae and biofilm must be treated with sodium
  hypochlorite solution and removed before installation. EPDM adhesive does not bond to
  biologically contaminated surfaces.

## EPDM vs Concrete, HDPE and Clay: An Honest Comparison

Membriko presents this comparison in good faith. There are circumstances where concrete, HDPE
or clay are the correct specification. Our objective is that clients choose on the basis of
accurate technical data.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | New Concrete | HDPE Geomembrane | Compacted Clay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Seepage reduction | 95-99% | 80-92% new; 60-80% at 15 years | 95-99% | 70-85% wet; 10-30% dry |
| Lining service life | 50+ years | 20-30 years (cracks) | 30-50 years | Permanent (if maintained) |
| Cold temperature limit | -45°C (remains flexible) | Brittle below -10°C | Brittle below -15°C | Destroyed by freeze-thaw |
| Joint / seam integrity | Continuous bonded seam | Expansion joint every 5-8 m | Hot-wedge welded seam | No seams |
| Installation speed | Fast — no curing delay | Slow — formwork, curing | Fast | Moderate — compaction required |
| Substrate tolerance | 400% elongation; installs over cracks | Cannot bridge cracks | 600% elongation; stiffer | Conforms to substrate |
| Rehabilitation overlay | Yes — over concrete or earth | No — demolition required | Yes | Not practical over concrete |
| Manning's n (roughness) | 0.010-0.014 | 0.012-0.016 | 0.009-0.012 | 0.022-0.030 |
| 30-year lifecycle cost | Low | High (crack repair + reconstruction) | Comparable to EPDM | Low (if materials available) |

Honest note on HDPE: HDPE geomembrane is technically comparable to EPDM in many canal
applications. In large civil engineering procurement, HDPE is often specified because it fits
established geomembrane procurement frameworks. The hot-wedge welding process for HDPE seams
requires specialised equipment sensitive to ambient temperature and humidity; EPDM's QuickSeam
tape system is faster, requires no specialised equipment, and can be executed at lower ambient
temperatures. For Portuguese agricultural and minor civil canal lining — Membriko's primary
market — EPDM's field-friendly seaming and superior cold-temperature performance make it
the more practical specification in most situations.

Honest note on clay: where suitable clay materials are locally available at low cost and where
design flow velocity is below 0.5 m/s, compacted clay lining can be economically viable for
minor irrigation channels. Membriko does not argue against clay where it is genuinely appropriate.
Clay is destroyed by freeze-thaw cycling, cannot resist velocities above 0.5 m/s without erosion,
and is vulnerable to burrowing fauna — limitations that do not apply to EPDM.

---

## Flow Hydraulics and the EPDM Surface

The hydraulic efficiency argument for EPDM canal lining is one of the most underappreciated
dimensions of the material's value, and one that Membriko presents to every engineering client
as part of the technical case.

### Manning's Equation and Surface Roughness

Open channel flow is described by Manning's equation:

**Q = (1/n) × A × R^(2/3) × S^(1/2)**

Where Q is discharge, n is Manning's roughness coefficient, A is cross-sectional area, R is
hydraulic radius, and S is channel slope. A lower value of n means a smoother surface and
higher flow velocity for the same channel geometry and slope — directly translating to greater
conveyance capacity.

### Manning's n Values by Surface Type

| Surface Type | Manning's n | Relative Flow Velocity |
|---|---|---|
| Unlined earth (clean, straight) | 0.022-0.030 | 100% (reference) |
| Unlined earth (weeds, irregular) | 0.030-0.050 | 60-80% |
| In-situ concrete, good finish | 0.012-0.016 | 155-185% |
| Prefab concrete panels with joints | 0.014-0.018 | 130-165% |
| EPDM membrane (smooth) | 0.010-0.014 | 165-215% |
| HDPE geomembrane (smooth) | 0.009-0.012 | 185-230% |

### The Capacity Dividend

For a trapezoidal canal of 0.5 m base width, 1.0 m water depth, 1:1.5 bank slopes and 0.1%
slope, the transition from earth lining (n = 0.025) to EPDM lining (n = 0.012) increases flow
velocity from approximately 0.47 m/s to 0.98 m/s — a 109% increase. The conveyance capacity
(discharge) increases proportionally.

For a water user association whose primary distribution canal is operating near its hydraulic
capacity limit, this increase means that the existing canal cross-section can deliver twice as
much water after EPDM lining — without any widening or deepening. For a designer sizing a new
canal, EPDM lining allows a 30% reduction in cross-section for the same design discharge,
reducing earthwork volumes and installation cost.

This hydraulic capacity dividend is rarely factored into simple seepage-based payback
calculations, but it represents genuine and measurable added value in capacity-constrained
irrigation systems.

---

## Anchoring Systems and Edge Details

The durability of an EPDM canal lining is determined as much by the quality of the edge detail
as by the membrane itself. Membriko treats anchoring as precision engineering work, not routine
procedure.

### Anchor Trench Method (Standard for Earth Canal Banks)

The anchor trench is Membriko's standard edge detail for EPDM canal lining in earth:

1. The membrane edge is extended to the top of the canal bank, with 600 mm surplus beyond the
   design freeboard level
2. The surplus is folded back on itself, creating a 300 mm double layer
3. The folded edge is inserted into a trench of 300 mm depth and 300 mm width cut at the top
   of the bank
4. The trench is backfilled with compacted soil in 100 mm lifts
5. In sandy or erosion-prone soils, the trench backfill is a lean concrete mix to ensure uplift
   resistance even in saturated conditions

This anchor trench resists uplift forces of at least 2-3 kN/m of bank width — sufficient for
all normal hydraulic loading conditions in Portuguese agricultural canals.

### Mechanical Anchor Bar (Concrete Banks and Structure Interfaces)

Where the bank is concrete or where the membrane terminates against a concrete structure:

1. The membrane extends over the top of the bank or structure face with 150 mm surplus beyond
   the anchor point
2. An anodised aluminium or stainless steel anchor bar is fixed to the concrete with stainless
   expanding anchors at 300 mm centres, compressing the membrane edge against the concrete
3. A 150 mm EPDM cover strip is bonded with QuickSeam over the fixing points and membrane edge
   to maintain waterproofing continuity
4. A bead of Lap Sealant is applied over the upper edge of the membrane to protect the cut
   edge from stress-induced delamination
5. A stainless steel drip flashing is fixed above the anchor bar to direct surface water runoff
   away from the bonded membrane edge

### Freeboard Zone and UV Exposure

Membriko specifies that the membrane extends a minimum of 300 mm above the design water level —
500 mm in canals subject to uncontrolled flood events. This freeboard zone is continuously
UV-exposed, alternating between wet and dry with each water level change. EPDM's intrinsic
UV stability (saturated polymer backbone, carbon black as primary UV absorber) ensures that
the freeboard zone performs identically to the submerged section — no additional UV protection
is required and no different material is needed above the waterline.

## Maintaining EPDM Canal Linings

One of EPDM's most practically significant advantages over concrete canal lining is the
substantially lower ongoing maintenance requirement. Membriko presents this advantage honestly:
EPDM-lined canals are not maintenance-free, but the maintenance they require is a fraction of
what concrete demands.

### Annual Inspection

Membriko recommends a structured visual inspection at the start of each irrigation season,
focused on:

- Anchor trench zones: verify that trench backfill has not eroded or settled, exposing the
  membrane edge or relaxing anchor resistance; verify that mechanical anchor bars remain
  securely fixed and that cover strips are intact
- Structure interfaces: verify the condition of membrane-to-concrete bonds at gates, offtakes,
  culverts and cross-regulators; verify the integrity of pre-formed EPDM flanges at all
  penetrations; check Lap Sealant condition
- UV-exposed freeboard zone: verify the section of membrane above the waterline; no degradation
  is expected in this zone, but mechanical damage from maintenance equipment or animal activity
  should be identified and repaired early

### Biological Management

EPDM's smooth surface resists colonisation by rooted aquatic vegetation more effectively than
rough concrete or earth. In canals with slow-moving, nutrient-rich water (common in fertigation
distribution networks), a film of filamentous algae may develop on the membrane surface. This
film does not damage the EPDM — there is no chemical or biological attack mechanism of algae
on vulcanised EPDM elastomer — but it can marginally increase hydraulic roughness. Periodic
mechanical cleaning with brushes or water jetting is effective and poses no risk to the membrane.
EPDM is resistant to the algaecides and herbicides used for canal weed control at standard
application rates.

### Fauna Damage

Burrowing semi-aquatic rodents — water voles (Arvicola sapidus) and coypu (Myocastor coypus)
— are present throughout Portuguese watercourse systems and can penetrate EPDM membranes by
digging through canal banks. Where this risk is assessed as significant, Membriko recommends:

- 2.0 mm EPDM (greater puncture resistance than 1.0-1.5 mm)
- Non-woven geotextile protective underlay (fleece) between soil and membrane
- Physical protection of the bank zone with 50 mm gravel or lightweight concrete over the membrane

### Repair

Localised membrane damage is repaired with an EPDM patch of the same thickness:

1. The canal section is dewatered (or isolated with stop planks)
2. The damaged area is cleaned with solvent and dried
3. An EPDM patch extending at least 100 mm beyond the damage in all directions is bonded
   with QuickSeam over the damaged point
4. The canal is refilled after a 24-hour adhesive cure period

Large-scale damage or membrane degradation over an extended section requires re-lining of
the affected reach. Membriko carries out repairs under the installation guarantee and provides
a revised guarantee certificate after completing repair work.

## Portuguese Water Infrastructure: Alqueva, EFMA and the National Framework

Membriko operates within and understands the institutional landscape of Portuguese water
management. This section provides context for clients in the organised irrigation sector.

### The Alqueva Scheme and EFMA

The Alqueva Multi-Purpose Scheme is the most significant water infrastructure investment in
Portuguese history. EDIA manages the primary distribution network directly at professional
standards. The secondary and tertiary farm-level networks — managed by Beneficiary Associations
and individual farmers within the 120,000+ hectare irrigation perimeter — include tens of
thousands of kilometres of unlined and deteriorated concrete channels.

This secondary and tertiary Alqueva network represents the largest single market opportunity
for EPDM canal lining in Portugal. Membriko has the technical capacity and logistical reach
to serve Beneficiary Associations of any size throughout the Alentejo, operating from Pombal
with regional support across southern Portugal.

### The Ribatejo and 1940s-1960s Concrete Infrastructure

The Lower Tagus and Tejo-Sorraia hydroagricultural schemes include concrete-lined canal
infrastructure constructed between 1940 and 1965 — now 60-85 years old and requiring major
rehabilitation. The Canal de Alpiarça and associated distribution infrastructure of the
Ribatejo perimeter exemplify this challenge: structurally viable concrete, comprehensively
cracked and leaking, maintaining only 60-75% of its original hydraulic efficiency.

EPDM overlay over this infrastructure is technically straightforward, can be executed during
the low-demand winter period without disrupting the irrigation season, and transforms ageing
infrastructure into a system with 50+ years of additional service life at a cost well below
concrete demolition and reconstruction.

### Funding Framework

Canal lining with EPDM is eligible for support under several Portuguese and European funding
instruments:

**PDR / PT2030 (Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural):** agricultural water efficiency measures
are eligible for co-financing at up to 50% of eligible investment costs for qualifying farmers
and water user associations. Membriko provides the technical documentation required for
application dossiers: hydraulic calculation report, EN 13956 Declaration of Performance,
product technical data sheets and seepage reduction data.

**POSEUR / Portugal 2020 successors:** collective and public irrigation infrastructure
rehabilitation programmes have co-financed canal rehabilitation works at the irrigation
perimeter level.

Membriko does not manage subsidy applications on behalf of clients but collaborates actively
in technical documentation preparation and can recommend experienced agricultural subsidy
consultants.

## Environmental Considerations

Canal lining with EPDM delivers environmental benefits that extend beyond the direct
water efficiency improvement. These benefits are increasingly relevant in planning and
environmental impact assessment processes and in the context of agricultural sustainability
certifications.

### Water Conservation as Environmental Stewardship

Every cubic metre not lost to canal seepage is a cubic metre that remains available in the
catchment: it maintains base flows in rivers and streams that support aquatic biodiversity,
contributes to groundwater recharge under controlled conditions, and reduces pressure on
aquifer systems that are already over-exploited in southern Portugal. The EU Water Framework
Directive's requirement for good ecological status in water bodies by 2027 creates specific
obligations around agricultural water management that canal lining directly addresses.

### Chemical Inertness of EPDM in Irrigation Water Contact

EPDM releases no plasticisers, biocides, heavy metals or organic compounds into the irrigation
water flowing over it. This inertness is material for several reasons. Irrigation water used
for fresh vegetable and fruit production is subject to EU maximum residue level regulation
(Regulation EU 2023/915). Membriko can provide technical documentation confirming zero
migration of compounds from EPDM into contact water.

### Service Life and Embodied Carbon

The lifecycle environmental profile of EPDM canal lining compares favourably with concrete:

- At 1.5 mm, EPDM weighs approximately 1.8 kg/m² versus 150-200 kg/m² for 80 mm in-situ
  concrete lining — substantially lower embodied carbon per unit area installed
- The 50+ year service life avoids the full reconstruction cycle that concrete requires at
  20-30 years, further improving the lifecycle carbon comparison
- EPDM is recyclable as crumb rubber at end of service life, with established recycling
  pathways in Portugal for vulcanised rubber materials

### Biodiversity Considerations

Smooth EPDM canal lining reduces the crevice habitat value of canal margins for reptiles and
small mammals compared with rough concrete surfaces. Where environmental impact assessment
requires ecological mitigation, Membriko can incorporate structured bank profiles — stone
ballast sections, rough aggregate zones or specific profile geometries — at intervals that
maintain hydraulic efficiency while providing habitat features required by the environmental
management plan.

## Frequently Asked Questions on EPDM Canal Lining

**Is EPDM canal lining eligible for PDR / FEADER water efficiency grants?**

Yes. Canal lining to reduce seepage losses qualifies as an irrigation water efficiency measure
under the PDR (Rural Development Programme) and FEADER agricultural infrastructure funding.
Membriko provides complete technical documentation for application dossiers — hydraulic
calculation reports, EN 13956 Declaration of Performance, product data sheets and seepage
reduction data verified against published FAO and ICID benchmarks. Water user associations
planning applications should engage Membriko sufficiently in advance to ensure technical
documentation is available before submission deadlines.

**What is the maximum canal width that can be lined without floor seams?**

EPDM is available in single-sheet widths of up to 15.25 metres. For a trapezoidal canal of
3 m base width and 1:1.5 bank slopes to 1.5 m water depth, the total wetted profile perimeter
is approximately 8.4 m — within a single sheet width. Canals with wider profiles require
longitudinal seams bonded with QuickSeam tape. Membriko designs seam layouts to minimise seam
count and to position longitudinal seams above the canal invert where hydraulic stresses are
least.

**Can EPDM be installed over cracked concrete without demolition?**

Yes. Overlay of EPDM over existing cracked concrete is one of Membriko's most common canal
rehabilitation techniques. The 400% elongation of the EPDM membrane bridges existing cracks
and provides a new continuous impermeable layer, while the concrete substrate provides
structural support and mechanical protection for the membrane. The concrete must be structurally
cohesive with no widespread delamination, and the canal bed must be free of persistent upward
groundwater infiltration.

**Is EPDM compatible with irrigation water containing agrochemicals and fertilisers?**

Yes. EPDM's saturated polymer backbone is chemically inert to the full range of compounds
present in typical agricultural irrigation water: mineral fertiliser salts in fertigation
solutions, organophosphate and carbamate pesticide residues, copper sulphate fungicide solutions,
and the low concentrations of chlorine sometimes used for algae control in irrigation
distribution networks. Membriko can provide chemical resistance data for specific compounds
where irrigation water chemistry is unusual or where regulatory confirmation is required.

**How long does it take to install one kilometre of irrigation canal?**

A Membriko team of four to five trained operatives installs approximately 200-400 linear metres
per working day on a prepared substrate. One kilometre of canal of 1-2 metre width takes
approximately 3-5 installation working days. Substrate preparation (grading, cleaning, crack
filling) adds 1-2 days per kilometre. No curing time is required after installation — the canal
can be filled immediately after the installation team completes the work.

**What membrane thickness is recommended for canals with high flow velocity?**

For canals with design flow velocity up to 1.5 m/s, Membriko specifies 1.5 mm EPDM with
standard anchor trench details. For velocities of 1.5-3.0 m/s, 2.0 mm EPDM is specified
with reinforced anchor trenches (400 mm depth) or mechanical anchor bars at 200 mm centres.
For velocities above 3.0 m/s or in zones of hydraulic turbulence at structures (weirs,
drop structures, offtake gates), a protective topping of 100 mm gravel or 50 mm lightweight
concrete is applied over the membrane to prevent hydraulic uplift.

**How is the EPDM membrane joined to existing concrete structures?**

At concrete structures — gates, culverts, cross-regulators, offtake headworks — the EPDM
membrane is taken up and bonded to the concrete face using EPDM contact adhesive, then
mechanically anchored with a stainless or aluminium anchor bar. A bead of Lap Sealant covers
the membrane edge and a stainless drip flashing is fixed above the anchor bar. All penetrations
through the membrane for pipes, gate spindles or monitoring equipment receive pre-formed EPDM
flanges bonded with QuickSeam, creating continuous watertight transitions between the flat
membrane and cylindrical penetrating elements.

**Is canal-grade EPDM the same material as roofing-grade EPDM?**

The base polymer chemistry is identical — the same vulcanised EPDM elastomer with the same
saturated backbone, UV stability, chemical resistance and elongation. The differences are in
specification and product format: canal-grade EPDM is supplied in thicknesses of 1.0-2.0 mm
appropriate for hydraulic engineering (versus 1.0-1.5 mm typical for many roofing applications),
in roll widths up to 15.25 m to minimise seam frequency on wide canals, and with CE marking
under EN 13956 as a waterproofing sheet for geotechnical and hydraulic applications. Membriko
specifies only product certified to the dimensions and standards required for each project.
