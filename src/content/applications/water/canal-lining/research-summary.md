# Canal Lining (Revestimento de Canais) — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Canal Lining: The Core Case

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is the material of choice for permanent canal lining
because its combination of chemical inertness, elastomeric flexibility and UV stability addresses
every failure mode of competing lining systems simultaneously. Canals impose a specific set of
demands that differ meaningfully from pool or reservoir lining: the substrate is typically
excavated earth or aged concrete subject to differential settlement; flow conditions create
hydraulic shear forces on the lining surface; the water is often untreated and carries suspended
sediment; and the lining must function unattended for decades with minimal inspection.

EPDM's saturated carbon-carbon backbone provides chemical inertness to the full range of
irrigation water chemistry — mineral salts, dissolved organics, phytosanitary residues, and
the chlorinated compounds sometimes used in irrigation water treatment. The absence of reactive
double bonds in the main polymer chain means there is no degradation pathway via oxidative
attack, which is the primary failure mechanism of natural rubber and unsaturated synthetic rubbers
in outdoor water contact applications.

Physical properties relevant to canal lining:
- Tensile strength: 9-12 N/mm² (sufficient to resist hydraulic pressure and handling stresses
  during installation on long runs)
- Elongation at break: 400-500% (critical for accommodation of substrate deformation; canal
  earthworks are subject to differential settlement, frost heave and root intrusion that would
  crack rigid linings)
- Tear resistance: ≥ 20 N/mm (resistance to propagation of localised punctures caused by stone
  inclusions or installation stress concentrations)
- UV resistance: no degradation at 2,000 hours xenon arc per EN ISO 4892-3; relevant because
  canal lining above the waterline — including the upper bank sections and freeboard zone — is
  continuously UV-exposed
- Service temperature: -45°C to +130°C (covers the full Portuguese climatic range from Trás-os-
  Montes winter to Alentejo summer; canal linings in southern Portugal experience surface
  temperatures above 60°C when dry and exposed in summer)

Thickness grades for canal applications:
- 1.0 mm: light-duty agricultural irrigation channels; low flow velocity; protected from foot
  traffic
- 1.5 mm: standard irrigation and drainage canal lining; principal agricultural and civil
  engineering specification
- 2.0 mm: heavy-duty canals subject to significant hydraulic loading, water velocity above
  1.5 m/s, or potential mechanical damage from debris, tools or maintenance access

## Water Conveyance Efficiency: The Seepage Data

Seepage from unlined canals is the primary water loss mechanism in irrigation infrastructure
worldwide. Published data from ICID (International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage) and
FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) establishes the following seepage
loss ranges by canal type:

- Unlined earth canal in permeable alluvial soils: 30-50% of conveyed flow lost per unit
  distance. In sandy soils, losses can exceed 50%.
- Unlined earth canal in cohesive clay soils: 15-25% loss per unit distance. Clay provides
  natural partial sealing, particularly when saturated.
- Lined canal with jointed concrete sections (prefabricated panels or in-situ cast with
  expansion joints at 5-8 m): 5-15% loss per unit distance, primarily through joint failures
  after the first thermal cycle series
- Lined canal with monolithic concrete (in-situ, continuously reinforced): 3-8% loss, with
  losses increasing as cracking develops over time due to thermal and settlement cycling
- Canal lined with EPDM membrane (correctly installed): < 1% residual seepage, representing
  water that passes through the membrane body (intrinsic permeability) and through properly
  made seams (which approach zero for QuickSeam-bonded EPDM). Practical field experience
  consistently reports 95-99% reduction in losses versus the unlined baseline.

For Portuguese irrigation agriculture, these efficiency numbers translate directly to financial
value. The EDIA (Empresa de Desenvolvimento e Infra-Estruturas do Alqueva) bills water at
tariffs of approximately €0.03-0.12 per cubic metre depending on use class and contract.
For a canal delivering 0.5 m³/s (a moderate agricultural canal) over a 10-hour daily irrigation
period, 40% seepage loss represents approximately 72,000 litres/day of water lost — at €0.06/m³,
this is €4.32/day per kilometre of canal, or approximately €430/year per kilometre for a 100-day
irrigation season. An EPDM lining that eliminates 95% of these losses pays back its installation
cost within 3-8 years depending on local water tariffs and soil permeability.

## Portuguese Irrigation Infrastructure: Context and Scale

Portugal's irrigation infrastructure is among the most extensive in the Iberian Peninsula,
driven by the combination of a continental climate with dry summers in the interior regions and
a long tradition of organised irrigation (regadio) dating to the Roman period and the Moorish
hydraulic tradition in the south.

Key irrigation infrastructure elements:

**EFMA (Empreendimento de Fins Múltiplos do Alqueva)**
The Alqueva multi-purpose scheme is the largest man-made reservoir in Western Europe and the
centrepiece of Portuguese agricultural development in the Alentejo. The dam, completed in 2002
with full reservoir capacity reached by 2010, stores approximately 4,150 million m³ and serves
an irrigation perimeter that extends over 120,000 hectares in the districts of Beja, Évora and
Setúbal. The primary distribution network includes over 1,400 km of canals, pipes and channels.
Secondary and tertiary distribution extends to individual farm properties through a further
2,000+ km of infrastructure, much of it managed by individual water user associations (EDIA,
2023).

The internal on-farm canal network — secondary and tertiary earthen channels serving individual
farm blocks — runs to hundreds of thousands of kilometres nationally and is almost entirely
unlined, representing the largest potential market for EPDM canal lining in Portugal.

**ARBVR (Aproveitamento Regional de Baixo Vale do Ribatejo)**
The Ribatejo irrigation perimeter in the Tejo valley is one of the oldest organised irrigation
zones in Portugal, with infrastructure dating to the 1930s and 1940s under the Estado Novo
agricultural policy. The concrete-lined canals of this system are now 70-90 years old and
in a state of advanced deterioration. Rehabilitation with EPDM membrane over existing cracked
concrete is technically appropriate and economically superior to concrete reconstruction.

**AMDE (Aproveitamento do Mira e Derivação para o Escoamento)**
The Odemira-based scheme serving the intensive horticulture of the western Alentejo Litoral,
including the greenhouse clusters at Vila Nova de Milfontes and the open-field vegetable
production of the Alentejo coast. Water is transported in both pressurised pipes and open
channels. Channel lining with EPDM is appropriate for the open-channel sections.

**Minor irrigation associations (Associações de Regantes)**
Portugal has over 350 registered irrigation associations (Associações de Regantes e Beneficiários,
ARBs) managing local-scale irrigation infrastructure. These associations have primary
responsibility for the secondary and tertiary canal networks within their perimeters and are
the principal decision-making bodies for canal rehabilitation investments.

## EPDM vs Concrete for Canal Lining

Concrete is the traditional canal lining material, and the comparison between EPDM and concrete
for canal rehabilitation is the most important technical argument in the Portuguese market.

**Concrete canal lining: failure mechanisms**

Concrete in canals fails primarily through three mechanisms:

1. Thermal cracking: Portugal's irrigation canals are filled seasonally (typically April-September
   in the Alentejo). The annual thermal cycle from winter desiccation to summer water fill
   introduces shrinkage and thermal stresses. In-situ concrete cracks at expansion joints and
   develops random shrinkage cracks within panels over 5-15 years.

2. Settlement cracking: canal embankments are compacted fill subject to differential settlement
   as vegetation root systems penetrate the foundation, water table fluctuates, and occasional
   heavy rainfall saturates the bank material. Differential settlement of 10-20 mm is sufficient
   to crack rigid concrete panels.

3. Alkali-silica reaction (ASR): in concrete using reactive aggregates (common in Portuguese
   granitic and schist regions), moisture-driven ASR causes characteristic "map cracking" over
   20-40 years, progressively destroying the concrete's impermeability.

Once cracked, concrete canal linings typically lose 15-40% of conveyed flow through the crack
network — only marginally better than unlined earth. The common maintenance response is to
caulk visible cracks with bituminous or polyurethane sealant, which provides temporary relief
(2-5 years) but does not address the underlying thermal and structural movement that creates
new cracks.

**EPDM advantage over concrete:**
- Installation speed: a team of 4-5 workers can line 200-400 linear metres of standard canal
  per day with EPDM; comparable concrete work requires formwork, curing time, and typically
  achieves 50-100 m/day
- Seismic and settlement tolerance: 400% elongation vs 0% for concrete; EPDM accommodates
  substrate deformation without cracking
- No joints: EPDM seams are fewer than concrete expansion joints and are sealed as a continuous
  system; concrete linings have joints every 5-8 m, each a potential leakage point
- Service life: 50+ years for EPDM; 20-30 years for new concrete in aggressive conditions;
  cracked existing concrete has already exceeded its design life
- Lightweight: EPDM 1.5 mm weighs approximately 1.8 kg/m²; in-situ concrete at 80 mm
  weighs 192 kg/m²; the weight difference reduces foundation loading on canal embankments

## EPDM vs HDPE for Canal Lining

HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) geomembranes are the principal competitor to EPDM in
heavy civil engineering canal lining applications. The comparison is relevant because HDPE is
widely specified in larger dam and reservoir projects where procurement is through international
tender.

**HDPE geomembrane properties:**
- Thickness: typically 1.0-2.5 mm for canal applications
- Tensile strength: 15-25 N/mm² (higher than EPDM at equivalent thickness)
- Elongation at break: 600-900% (higher than EPDM; however, this property is rarely the
  limiting factor in canal applications where deformations are measured in millimetres)
- UV resistance: requires carbon black or UV stabiliser additives; exposed HDPE without
  adequate carbon black loading degrades significantly within 5-10 years of UV exposure
- Temperature performance: embrittlement at temperatures below -10°C to -15°C; this limits
  HDPE in applications where freeze-thaw cycling is expected (relevant in northern and
  interior Portuguese canals)
- Seaming: HDPE requires hot-wedge or extrusion welding; equipment is specialised, expensive
  and sensitive to environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, wind)

**EPDM advantages over HDPE for canal lining:**
- Cold temperature flexibility: EPDM remains flexible to -45°C; no brittle failure risk at
  any Portuguese ambient temperature
- Seaming system: EPDM seams with QuickSeam tape and primer are faster, require no specialised
  welding equipment, and can be performed at lower ambient temperatures
- Conformance to irregular surfaces: EPDM's lower modulus makes it more forgiving on irregular
  earthwork surfaces; HDPE's higher stiffness means it bridges over surface irregularities
  rather than conforming to them, creating differential stress concentrations
- Repair: EPDM punctures and tears can be repaired with patch and adhesive by a trained
  operative without specialised equipment; HDPE repair requires extrusion welding

**HDPE advantages over EPDM:**
- Higher tensile strength: relevant in applications with very high hydraulic head
- Wider sheet widths available from some manufacturers (up to 7-8 m single sheet, though EPDM
  is available in up to 15.25 m single sheet)
- Established procurement framework in large-scale civil engineering projects

For agricultural and minor civil canal lining in Portugal — the primary market for Membriko —
EPDM's combination of cold flexibility, field-friendly seaming and long service history makes
it the appropriate specification in most situations.

## EPDM vs Clay Lining

Compacted clay (bentonite or local clay) has been used for canal lining since antiquity and
remains relevant in Portuguese agricultural practice in regions with suitable clay soils.

Clay lining characteristics:
- When wet and intact: good to excellent impermeability (hydraulic conductivity 10⁻⁹ to 10⁻¹⁰ m/s)
- When dry and cracked (as occurs between irrigation seasons): hydraulic conductivity increases
  by 2-4 orders of magnitude until re-saturation occurs
- Susceptibility to piping (internal erosion) at high flow velocities; canal flow velocity should
  be kept below 0.5 m/s in unprotected clay to prevent erosion
- Unavailability: suitable clay materials are not universally available; transport costs from
  remote clay sources can make clay lining uneconomical
- Animal disturbance: burrowing animals (mole-rats, which are widespread in Portugal) destroy
  clay linings by tunnelling through the compacted layer

EPDM addresses all these clay limitations: maintains impermeability when dry, resists flow
velocities up to 3-4 m/s (in conjunction with appropriate channel design), can be transported
to any location, and resists mechanical disturbance from most sources.

## Hydraulic Performance: Manning's n and Flow Efficiency

Canal hydraulics are governed by Manning's equation for open channel flow, which relates
flow velocity to channel geometry, slope and surface roughness through the Manning roughness
coefficient (n). A lower value of n indicates a smoother surface and higher flow velocity
for a given channel cross-section and slope — which translates to either higher canal capacity
or the ability to achieve design flow rates with reduced channel cross-section (lower
construction cost).

Manning's n values for common canal surfaces:
- Unlined earth canal (clean, straight): n = 0.022-0.030
- Unlined earth canal (weeds, irregular): n = 0.030-0.050
- In-situ concrete, good finish: n = 0.012-0.016
- Prefabricated concrete panels with joints: n = 0.014-0.018
- EPDM membrane (smooth): n = 0.010-0.014
- HDPE geomembrane (smooth): n = 0.009-0.012

EPDM provides hydraulic roughness broadly comparable to smooth concrete and superior to earth
or vegetated surfaces. In practice, for a trapezoidal canal of 0.5 m base width, 1.0 m water
depth, and 0.001 (0.1%) slope, the transition from earth (n=0.025) to EPDM (n=0.012) increases
flow velocity by approximately 52% and discharge capacity by the same proportion — meaning the
existing canal cross-section can deliver significantly more water without any widening or
deepening, simply through lining.

This hydraulic efficiency dividend is rarely accounted for in simple payback calculations but
represents real value in irrigation systems where the primary canal is capacity-constrained.
