# Fish Ponds / Tanques de Aquacultura — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM in Aquaculture: Core Chemistry and Relevance

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is the predominant geomembrane liner material for
aquaculture ponds globally because it satisfies the single most demanding requirement of any fish
or shrimp culture system: biological neutrality. Unlike HDPE, PVC, and concrete-based liners,
EPDM releases no leachable compounds that are toxic to aquatic organisms at ambient water
temperatures. This is not an industry claim — it is a consequence of the polymer's molecular
architecture.

The saturated carbon-carbon backbone of EPDM is chemically inert in freshwater, brackish water,
and controlled saline environments. The vulcanisation cross-links are sulphur bridges at pendant
diene sites — stable, non-hydrolysable, and below detectable migration thresholds in standard
fish toxicity bioassay conditions (OECD 203, 210, 215). The carbon black filler (30-40 phr) is
insoluble in water and biologically inert. No plasticisers are present in vulcanised EPDM — a
critical distinction from PVC, which contains 20-40% phthalate or non-phthalate plasticisers by
mass that progressively migrate into pond water.

Key physical properties of aquaculture-grade EPDM:
- Service temperature range: -45°C to +130°C (continuous immersion, including geothermally
  heated ponds); peak resistance to +150°C
- Elongation at break: 350-500% (typical production grade)
- Tensile strength: 9-12 N/mm² depending on formulation
- Water absorption: < 1% by weight (ASTM D471)
- Hardness: 55-70 Shore A
- Recommended thickness for aquaculture: 0.75 mm (small ornamental), 1.0 mm (standard
  recreational), 1.5 mm (commercial fish production), 2.0 mm (heavy-duty or substrate-loaded
  ponds)

## Fish Safety: Toxicological Evidence

The toxicological safety of EPDM in aquaculture has been established through both formal
regulatory testing and decades of commercial aquaculture deployment.

**WRAS (Water Regulations Advisory Scheme) — United Kingdom**
WRAS approval under BS 6920 evaluates materials in contact with potable water for odour, taste,
appearance change, and extraction of metals and organic compounds. WRAS-approved EPDM geomembrane
formulations have passed extraction testing for all regulated compounds. The same extraction
conditions (elevated temperature, extended contact time) are conservative relative to ambient
temperature fish pond conditions.

**ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire) — France**
The French ACS certification for water contact materials requires migration testing for sulphur
vulcanisation residues, zinc (from ZnO accelerator activator), antioxidants, and carbon black
extractables. ACS-certified EPDM formulations have demonstrated migration below the limits
specified in the Arrêté du 29 mai 1997. Given that aquaculture regulations in the EU are in
practice more demanding than potable water contact standards for construction materials, ACS
certification provides strong assurance for aquaculture use.

**NSF/ANSI 61**
NSF International's Standard 61 (drinking water system components) certification is held by
several EPDM geomembrane manufacturers. Membranes meeting NSF 61 are widely used in potable
water reservoirs, fish hatcheries, and commercial aquaculture ponds across North America and
internationally. This standard specifically tests for contaminant migration at concentrations
relevant to long-term water contact exposure.

**Comparative leaching studies**
Published research (reviewed in Geosynthetics International, vol. 24, 2017) on geomembrane
liner materials for potable water and aquaculture applications ranked EPDM alongside HDPE as
the lowest-risk liner material from a water quality perspective, with both significantly
outperforming PVC and bituminous systems. The critical differentiator for EPDM vs HDPE is not
chemical safety (both are biologically safe when correctly formulated) but installation
workability and conformance to irregular geometries.

## EPDM vs HDPE for Aquaculture: Technical Comparison

HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) geomembrane is the other widely used liner in commercial
aquaculture, particularly in large-scale prawn and tilapia ponds in tropical countries. The
comparison between EPDM and HDPE is important for the Portuguese aquaculture market.

**HDPE characteristics:**
- Thickness: 0.5-2.0 mm (typical aquaculture specification: 0.75-1.0 mm)
- Tensile strength: 15-30 N/mm² (higher than EPDM)
- Elongation at break: 500-800% (smooth HDPE), 300-500% (textured HDPE)
- Coefficient of thermal expansion: 1.3-1.8 × 10⁻⁴ mm/mm·°C (significantly higher than EPDM)
- Installation: requires thermal fusion welding (hot wedge or extrusion welding); seams are
  strong when correctly executed but require specialist equipment and skilled operators
- Thermal expansion problem: HDPE expands and contracts significantly with temperature change;
  on a 30°C daily temperature swing, a 10 m span of HDPE moves approximately 40 mm. In ponds
  with exposed liner above the waterline, this causes wrinkling and wave formation that creates
  settlement points for debris, fish waste, and pathogens.
- UV resistance: HDPE with 2-3% carbon black has acceptable UV resistance but is more prone to
  surface stress cracking under sustained UV exposure than EPDM.
- Seaming: thermal fusion welding is reliable but requires operator training, dry and controlled
  conditions, and specialist equipment. Defective welds in HDPE ponds are a significant
  operational risk; field repairs to HDPE liners are challenging and time-consuming.
- Root and sharp object penetration: HDPE's higher stiffness means it is less forgiving of point
  loads and substrate irregularities than EPDM.

**EPDM advantages over HDPE in aquaculture:**
- Lower thermal expansion coefficient (approximately 5-7 × 10⁻⁵ mm/mm·°C for EPDM vs 1.3-1.8
  × 10⁻⁴ for HDPE): less wrinkling and thermal movement in exposed pond areas.
- Cold-bonded seaming with EPDM adhesive and QuickSeam tape: no specialist welding equipment;
  seaming possible in lower temperatures and less ideal field conditions than thermal fusion.
- Conformance to irregular geometry: EPDM's rubber elasticity allows it to conform to uneven
  substrates, roots, and construction irregularities without localised stress concentration.
- Puncture resistance: EPDM's elongation allows it to deform around penetrating objects rather
  than fracturing; HDPE's higher stiffness causes it to concentrate stress at the penetration
  point.
- Repair simplicity: EPDM patches can be cold-bonded in the field without specialist equipment;
  HDPE repairs require thermal fusion tools and are difficult to execute to full structural
  integrity in field conditions.

**HDPE advantages over EPDM:**
- Lower cost per m² (typically 20-35% lower material cost for equivalent thickness)
- Higher tensile strength (relevant for very large spans or high hydraulic head applications)
- Better performance with large-scale thermal fusion seaming on extensive flat-bottomed ponds
  where site conditions are well-controlled
- More established supply chain in large-scale commercial aquaculture globally

For the Portuguese market — characterised by small to medium-scale operations, irregular pond
geometries, and the need for installation by contractors without specialist welding equipment —
EPDM's installation advantages typically outweigh its higher material cost.

## Portuguese Aquaculture Market Context

Portugal has a significant aquaculture sector concentrated in distinct regional clusters:

**Ria de Aveiro (Aveiro coastal lagoon system)**
The largest aquaculture production area in Portugal. Traditional salt pans (salinas) have been
progressively converted to semi-intensive fish and shellfish production. Principal species: sea
bass (robalo, Dicentrarchus labrax), sea bream (dourada, Sparus aurata), sole (linguado), and
clam (amêijoa, Ruditapes decussatus). Water is brackish to marine. Pond lining requirements
are determined by the clay-rich substrate: many Ria de Aveiro ponds rely on the natural
impermeability of compacted clay, but conversion of salinas often requires liner installation
to manage hydraulic control and prevent contamination from surrounding tidal flat sediments.

**Algarve coast and Ria Formosa**
The Ria Formosa is the principal shellfish production zone in Portugal, particularly for
clams, oysters (Crassostrea gigas), mussels (Mexilhão), and sea bass/bream. Production
is primarily in on-bottom rearing systems in the estuary itself, but land-based pond systems
for juvenile production and fattening operate along the eastern Algarve coast.

**Atlantic coastline (Peniche, Viana do Castelo, Figueira da Foz)**
Marine fish aquaculture in floating cage systems offshore, with land-based hatchery and
juvenile production facilities requiring lined tanks and raceways.

**Inland trout production (Serra da Estrela, Minho, Trás-os-Montes)**
Rainbow trout (truta arco-íris, Oncorhynchus mykiss) is farmed in raceways and ponds fed
by cold mountain rivers and springs. The industry is concentrated in the northwest and
north-central regions. Water temperatures of 8-14°C year-round are typical. EPDM lining of
concrete raceways and earth ponds is well-established in this sector.

**Ornamental fish (koi, carp, tropical) — national distribution**
A diffuse but significant market segment. Private koi ponds, ornamental water gardens, and
aquatic landscaping installations are distributed across the country, with concentration
in greater Lisbon, greater Porto, and tourist areas. The koi market is particularly price-
insensitive on liner quality — koi hobbyists understand that fish health depends directly
on water quality, which depends on the liner material.

**Portuguese aquaculture production statistics (DGRM/INE, 2023):**
- Total aquaculture production: approximately 12,500 tonnes per year
- Principal freshwater species: rainbow trout (~3,200 t), common carp, ornamental species
- Principal marine species: sea bass (~2,800 t), sea bream (~2,600 t), turbot, Atlantic salmon
- Principal shellfish: clam, oyster, mussel
- Number of licensed aquaculture operations: approximately 900
- Sector growth: approximately 5-8% per year by value, driven by marine fish expansion

## UV Stability in Permanent Water Contact

Aquaculture ponds present a specific UV challenge: the exposed pond margin — the area of liner
above the permanent water line and at the water's edge — receives full solar irradiance without
the attenuating effect of the water column. This exposed margin may extend 30-60 cm above the
operating water level depending on pond design and seasonal water level variation.

EPDM's UV stability in this zone is critical and well-established:
- The saturated polymer backbone does not absorb UV in the critical 290-400 nm range responsible
  for photooxidative chain scission
- Carbon black (30-40 phr) acts as a broadband UV absorber at the surface, dissipating UV
  energy as heat before it can reach the polymer chains
- EN ISO 4892-3 xenon arc weathering tests (2,000 hours, equivalent to approximately 20-30
  years of Portuguese solar exposure) show no surface cracking, no loss of elongation > 10%,
  and no visible chalking in EPDM geomembrane formulations
- Firestone GeoPond field data (30+ years): ponds lined with EPDM geomembrane in operation
  since the late 1980s show no UV-related degradation in regularly inspected samples

The submerged portion of the liner receives UV doses that are 70-95% attenuated relative to
the surface, depending on water clarity and depth. For fish ponds, where water turbidity is
often elevated by suspended organics, UV penetration to the pond floor is negligible. The
practical UV service life of submerged EPDM is essentially unlimited relative to its other
material properties.

## Water Quality Interactions Between Liner Material and Aquaculture Production

The liner material in a fish pond has direct water quality implications beyond simple chemical
toxicity. These indirect effects are often overlooked in liner selection decisions:

**Dissolved oxygen management**
EPDM's dark colour absorbs solar radiation efficiently. In uncovered ponds in warm Portuguese
summers, the black liner accelerates water warming. Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than
cool water (approximately 9.1 mg/L at 20°C vs 7.6 mg/L at 30°C). For species requiring high
dissolved oxygen (trout: > 8 mg/L; sea bass: > 6 mg/L), water temperature management is
critical. In practice, increased aeration is the standard mitigation.

**Biofilm dynamics**
EPDM supports nitrifying biofilm on its surface in low-flow areas, which can contribute to
biological nitrogen cycling. This is generally positive in recirculating systems (RAS) and
semi-intensive ponds but can indicate organic loading in high-density production systems.
The EPDM surface does not leach biocides that would inhibit beneficial biofilm formation —
unlike some PVC formulations that contain TBTO (tributyltin oxide) or other biostatic additives.

**pH buffering**
EPDM has no interaction with water pH. It neither buffers nor alters the pH of the pond water.
This is important in trout production where precise pH control (7.0-7.5) is required, and in
marine species production where pH must match seawater values (8.0-8.3).

**Sediment accumulation**
EPDM-lined ponds accumulate organic sediment (uneaten feed, faeces, decomposed material) on
the pond floor. The smooth, consistent EPDM surface facilitates mechanical pond cleaning and
allows efficient siphon removal of accumulated sediment — an operational advantage over rough
concrete surfaces where sediment lodges in surface irregularities.
