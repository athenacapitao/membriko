# Fish Ponds / Tanques de Aquacultura — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Fish ponds and aquaculture tanks represent a specialised but high-value application of EPDM
waterproofing where the stakes extend beyond structural integrity to biological consequences.
A liner that leaches harmful compounds destroys the production system — potentially wiping out
tens of thousands of euros in fish stock overnight. The persuasion architecture for this page
must therefore lead with biological safety and fish health, before addressing the structural
and economic arguments.

The page serves three distinct audiences:

1. **Commercial aquaculture operators** (trout farms, sea bass and sea bream producers, shellfish
   hatcheries) who understand production economics and regulatory compliance. For these readers,
   the decision criteria are: biological safety certifications, cost per m² vs alternatives,
   installation disruption, and expected liner lifespan in continuous water contact.

2. **Ornamental pond owners** (koi hobbyists, garden pond enthusiasts, landscaping projects)
   who are emotionally invested in their fish and therefore highly receptive to fish-safety
   arguments. This is a price-insensitive segment where quality certification arguments land
   strongly.

3. **Aquaculture consultants, architects, and engineers** specifying liner systems for new pond
   construction or rehabilitation projects. These readers need the technical data tables, test
   standards, and regulatory compliance information.

The persuasion arc: fish health and liner toxicity (the emotional and practical hook) →
EPDM chemistry as the reason for biological safety → pond type diversity → installation process
→ EPDM vs HDPE/PVC (the comparison most likely in the reader's mind) → Portuguese regulatory
context (DRAP, ICNF) → FAQ that handles the most common objections. Close with a specific,
credibility-building CTA tied to the aquaculture context.

Portugal's aquaculture identity — the trout farms of the Serra da Estrela, the sea bass and
sea bream production in the Ria de Aveiro, the clam and oyster beds of the Ria Formosa, the
koi pond culture among rural and suburban property owners — provides culturally resonant
context for the opening section.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Aquaculture and the Critical Liner Decision

**Purpose:** Establish the stakes (fish lives, production economics) and introduce the
Membriko proposition before the reader has time to disengage.

**Content:**
- Open with the specific context of Portuguese aquaculture: the trout farmers of the Minho
  and Serra da Estrela, the sea bass and sea bream producers of the Ria de Aveiro and Algarve,
  the koi hobbyist in Coimbra or Setúbal who has spent years building a garden pond. All of
  them share one critical vulnerability: the liner under their fish.
- The fundamental problem: most pond liner materials are not biologically neutral. PVC liners
  leach plasticisers into the water column. Concrete absorbs and releases compounds that
  affect pH and alkalinity. HDPE thermal seams, if improperly executed, can degrade and
  release antioxidant additives at elevated temperatures. Only EPDM combines the chemical
  inertness of a saturated elastomer with the installation flexibility that irregular pond
  geometries demand.
- The Membriko proposition: aquaculture-grade EPDM geomembrane, correctly specified and
  installed by Membriko's technicians from Pombal, provides a biologically safe, structurally
  durable, and economically rational liner solution for every type of fish pond in Portugal.
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / fish-safe (ACS/WRAS/NSF 61 certified) / 400%
  elongation / 20-year Membriko warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação Técnica Gratuita"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Fish Ponds

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the chemistry argument for biological safety and
structural durability in aquaculture environments.

**Content:**
- The single most important question in aquaculture liner selection: what does the liner
  release into the water? Enumerate the risk compounds in alternative liner types (PVC
  plasticisers, bituminous compounds, uncured concrete alkalis) and contrast with EPDM's
  zero-leaching profile.
- Physical and chemical properties table:

| Property | Aquaculture-Grade EPDM | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard commercial) | 1.0-1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (heavy-duty/rocky substrate) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Water absorption | < 1% | ASTM D471 |
| Plasticiser content | Zero | — |
| Heavy metal migration | Below detection limit | EN 12457 |
| pH effect on water | None | — |
| Water contact certification | ACS / WRAS / NSF 61 | — |
| UV resistance (exposed margin) | No degradation at 2,000 hrs | EN ISO 4892-3 |
| Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

- Key certifications: ACS (France), WRAS (UK), NSF/ANSI 61 (international) — all confirming
  no harmful leaching at concentrations detectable above regulatory thresholds.

## Section 3: Pond Types — Trout, Sea Bass, Tilapia, Ornamental Koi, Shrimp

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko understands the specific requirements of different
aquaculture systems and fish species, not a generic geomembrane supplier.

**Content:** Five pond type cards.

**Rainbow Trout Raceways and Ponds (Trutas)**
- Context: cold mountain water (8-14°C), high dissolved oxygen requirements, high fish density,
  frequent mechanical cleaning of accumulated sediment; predominantly in Minho and north-central
  Portugal
- EPDM benefit: smooth liner surface facilitates siphon cleaning; cold water temperature within
  EPDM's service range; no chemical interaction with the low-temperature high-oxygen water

**Sea Bass and Sea Bream Ponds (Robalo e Dourada)**
- Context: brackish to marine water (15-35 g/L salinity), semi-intensive or intensive
  production, earth ponds or concrete tanks, warmer water (18-28°C) in production season;
  Ria de Aveiro and Algarve coast concentration
- EPDM benefit: full compatibility with brackish and marine water chemistry; salt resistance
  superior to concrete (no chloride attack) and PVC (no plasticiser extraction by saline water)

**Tilapia and Warm-Water Species Ponds**
- Context: recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) or outdoor ponds in warmer southern regions;
  water temperature 25-30°C; often used in integrated agri-aquaculture systems
- EPDM benefit: stable at continuous warm water temperatures; no leaching at elevated thermal
  conditions where plasticiser migration from PVC accelerates

**Ornamental Koi and Garden Ponds (Carpas Koi)**
- Context: private garden ponds, landscaping installations, hotel and resort ornamental water
  features; koi are highly sensitive to water chemistry; owners are knowledgeable and quality-
  driven; irregular geometries common
- EPDM benefit: fish-safe certification eliminates koi health risk; 400%+ elongation allows
  installation in complex organic shapes without seams in most garden pond sizes; no black dye
  or pigment migration (carbon black is insoluble)

**Shrimp and Shellfish Hatchery Tanks**
- Context: intensive indoor or semi-indoor production of post-larvae in lined tanks; saline
  water (28-35 g/L); post-larvae are extremely sensitive to water quality and chemical
  contaminants; temperature controlled at 25-30°C
- EPDM benefit: NSF 61 certified formulations provide maximum chemical neutrality for the
  most sensitive life stages of high-value shellfish species

## Section 4: Fish and Ecosystem Safety — The Liner Toxicity Argument

**Purpose:** Address the core concern of every aquaculture operator and serious hobbyist:
will the liner harm the fish?

**Content:**
- Structured comparison of liner material toxicity risks:
  - PVC: phthalate plasticisers migrate at a measurable rate; elevated temperatures (summer
    pond surface temperatures in Portugal of 25-35°C) accelerate migration; phthalates are
    endocrine disruptors; several (DEHP, DBP, BBP) are restricted under EU REACH regulation
  - Bituminous systems: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in bitumen and
    leach in water-contact applications; some PAHs are highly toxic to fish at ppb concentrations;
    bituminous liners are not appropriate for aquaculture
  - Concrete: pH can be elevated significantly (pH 11-13) during curing; alkali release
    continues for months to years in new concrete ponds; must be neutralised before fish
    introduction; ongoing pH management is required
  - HDPE: biologically safe when correctly formulated with approved carbon black grades;
    antioxidant additives (Irganox, Irgafos class) have low migration potential but some
    are detectable in water; generally considered safe for aquaculture above hatchery grade
  - EPDM: no plasticisers; no PAHs; no free monomers above trace levels; carbon black
    insoluble; vulcanisation residues (ZnO, antioxidants) below migration thresholds per
    ACS/WRAS/NSF 61 testing; zero documented cases of fish mortality attributable to
    EPDM liner toxicity in reviewed literature
- Regulatory reference: EU Directive 98/83/EC (drinking water); Portuguese Decreto-Lei
  306/2007 (qualidade da água); REACH Regulation EC 1907/2006 on restricted substances

   substrate assessment (earth, concrete, rock), water source and quality data, species and
   production system information, drainage and aeration infrastructure positions
2. **Projeto de Dimensionamento** — Cut plan optimising membrane panel layout to minimise
   seams; specification of liner thickness and formulation grade; selection of penetration
   accessories for aeration inlets, drainage outlets, standpipes, and monitoring equipment
3. **Preparação do Substrato** — Earth pond: compaction and grading to eliminate sharp
   stones and protrusions; concrete pond: crack repair, grinding of sharp edges, cleaning
   of contaminating deposits; geotextile underlay specification where substrate is rocky
   or irregular
4. **Instalação da Geomembrana** — Panel deployment beginning at the lowest point; temporary
   ballasting to prevent wind displacement; alignment and overlap marking for seam positions
5. **Emendas com Sistema EPDM QuickSeam** — Seam bonding using EPDM primer and QuickSeam
   lap tape; minimum 75 mm overlap at all seams; seam probing and visual inspection

## Section 6: Water Quality Management with EPDM

**Purpose:** Demonstrate understanding of how liner material interacts with production water
quality — a key differentiator that shows technical depth beyond generic waterproofing.

**Content:**
- pH stability: EPDM does not affect water pH, unlike new concrete which elevates pH to 11-13
  and requires months of flush cycles before fish can be safely introduced
- Dissolved oxygen: dark EPDM liner absorbs solar heat; relevant for outdoor ponds in summer;
  addressed by adequate aeration design; note that EPDM is available in lighter grey tones
  for installations where solar heating is undesirable
- Biofilm: EPDM supports the establishment of beneficial nitrifying biofilm on submerged
  surfaces; no biostatic additives that inhibit beneficial bacteria
- Cleaning and disinfection: EPDM withstands standard aquaculture disinfection protocols
  including calcium hypochlorite (high-level chlorination for pond turnover), potassium
  permanganate treatment, and salt treatments; no liner degradation at any protocol
  concentration
- Sediment management: smooth EPDM surface facilitates efficient mechanical cleaning;
  reduced dead zones compared to rough concrete surfaces
- Chemical treatment compatibility: EPDM is compatible with all standard aquaculture
  treatments including antibiotics administered in feed, bath treatments (formalin, hydrogen
  peroxide for parasite control), and feed additives

## Section 7: EPDM vs HDPE / PVC / Concrete (Aquaculture-Specific Comparison)

**Purpose:** Address the specific competitive landscape in aquaculture liner selection.

**Content:** Comparison table.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE | PVC | Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Biological safety (fish) | Excellent — ACS/WRAS/NSF 61 | Good — approved grades | Moderate — plasticiser migration | Variable — pH elevation risk |
| Elongation / conformance | Excellent — 400%+ | Good — 500-800% | Moderate — 100-200% | None — rigid |
| Cold-weather installation | Excellent — to -20°C | Moderate — welding difficult | Poor — brittle in cold | Moderate |
| Repair simplicity | Excellent — cold bond | Moderate — requires welding | Moderate | Poor — structural repair |
| Thermal expansion | Low — stable dimensions | High — wrinkling risk | Moderate | Low |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 85 (material) / 105 (installed) | 90 / 130 (replacement) | 200 (maintenance/repair) |
| pH effect on water | None | None | None | Elevated (new concrete) |
| Plasticiser leaching | None | None | Yes — phthalates | N/A |

## Section 8: Pond Design and Engineering Considerations

**Purpose:** Serve the aquaculture engineer and consultant audience with content relevant
to new pond design, not just renovation.

**Content:**
- Substrate classification and liner specification:
  - Category A (sandy/clay soil, no sharp elements): 0.75-1.0 mm EPDM, no geotextile required
  - Category B (mixed soil with occasional stones): 1.0 mm EPDM on 200 g/m² geotextile
  - Category C (rocky substrate or coarse aggregate): 1.5 mm EPDM on 400 g/m² needle-punched
    geotextile
  - Category D (aggressive substrate, vehicle access to pond for harvest): 2.0 mm EPDM on
    400 g/m² geotextile
- Pond geometry: EPDM accommodates any plan geometry (rectangular, circular, kidney, free-form)
  and any side slope from horizontal to 1:1 (45°); steeper slopes require mechanical anchoring
- Anchor trench design: perimeter anchor trench minimum 300 mm wide × 300 mm deep; backfill
  with compacted granular material; at inlet/outlet structures, EPDM continues under the
  concrete headwall
- Standpipe and drainage details: EPDM pond drain details use compression-sealed pipe boots
  (EPDM to PVC or HDPE pipe); no drilling through the membrane for penetrations — all
  penetrations use above-liner connection details
- Freeboard: recommend minimum 300 mm freeboard between operating water level and anchor
  trench; exposed liner in this zone receives maximum UV exposure and should be specified
  with carbon-black EPDM (not grey variants)
- Wave action: in large ponds with surface area > 5,000 m², fetch-driven wave action can
  cause liner movement at the water's edge; recommend riprap or geocell protection at the
  waterline margin for ponds of this scale

---

## Section 9: Aeration and Filtration Integration

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko understands the operational infrastructure of
aquaculture systems and can design liner details around it, not just lay membrane.

**Content:**
- Aeration system penetrations: diffuser tubes and air distribution manifolds penetrate the
  liner at multiple points in intensive production systems; EPDM compression pipe boot details
  accommodate 20-200 mm diameter pipes at any penetration angle
- Bottom drain systems: central bottom drain linked to external standpipe for gravity drainage
  without pumping; EPDM pond drain flange detail with compression ring seal; important that
  drain is installed before liner deployment
- Recirculating system (RAS) compatibility: EPDM-lined sumps and buffer tanks in RAS systems;
  liner compatible with all filter media and drum filter backwash flows
- Inlet structures: inlet pipes typically penetrate above the waterline; EPDM turns up and
  over the inlet structure; concrete inlet headwall installed after liner with liner encapsulated
- Monitoring equipment: dissolved oxygen probes, temperature sensors, pH loggers are installed
  on poles or frames anchored outside the liner perimeter; no membrane penetrations required
  for monitoring equipment in well-designed systems
- Net and cover support: overhead netting and pond covers (for predator exclusion or
  temperature management) are supported by external framework that does not penetrate
  the pond liner

## Section 11: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that EPDM ponds require minimal liner-specific maintenance and
provide practical operational guidance.

**Content:**
- Annual inspection protocol: check anchor trench for erosion or displacement; inspect
  waterline zone (maximum UV exposure point) for any surface change; check all pipe
  penetration seals for compression and seam integrity; document in photographic record
- Pond cleaning: EPDM withstands high-pressure washing (up to 150 bar) for pond floor and
  wall cleaning between production cycles; no liner-specific cleaning products required
- Disinfection between stocking cycles: calcium hypochlorite at 20-50 mg/L, 24-48 hour
  contact, followed by thorough rinsing — fully compatible with EPDM liner
- Sediment removal: siphon or vacuum systems operate directly over EPDM without damage;
  recommended to avoid dragging rigid metal equipment across the liner floor
- Repair protocol: punctures and small tears repaired with EPDM patch and cold-bond
  adhesive; patch must be minimum 150 mm larger than defect in all directions; large seam
  failures (> 1 m) should be repaired by Membriko technicians
- What to avoid: sharp agricultural tools, forks, and unprotected metal anchors dragged
  across the liner; vehicle access to pond floor (unless 2.0 mm liner with geotextile specified)
- Membriko five-year inspection offer: technical liner inspection service with written
  condition assessment and recommendations; included in maintenance contracts

## Section 12: Portuguese Aquaculture Regulations (DRAP, ICNF)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate regulatory knowledge relevant to commercial aquaculture operators,
who face a complex licensing environment in Portugal.

**Content:**
- DGRM (Direção-Geral de Recursos Naturais, Segurança e Serviços Marítimos): the national
  authority for aquaculture licensing; issues licenças de aquacultura under Decreto-Lei
  38/2017 (aquaculture framework); liner material specification is evaluated as part of the
  facility environmental impact assessment
- DRAP (Direções Regionais de Agricultura e Pescas): regional implementation of aquaculture
  licensing and inspection; DRAP Norte, Centro, Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, Alentejo, Algarve;
  inspection of licensed operations includes water quality monitoring
- ICNF (Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas): relevant for aquaculture
  operations within or adjacent to protected areas (Rede Natura 2000, Parques Naturais,
  REN — Reserva Ecológica Nacional); EPDM's absence of leachable contaminants is advantageous
  in environmental impact assessments for protected-area aquaculture licensing
- DQA (Directiva Quadro da Água / EU Water Framework Directive): requires maintenance of
  ecological status in receiving water bodies; aquaculture effluent must comply with
  environmental quality standards; liner material that contributes no contaminants to
  effluent (EPDM) reduces environmental compliance risk
- ASAE (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica): inspects fish production facilities
  for food safety compliance; liner material used in food fish production is subject to
  food contact material regulations under EU Regulation 1935/2004; ACS/WRAS/NSF 61
  certified EPDM provides the documentation basis for food contact compliance
- Private ornamental ponds: no specific liner licensing requirements; fish welfare is the
  primary driver

---

## Section 13: Commercial vs Recreational Ponds

**Purpose:** Distinguish the different value propositions for commercial aquaculture operators
(production economics) and recreational/ornamental pond owners (fish welfare and aesthetics).

**Content:**

**Commercial Production Ponds**
- Value proposition: liner durability (50+ years vs 10-15 for PVC) reduces lifecycle cost;
  fish-safe certification eliminates contamination risk to food fish; smooth surface reduces
  cleaning time between production cycles; 20-year warranty compatible with farm financing
- Scale: typical commercial earth pond 1,000-10,000 m² per cell; Membriko has experience
  with large-format liner projects and can mobilise accordingly
- Total cost of ownership: EPDM liner installed at 15-20 €/m² vs PVC at 8-12 €/m² with
  replacement every 12-15 years; over 30 years, EPDM is typically 30-40% lower total cost

**Recreational and Ornamental Ponds**
- Value proposition: fish health as the primary argument; koi hobbyists invest heavily in
  fish and therefore in water quality; EPDM is the reference material in koi pond construction
  in the UK and Northern European markets
- Scale: typically 5-500 m²; most garden pond projects can be lined with a single or two-
  panel installation minimising seams to zero or one
- Aesthetics: dark EPDM creates a natural, depth-illusion effect in ornamental ponds;
  planting shelves, bog filter zones, and beach entry areas all installed in EPDM without
  material change
- Membriko residential pond service: same technical installation standards applied to
  garden ponds as to commercial aquaculture; minimum project size applies for commercial
  terms; residential pond enquiries welcome

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail aquaculture search intent and reduce pre-sales queries.

1. **A membrana EPDM é segura para peixes e outros animais aquáticos?**
   Yes — EPDM is certified under ACS (France), WRAS (UK), and NSF/ANSI 61 (international
   standard for drinking water system components) for use in contact with water intended for
   human consumption. This certification is more stringent than most national aquaculture
   regulations. EPDM contains no plasticisers, no biocides, and no PAHs (polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons). No cases of fish mortality attributable to EPDM liner toxicity appear in
   reviewed aquaculture literature. Membriko specifies only aquaculture-certified EPDM
   formulations for fish pond applications.

2. **Quanto tempo posso esperar de vida útil da membrana EPDM num tanque de peixe?**
   EPDM geomembrane in continuous freshwater or brackish water immersion has a projected
   service life of 50+ years based on accelerated ageing studies (ERA/SKZ) and real-world
   field data from ponds installed since the late 1980s. The submerged portion of the liner
   is effectively shielded from UV — the primary external degradation agent — by the water
   column. The exposed margin above the waterline (in direct sun) is the zone requiring
   monitoring, but EPDM's UV resistance is also exceptional there. Membriko provides a
   20-year installation warranty.

3. **Posso instalar EPDM num tanque de betão existente que está a perder água?**
   Yes — this is one of the most common renovation applications. EPDM can be installed over
   concrete surfaces that are structurally sound but leaking through cracks and joint failures.
   Surface preparation requires crack repair with flexible mortar, grinding of sharp edges
   and projections, and thorough cleaning. A geotextile underlay may be specified to protect
   the EPDM from any residual sharp surface irregularity. The installation is typically
   completed in 2-4 days for a standard concrete raceway or pond, with no structural
   demolition required.

4. **Qual a diferença entre EPDM e HDPE para tanques de aquacultura?**
   Both are biologically safe liner materials. HDPE is typically lower in material cost but
   requires thermal fusion welding for seaming — a process that needs specialist equipment
   and is sensitive to field conditions. EPDM is cold-seamed with adhesive and QuickSeam
   tape, making it more accessible to install in standard field conditions without specialist
   welding rigs. EPDM also has significantly lower thermal expansion than HDPE (which can
   wrinkle noticeably with temperature change), and is easier to repair in the field.
   For Portugal's smaller-scale aquaculture operations and ornamental ponds, Membriko
   recommends EPDM for its installation reliability advantage.

5. **O EPDM é adequado para lagoas de carpa koi?**
   EPDM is the reference liner material for koi ponds in the UK, Netherlands, and Germany
   — the countries where koi keeping is most developed technically. Koi hobbyists demand
   the highest water quality standards because koi are sensitive to organic compounds and
   pH instability. EPDM's zero-leaching profile, biological neutrality, and compatibility
   with UV sterilisers, ozone systems, and high-biological-load filtration make it the
   material of choice. Membriko applies the same installation standards to garden koi ponds
   as to commercial aquaculture installations.

6. **O EPDM resiste à água salgada dos tanques de peixes marinhos?**
   Yes — EPDM is fully resistant to saline water across the full range from freshwater to
   marine salinity (0-40 g/L). The saturated polymer backbone is not affected by salt ions,
   and there is no mechanism for salt-related degradation. This makes EPDM equally suitable
   for trout raceways (freshwater), sea bass earth ponds (brackish), and marine fish hatchery
   tanks (full seawater). Concrete ponds for marine species are subject to chloride-induced
   reinforcement corrosion over time — a problem that does not exist with EPDM-lined ponds.

7. **Qual a espessura de EPDM recomendada para o meu tanque de peixe?**
   The recommended thickness depends on the substrate and operational loading:
   — 0.75 mm: ornamental garden ponds on prepared sandy/clay substrate, no vehicle access
   — 1.0 mm: standard commercial earth ponds on prepared substrate with geotextile underlay
   — 1.5 mm: rocky or irregular substrates, concrete pond renovation, higher-risk environments
   — 2.0 mm: heavy-duty ponds with vehicle access for harvesting, extremely rocky substrates,
     or where long service intervals between inspections require maximum mechanical resilience
   Membriko's site visit determines the correct specification for each project.

8. **Quanto tempo após a instalação do EPDM posso introduzir os peixes?**
   A freshly installed and water-filled EPDM pond should be allowed to run with clean water
   circulation for a minimum of 7 days before fish introduction. This allows any surface
   residues from installation (adhesive, handling compounds) to dilute and flush out, and
   allows the biological cycle to begin establishing in the pond system. Membriko provides
   a written pre-stocking protocol with every commercial pond installation, including water
   quality targets (ammonia < 0.5 mg/L, nitrite < 0.1 mg/L, pH 7.0-8.0 for most species)
   that should be achieved before fish are introduced.
