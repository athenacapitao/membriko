# Fish Pond and Aquaculture Tank Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Portugal's Aquaculture Sector and the Liner Decision That Defines It

Portugal's fishing and aquaculture heritage runs deep. The rainbow trout farms of the Minho valley and the Serra da Estrela mountains, the sea bass and sea bream production tanks of the Ria de Aveiro, the oyster and clam beds of the Ria Formosa in the Algarve — aquaculture in Portugal is not a new industry seeking to establish itself. It is an activity woven into the landscape, the regional economy, and the food culture of the country. What has changed over the past two decades is the scale of investment, the intensity of production systems, and the level of technical scrutiny applied to every component of those systems.

At the centre of that technical scrutiny sits a decision that many producers still make on price alone: the choice of pond liner. The material that separates the water from the substrate, that stands between the fish and the structural concrete or compacted earth beneath them, that forms the chemical interface with every litre of the production environment — that material defines, in measurable terms, the biological safety and operational longevity of the aquaculture system.

Membriko, based in Pombal at the geographical heart of Portugal, works exclusively with EPDM rubber geomembrane for aquaculture tanks, fish ponds, and ornamental water features. The reason is not commercial preference. It is the weight of evidence from polymer chemistry, from ecotoxicology, from field performance data, and from the practical experience of aquaculture operators who have used every available liner material and converged on EPDM as the rational choice. This page sets out that case with the technical rigour it deserves.

## Why EPDM is the Right Material for Fish Ponds

The defining question in aquaculture liner selection is not simply "is this material watertight?" Any geomembrane worth specifying is watertight. The question that separates materials is: **what does this liner release into the water, and what does that do to the fish?**

This question eliminates most competing liner materials from serious aquaculture consideration.

### The Plasticiser Problem in PVC

Plasticised PVC — the most economically accessible pond liner material — contains between 20% and 40% by mass of plasticiser compounds (typically phthalate esters such as DEHP, DBP, and BBP) physically incorporated into the polymer matrix. These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to the PVC backbone. They are present as a miscible liquid phase dispersed through the solid polymer, and they migrate progressively into water in contact with the liner. Migration rate increases with water temperature and is accelerated by UV irradiance on the exposed liner margin above the waterline.

Phthalate plasticisers are documented endocrine disruptors in fish. DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) is classified as a Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) under the EU REACH Regulation (EC 1907/2006). In intensive aquaculture environments where fish density is high and water exchange may be restricted, the accumulation of phthalates in the water column is a real and measurable risk to fish health and to the food safety of the final product.

### The Bituminous Contamination Risk

Bituminous systems — modified bitumen membranes, asphalt emulsions, coal tar coatings — contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are acutely toxic to aquatic organisms at concentrations measured in parts per billion. The use of bituminous waterproofing in direct contact with production water in fish ponds is incompatible with any food safety standard. Membriko has encountered situations where producers chose bituminous systems on cost grounds and experienced catastrophic fish mortality within the first days of operation. The apparent cost saving is illusory.

### Concrete pH and Alkali Release

Freshly cured concrete releases calcium hydroxide into contact water, elevating pH to values between 11 and 13 — lethal to virtually all fish and crustacean species. New concrete ponds require multiple intensive flush cycles over weeks to months before fish can be safely introduced. Even after this conditioning period, the concrete surface remains porous and rough, accumulating organic sediment in surface irregularities that are difficult to clean and become foci for pathogen multiplication.

### EPDM: The Chemistry That Protects Fish

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) rubber's primary polymer chain is composed exclusively of single carbon-to-carbon and carbon-to-hydrogen bonds — a saturated structure that is chemically inert in freshwater, brackish water, and controlled saline environments. It contains no plasticisers. It contains no PAHs. It contains no free monomers above trace levels, and those trace-level vulcanisation residues (zinc oxide activator residues, antioxidants) have been tested at concentrations below regulatory detection thresholds under ACS, WRAS, and NSF/ANSI 61 certification protocols.

Membriko specifies only EPDM carrying ACS (France), WRAS (United Kingdom), and NSF/ANSI 61 (international) certification for all fish pond and aquaculture tank applications. These certifications involve migration testing under conditions that are more demanding than the real conditions of any aquaculture pond in Portugal, and the certified EPDM passes at below-detection-limit concentrations.

| Property | Aquaculture-Grade EPDM (Membriko) | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard commercial) | 1.0-1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (demanding substrate) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Water absorption | < 1% | ASTM D471 |
| Plasticiser content | Zero | — |
| Heavy metal migration | Below detection limit | EN 12457 |
| pH effect on water | None | — |
| Water contact certification | ACS / WRAS / NSF 61 | — |
| UV resistance (exposed margin) | No degradation at 2,000 hours | EN ISO 4892-3 |
| Projected service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Pond Types and Species — From Trout Raceways to Koi Gardens

Membriko has direct experience across the full spectrum of aquaculture applications present in Portugal. Each production system has specific requirements that determine the correct membrane specification.

### Rainbow Trout Raceways and Ponds

Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) production is the primary freshwater aquaculture activity in Portugal, concentrated in the Minho, Alto Minho, Serra da Estrela, and Trás-os-Montes regions. Production systems are spring-fed or river-fed raceways maintaining water temperatures of 8 to 14°C and dissolved oxygen concentrations above 8 mg/L — conditions that trout require for healthy growth and feed conversion.

Trout are sensitive to water chemistry perturbation. Membriko regularly lines existing concrete raceways — often tanks with decades of service whose walls have cracked and are losing water at rates that compromise production economics — with 1.5 mm EPDM membrane over protective geotextile. The result is a chemically neutral, smooth surface that does not interact with the cold, highly oxygenated water, and that facilitates the mechanical removal of accumulated organic sediment by suction cleaning between production cycles.

The zero pH effect of EPDM in contact with cold spring water ensures no chemical interaction with the production environment. This contrasts with new concrete, which would require months of flush conditioning before the same raceways could be safely stocked.

### Sea Bass and Sea Bream Earth Ponds

Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sea bream (Sparus aurata) production in earth ponds represents the most economically significant segment of Portuguese marine aquaculture, with concentrations in the Ria de Aveiro, the Sado estuary, and the eastern Algarve coast. Earth ponds — converted from former salt pans or constructed from scratch — operate with brackish to marine water (15 to 35 g/L salinity) and production-season water temperatures of 18 to 28°C.

Membriko installs EPDM geomembrane in these ponds with specifications adapted to marine conditions. EPDM is fully resistant to saline water across the complete salinity spectrum from freshwater to full seawater — the chloride ions that cause reinforcement corrosion in concrete marine structures have no interaction with EPDM rubber. For large-format earth ponds of 1,000 to 10,000 m² per cell, Membriko mobilises appropriately, deploying large-format EPDM panels with seaming layouts optimised to minimise total seam length.

### Warm-Water Species — Tilapia and Recirculating Systems

Tilapia production (Oreochromis niloticus and related species) in Portugal is an emerging sector, with recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) installations in the warmer southern interior, often integrated into agri-aquaculture systems. Production water temperatures of 25 to 30°C and the high organic loading of intensive RAS environments place specific demands on liner materials — warm water accelerates plasticiser migration from PVC membranes, making EPDM's zero-plasticiser profile particularly important in these conditions.

In RAS environments, Membriko EPDM is used not only for production tank lining but for treatment cisterns, settlement chambers, and flow-regulation reservoirs throughout the water treatment train. Compatibility with the disinfection protocols used in RAS maintenance cycles — including high-concentration calcium hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, and peracetic acid — has been verified and is consistent with EPDM's broad chemical resistance profile.

### Ornamental Koi Ponds and Garden Water Features

The koi market in Portugal has grown significantly over the past decade. Koi keepers are among the most technically demanding clients for pond liner quality — not for aesthetic reasons, but because they understand the direct relationship between liner material safety and fish health. Koi hobbyists in the Lisbon, Porto, and Coimbra areas invest substantially in both their fish and their filtration systems.

Membriko is the specification of choice for serious koi keepers in Portugal because EPDM is the reference material in the most technically advanced koi markets in Europe — the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany — where the hobbyist knowledge base demands the highest standards. No plasticisers, no compounds that interfere with biological filtration bacteria, no risk to fish of any species at any life stage.

For the organic, irregular geometries typical of private koi ponds — planted margins, shelved depth changes, beach entry areas, bog filter zones — Membriko EPDM with 400%+ elongation conforms to any shape without localised stress concentration, and in panel widths up to 15.25 metres that eliminate seams entirely in most garden-scale installations.

### Shrimp and Shellfish Hatchery Tanks

Shrimp production (Litopenaeus vannamei, Penaeus monodon) in Portugal is an emerging sector with experimental and early commercial installations along the Algarve and Alentejo coastlines. Shrimp post-larvae are among the most chemically sensitive organisms in aquaculture — trace contamination from liner materials can cause catastrophic larval mortality in hatchery tanks.

For these applications, Membriko specifies EPDM carrying NSF/ANSI 61 certification — the most rigorous international standard available for materials in contact with water intended for human consumption. This certification level provides the maximum available chemical neutrality documentation for the most sensitive life stages of high-value shellfish species.

---

## Fish and Ecosystem Safety — The Liner Toxicity Case

The biological safety of the pond liner deserves detailed analysis because its importance is consistently underestimated in purchase decisions — until a mass mortality event demonstrates the true cost of that underestimation.

### What the Certifications Actually Test

**ACS (Attestation de Conformité Sanitaire — France):** The ACS certification, issued by accredited laboratories under French Ministry of Health oversight, requires migration testing for sulphur vulcanisation residues, zinc from the ZnO vulcanisation activator, antioxidant compounds, and carbon black extractables. ACS-certified EPDM has demonstrated migration below the thresholds specified in the Arrêté du 29 mai 1997. The test conditions — elevated temperature, extended contact time — are more severe than the real conditions of any aquaculture pond in Portugal.

**WRAS (Water Regulations Advisory Scheme — United Kingdom):** WRAS approval under BS 6920 evaluates odour, taste, appearance change, and extraction of metals and organic compounds from materials in contact with water intended for human consumption. WRAS-approved EPDM geomembrane is used in potable water reservoirs, public swimming pools, and aquaculture systems throughout the United Kingdom. Membriko specifies only WRAS-approved EPDM for all water-contact applications.

**NSF/ANSI 61 (International):** NSF International's Standard 61 for drinking water system components is the international reference standard for materials in contact with drinking water. NSF 61-certified EPDM is in widespread use in fish hatcheries and intensive aquaculture in North America, Australia, and Asia — markets where food certification requirements are extremely demanding. The NSF 61 test protocol is among the most comprehensive migration testing regimes available globally.

### Biological Filtration Compatibility

In biological filtration systems — fundamental in koi ponds, RAS systems, and semi-intensive aquaculture — the presence of biostatic compounds in the liner can inhibit the establishment of nitrifying bacterial colonies that convert ammonia to nitrate. Some PVC formulations contain TBTO (tributyltin oxide) or other biostatic additives that have precisely this effect, effectively poisoning the biological filtration system the operator has invested heavily in.

EPDM contains no biostatic additives. It supports the establishment of nitrifying biofilm on its submerged surface, contributing positively to the nitrogen cycle in the aquatic system. This is not a minor operational detail — it is the difference between a functional biological filter and one that perpetually struggles to establish the bacterial density required for ammonia control.

## Installation Process — Eight Steps to a Fish-Safe Liner

Membriko applies the same technical rigour to a 5 m² ornamental pond and a 10,000 m² commercial production facility. The process is systematic, documented, and delivered with a 20-year warranty.

**Step 1 — Technical Site Assessment**
Free on-site evaluation: pond geometry survey, substrate assessment (earth, concrete, rock), water source and quality data, species and production system details, documentation of all penetration positions for aeration, drainage, standpipes, and monitoring equipment. The assessment produces a written technical report with specification recommendation.

**Step 2 — Membrane Dimensioning and Layout Design**
Cut plan optimising panel arrangement to minimise total seam length. Specification of correct EPDM thickness and formulation for the substrate conditions and production system. Selection of penetration accessories for every singular point in the installation.

**Step 3 — Substrate Preparation**
Earth pond: compaction and grading to remove sharp stones and surface irregularities; geotextile underlay installation where required by substrate classification. Concrete pond: crack repair with flexible mortar, grinding of sharp edges and projections, thorough cleaning and degreasing. New concrete: verification of complete cure before membrane deployment — minimum 28 days.

**Step 4 — Geomembrane Deployment**
Panel unrolling and positioning from the lowest point of the pond upward. Temporary ballasting to prevent wind displacement during deployment. Alignment and seam-position marking before bonding commences.

**Step 5 — Seaming with EPDM QuickSeam System**
Seam bonding using EPDM-specific primer and QuickSeam lap tape — no thermal fusion welding equipment required. Minimum 75 mm overlap maintained at all seams. Visual inspection and probe testing of all seam lines after bonding.

**Step 6 — Singular Points: Penetrations and Perimeter Anchorage**
All aeration inlet, drainage outlet, standpipe, and monitoring pipe penetrations sealed with EPDM compression pipe boots or fabricated collars. Perimeter anchor trench minimum 300 mm wide by 300 mm deep, with membrane folded into trench a minimum of 600 mm, backfilled and compacted in 150 mm layers.

**Step 7 — Watertightness Inspection and Testing**
Visual inspection of all seams and penetrations in dry conditions before water introduction. Controlled fill with 48-hour level monitoring. Photographic as-built record. Electronic leak detection for higher-specification commercial installations.

**Step 8 — Warranty Certificate and Handover**
20-year Membriko installation warranty certificate. Written pre-stocking protocol covering the minimum seven-day circulation period before fish introduction. Membrane maintenance guide. Optional 12-month follow-up inspection offered.

## Water Quality Management with EPDM

The pond liner is not simply a passive barrier. It is a chemical interface with the production environment. Membriko understands this dimension and specifies accordingly.

### pH Stability from Day One

EPDM does not release calcium hydroxide into contact water, unlike freshly cured concrete. A Membriko EPDM-lined pond can be filled and stocked significantly faster than a new concrete tank, which requires weeks to months of intensive flushing before pH stabilises at levels safe for fish introduction. In commercial aquaculture, where every week of production delay has a direct cost, this operational advantage has real economic value.

For existing concrete ponds being renovated with EPDM overlay, the new liner isolates the concrete surface from the production water, ending the ongoing pH management challenge that many concrete pond operators face as a permanent operational burden.

### Dissolved Oxygen and Solar Heating

Dark EPDM absorbs solar radiation efficiently — absorptivity approximately 0.93 for carbon-black-filled rubber. In uncovered outdoor ponds in warm Portuguese summers, this passive solar absorption can increase surface water temperature. For cold-water species like trout, where dissolved oxygen availability decreases with rising temperature (approximately 9.1 mg/L at 20°C versus 7.6 mg/L at 30°C), aeration design must account for this thermal contribution. Membriko also supplies dark grey EPDM as an alternative to black for installations where passive solar heating is undesirable.

### Pond Cleaning and Production-Cycle Disinfection

The smooth surface of EPDM facilitates mechanical sediment removal by suction systems operating directly over the liner without causing damage. Between production cycles, EPDM withstands all standard aquaculture disinfection protocols: calcium hypochlorite at 20-50 mg/L with 48-hour contact, potassium permanganate treatment, hydrogen peroxide bath treatment, and salt treatments. High-pressure washing at up to 150 bar cleans the liner surface without membrane damage. No liner-specific cleaning products are required.

### Veterinary Treatment Compatibility

Common veterinary treatments in intensive aquaculture — including antiparasitic baths (formalin, hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid), antibiotic medicated feeds, and routine bath treatments — have no adverse effect on EPDM membrane. This comprehensive compatibility contrasts with some PVC formulations that degrade under prolonged contact with strong oxidising agents.

## EPDM vs HDPE, PVC, and Concrete — An Aquaculture-Specific Comparison

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE | PVC | Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Biological safety (fish) | Excellent — ACS/WRAS/NSF 61 | Good — approved grades | Moderate — plasticiser migration | Variable — pH elevation risk |
| Elongation / conformance | Excellent — ≥ 400% | Good — 500-800% | Moderate — 100-200% | None — rigid |
| Cold-weather installation | Excellent — to -20°C | Moderate — welding difficult | Poor — brittle in cold | Moderate |
| Field repair simplicity | Excellent — cold bond | Moderate — requires welding | Moderate | Poor — structural repair |
| Thermal expansion | Low — dimensionally stable | High — wrinkling risk | Moderate | Low |
| 30-year total cost index | 100 | 85 (material) / 105 (installed) | 90 / 130 (with replacement) | 200 (maintenance/repair) |
| pH effect on water | None | None | None | Elevated (new concrete) |
| Plasticiser leaching | None | None | Yes — phthalates | N/A |

HDPE is the principal competitor to EPDM in large-scale commercial aquaculture. The material cost advantage of HDPE — typically 20 to 35% lower per m² at equivalent thickness — is frequently eroded by the higher installation cost: HDPE requires thermal fusion welding with specialist equipment, trained operators, controlled field conditions, and represents a more complex field repair challenge when seam defects occur. For the typical scale and field conditions of Portuguese aquaculture operations, Membriko considers EPDM's installation reliability advantage decisive in the total-cost-of-ownership comparison.

## Pond Design and Engineering — New Construction Specifications

For aquaculture consultants, engineers, and producers specifying liner systems for new pond construction, Membriko provides the following substrate-based specification guidelines.

**Category A — Sandy or clay substrate, no sharp elements**
0.75 to 1.0 mm EPDM. Geotextile underlay not mandatory if substrate is carefully prepared, compacted, and free of surface irregularities. Appropriate for ornamental ponds and low-to-medium intensity aquaculture tanks on favourable soils.

**Category B — Mixed soil with occasional stones**
1.0 mm EPDM over 200 g/m² needle-punched geotextile. The geotextile layer distributes point loads and protects the membrane from small-diameter stone penetration.

**Category C — Rocky substrate or coarse aggregate**
1.5 mm EPDM over 400 g/m² needle-punched geotextile. Specified for renovation of concrete tanks with irregular surfaces, or ground with rock outcrops. Membriko regularly specifies this combination for granite trout raceway renovation in the north of Portugal.

**Category D — Demanding substrate, vehicle access for harvest operations**
2.0 mm EPDM over 400 g/m² geotextile. Maximum specification for tanks where harvest equipment — drag nets, suction harvesters — operates over the liner surface during production cycles.

### Anchor Trench and Slope Design

The perimeter anchor trench is the most structurally critical detail in any geomembrane installation. Membriko designs anchor trenches with a minimum of 300 mm width by 300 mm depth, with the membrane folded into the trench a minimum of 600 mm, backfilled in compacted 150 mm layers with granular material. On slopes steeper than 1:2 (26°), intermediate anchor trenches prevent downslope membrane migration under hydraulic head.

At inlet and outlet structures, EPDM is continuous under the concrete headwall, eliminating the liner-to-concrete interface as a potential leakage pathway.

---

## Aeration and Filtration System Integration

Membriko designs penetration details for infrastructure simultaneously with the membrane layout — not as an afterthought after installation is complete. This integrated design approach eliminates the most common source of post-installation leakage in aquaculture pond liners.

### Aeration System Penetrations

Diffuser tubes and air distribution manifolds penetrate the EPDM membrane using compression pipe boots in EPDM rubber. The supported diameter range is 20 mm to 200 mm. Penetrations are sealed by mechanical compression of the boot against the membrane using a stainless steel clamping ring — no gluing or welding at the penetration point. Where surface aeration systems (paddle wheels, surface diffusers) are used without penetrating the pond base, the membrane requires no perforations. Membriko recommends minimising base penetrations wherever aeration design allows.

### Bottom Drainage and Standpipe Systems

The central bottom drain connected to an external standpipe is the standard gravity drainage system for small to medium-scale aquaculture tanks. Membriko's EPDM pond drain detail uses a flanged EPDM drain fitting with a compression ring seal, installed at the lowest point of the pond before membrane deployment — ensuring the drain is integrated with the liner system rather than retrofitted through it.

### Recirculating Aquaculture System Compatibility

In RAS facilities, Membriko EPDM lining is used throughout the water treatment train: production tanks, drum filter collection sumps, biological filter chambers, ozone contact vessels, UV treatment chambers, and storage reservoirs. Compatibility with UV-C treatment — which generates residual ozone and hydrogen peroxide — is confirmed by EPDM's saturated polymer backbone, resistant to ozone attack by the absence of double bonds in the main chain. No other geomembrane material offers this combination of chemical resistance breadth.

### Monitoring Equipment Integration

Dissolved oxygen sensors, temperature probes, pH loggers, and water flow measurement equipment are installed on frames or poles anchored outside the liner perimeter wherever possible, eliminating additional membrane penetrations. Where in-pond sensor mounting is unavoidable, Membriko designs sealed sensor port details using the same compression boot system as aeration penetrations.

## Maintenance — What EPDM Asks of You Over Fifty Years

One of the strongest operational arguments for Membriko EPDM in aquaculture is what it does not require across decades of production service.

### Annual Inspection Protocol

At the start of each production season, Membriko recommends a focused visual inspection of three areas:

1. **Perimeter anchor trench:** check that backfill is intact with no erosion that would expose or stress the membrane edge.
2. **Waterline zone:** the area of maximum UV exposure; check for any surface change, surface cracking, or discolouration in the exposed margin above the operating water level.
3. **Penetration seals:** verify that all pipe boot compression seals and aeration penetration details are intact, with no visible membrane distortion or gap formation.

For commercial installations, Membriko offers a five-year technical inspection service with a written condition assessment and maintenance recommendations.

### Pond Cleaning Between Production Cycles

EPDM's smooth surface facilitates efficient mechanical cleaning. Between production cycles, Membriko recommends:
- Sediment removal by suction siphon before full draining
- High-pressure water washing (up to 150 bar) after pond has been drained
- Disinfection with calcium hypochlorite at 20 to 50 mg/L (24 to 48-hour contact time), followed by thorough rinsing before refilling
- Visual liner inspection in dry conditions before refilling and restocking

### Repair of Mechanical Damage

Point punctures and small tears are repaired by cold-bonding an EPDM patch over the defect with contact adhesive, cleaned and degreased surfaces, and firm roller pressure. The patch must be a minimum of 150 mm larger than the defect in all directions, with rounded corners to prevent edge-lift. Seam failures or defects extending more than one metre in length should be repaired by Membriko field technicians to ensure full structural integrity of the repair.

## Portuguese Aquaculture Regulations — DRAP, ICNF, and the Compliance Framework

Membriko works within Portugal's aquaculture regulatory framework daily. The correct specification of liner material has direct implications for licensing, environmental permitting, and food safety compliance.

### DGRM — National Aquaculture Licensing Authority

The Direção-Geral de Recursos Naturais, Segurança e Serviços Marítimos (DGRM) is the national authority for aquaculture facility licensing under Decreto-Lei 38/2017 (the aquaculture legal framework). Licensing applications include an environmental impact assessment that evaluates materials in contact with production and effluent water. ACS/WRAS/NSF 61 certified EPDM provides the technical certification documentation required to demonstrate liner material safety to the DGRM.

### DRAP — Regional Implementation and Inspection

The Direções Regionais de Agricultura e Pescas (DRAP Norte, Centro, Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, Alentejo, and Algarve) implement aquaculture licensing at the regional level and inspect licensed facilities. Inspections include verification of production conditions and water quality. Membriko provides clients with complete certification documentation packages — ACS, WRAS, NSF 61, EN test reports — appropriate for presentation to DRAP inspectors.

### ICNF — Protected Areas and Natura 2000

The Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas (ICNF) has regulatory authority over aquaculture facilities established within or adjacent to classified areas of the Natura 2000 network, Natural Parks, and the Reserva Ecológica Nacional (REN). In these contexts, environmental impact assessment is more stringent. The complete absence of leachable harmful compounds from EPDM — documented by ACS/WRAS/NSF 61 certification — is a significant positive argument in Environmental Impact Statements for aquaculture development in environmentally sensitive zones.

### Water Framework Directive and Effluent Quality

The EU Water Framework Directive (Directiva Quadro da Água, DQA), transposed into Portuguese law by Decreto-Lei 77/2006, requires the maintenance of good ecological status in receiving water bodies accepting aquaculture effluent. The effluent from an EPDM-lined tank contains no compounds derived from the liner material. This contrasts with PVC-lined ponds, where phthalate plasticisers are detectable in effluent water and may trigger regulatory attention from APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) water quality monitoring services.

### REACH and Food Safety Compliance

REACH Regulation EC 1907/2006 restricts several substances used as PVC plasticisers — including DEHP, DBP, and BBP — in articles that may release these substances into the environment. Producing food fish in a tank lined with phthalate-containing PVC raises food safety questions under EU Regulation 1935/2004 on materials and articles in contact with food. EPDM contains none of these restricted substances.

ASAE (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica) inspects food fish production facilities for food safety compliance. ACS/WRAS/NSF 61 certified EPDM provides the food contact material compliance documentation basis for ASAE inspections.

## Commercial Aquaculture vs Recreational Ponds — Two Distinct Value Propositions

### Commercial Fish Production Facilities

For commercial aquaculture producers, the decision to specify Membriko EPDM is a risk management and total cost of ownership decision.

**Biological risk:** A liner that releases harmful compounds into the production water represents a mass mortality risk that can destroy an entire production cycle. The financial cost of a contamination event — lost fish stock, system decontamination, production restart delay — frequently exceeds the total cost differential between a quality liner and an economical one many times over. Membriko eliminates this risk category entirely.

**Total cost over 30 years:** Membriko EPDM installed at 15 to 20 €/m² has a documented service life exceeding 50 years without replacement. A PVC liner installed at 8 to 12 €/m² requires replacement at 12 to 15 years — which, over a 30-year horizon, implies two or three complete replacement cycles, each with the associated production downtime and installation cost. The total cost of ownership for EPDM is typically 30 to 40% lower than PVC over a 30-year horizon.

**Compatibility with agricultural financing:** Membriko's 20-year installation warranty is compatible with the financing horizons of aquaculture support programmes under PROMAR, MAR2030, and IFD — a practical advantage for producers financing facility development with European structural funds.

### Ornamental and Koi Ponds

For ornamental pond owners and koi enthusiasts, the value proposition differs but is equally compelling.

**Fish health as the primary argument:** Quality koi represent significant financial investment — champion-grade specimens can be worth thousands of euros. Protection of that investment begins with the pond liner. Membriko EPDM eliminates liner-derived chemical contamination as a source of fish mortality or chronic disease — the most preventable category of koi health problems.

**Biological filtration integrity:** The nitrifying biofilm that establishes on submerged surfaces in a healthy biological filtration system is fully compatible with EPDM. No biostatic additives inhibit the colonisation of beneficial Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter bacteria. The filtration investment the hobbyist has made in filter media, pumping, and UV sterilisation performs at full capacity from the first weeks of system establishment.

**Design freedom and geometric complexity:** Koi ponds are typically designed with organic free-form shapes, planted shelves at varying depths, bog filter zones, beach entry areas, and gradual contour changes. Membriko EPDM with 400%+ elongation adapts to any geometry without localised stress concentration, and in panel widths up to 15.25 m that eliminate all seams in most residential-scale pond installations. A seamless liner is not just aesthetically cleaner — it is structurally superior, removing the most vulnerable element from the waterproofing system.

Membriko applies identical installation standards to garden koi ponds and commercial aquaculture production facilities. Contact us for a free technical assessment of your pond project.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is EPDM membrane safe for fish and other aquatic animals?**

Yes — EPDM is certified under ACS (France), WRAS (United Kingdom), and NSF/ANSI 61 (international standard for drinking water system components) for use in contact with water intended for human consumption. This certification level is more stringent than most national aquaculture regulations. EPDM contains no plasticisers, no biocides, and no polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. No cases of fish mortality attributable to EPDM liner toxicity appear in reviewed aquaculture literature. Membriko specifies only EPDM carrying these certifications for all fish pond applications.

**How long can I expect a Membriko EPDM liner to last in a fish pond?**

EPDM geomembrane in continuous freshwater or brackish water immersion has a projected service life exceeding 50 years, based on accelerated ageing studies (ERA/SKZ methodology) and real-world field data from ponds installed since the late 1980s. The submerged portion of the liner is effectively shielded from ultraviolet radiation — the primary external degradation mechanism — by the water column above it. The exposed margin above the waterline receives direct UV irradiance, but EPDM's UV resistance in this zone is also exceptional, supported by the saturated polymer backbone and carbon black UV absorption. Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty on all fish pond projects.

**Can I install EPDM in an existing concrete tank that is leaking?**

Yes — this is one of the most common renovation applications in Membriko's portfolio. EPDM can be installed over concrete surfaces that are structurally sound but leaking through cracks, joint failures, or porous surface areas. Surface preparation requires crack repair with flexible mortar, grinding of sharp edges and projections, and thorough cleaning and degreasing. A protective geotextile underlay is specified wherever the concrete surface has residual irregularities that could concentrate stress on the membrane. Installation for a standard concrete raceway or pond is typically completed in two to four working days, with no structural demolition.

**What is the difference between EPDM and HDPE for aquaculture tanks?**

Both are biologically safe liner materials when correctly formulated. HDPE typically offers lower material cost — 20 to 35% less per m² at equivalent thickness — but requires thermal fusion welding for all seams, a process that demands specialist equipment, trained operators, and controlled field conditions. EPDM is cold-seamed with EPDM-specific primer and QuickSeam tape, accessible to install in standard field conditions without welding rigs. EPDM also has significantly lower thermal expansion than HDPE — which can wrinkle visibly in pond areas exposed to direct sun during temperature swings — and is substantially easier to repair in the field using cold-bonded patches. For Portugal's predominantly small-to-medium-scale aquaculture operations and ornamental ponds, Membriko considers EPDM's installation and maintenance reliability advantage decisive.

**Is EPDM suitable for koi carp ponds?**

EPDM is the reference liner material for koi ponds in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany — the European markets where koi keeping is most technically sophisticated. Koi hobbyists require the highest water quality standards because koi are sensitive to dissolved organic compounds and pH instability. EPDM's zero-leaching profile, biological neutrality, and full compatibility with UV sterilisers, ozone treatment systems, and high-biological-load biological filtration make it the material of choice for serious koi installations globally. Membriko applies the same installation standards to garden koi ponds as to commercial aquaculture production facilities.

**Does EPDM resist the saltwater used in marine fish production tanks?**

Yes — EPDM is fully resistant to saline water across the complete salinity spectrum from freshwater through brackish to full marine concentrations (0 to 40 g/L). The saturated polymer backbone is unaffected by salt ions, and there is no mechanism by which chloride or sulphate ions degrade EPDM under normal aquaculture service conditions. This makes Membriko EPDM equally suitable for cold freshwater trout raceways, brackish sea bass earth ponds, and full-seawater marine hatchery tanks. Concrete marine fish tanks are susceptible to chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion over years of saline water exposure — a structural deterioration mechanism that simply does not exist in EPDM-lined facilities.

**What thickness of EPDM is recommended for my fish pond?**

The correct specification depends on substrate type and operational conditions. As a general guide: 0.75 mm for ornamental garden ponds on prepared sandy or clay substrate without vehicle access; 1.0 mm for standard commercial earth ponds on prepared substrate with geotextile underlay; 1.5 mm for rocky or irregular substrates, renovation of existing concrete tanks, or environments with elevated mechanical risk; 2.0 mm for heavy-duty ponds where harvest equipment operates over the liner, extremely rocky substrates, or projects requiring maximum mechanical resilience with long intervals between inspections. Membriko's site assessment determines the correct specification for every project.

**How long after EPDM installation can I introduce fish into the pond?**

A freshly installed and water-filled EPDM pond should run in clean water circulation for a minimum of seven days before fish introduction. This period allows any installation surface residues — adhesive compounds, handling marks — to dilute and flush to undetectable concentrations, and allows the early stages of biological nitrogen cycle establishment in the system. Membriko provides a written pre-stocking protocol with every commercial pond installation, covering water quality targets that should be achieved before fish are introduced: ammonia below 0.5 mg/L, nitrite below 0.1 mg/L, and pH within the appropriate range for the species concerned (typically 7.0 to 8.0 for freshwater species, 7.8 to 8.3 for marine species).
