# Ornamental Pond and Decorative Lake Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Water in the Portuguese Garden — and the Problem with Most Pond Liners

Water has defined the character of Portuguese garden tradition for centuries. The formal lily
ponds of the Quinta da Bacalhôa, the mirrored water tanks of Sintra's palace gardens, the
ornamental lakes of Alentejo hotel grounds, the koi ponds that have become the centrepiece of
suburban villas across the Setúbal Peninsula — ornamental water has always been part of how
Portuguese gardens are designed and experienced. In the contemporary hotel sector, a well-designed
ornamental lake is frequently the most photographed feature on the property, shaping the guest's
first impression of the estate.

But beneath that serene surface, in the vast majority of cases, the waterproofing is failing.
Garden-centre PVC pond liner has stiffened and become brittle after ten years of Portuguese sun.
The concrete basin has cracked — as concrete reliably does — and the pond loses water at a rate
the owner cannot trace. Aquatic plant roots have penetrated the PVC at the marginal shelf. The
koi are showing chronic stress because the plasticisers that have leached from the degrading liner
are interfering with their endocrine system.

Membriko, an EPDM membrane installation specialist based in Pombal in central Portugal, was
established to solve this problem permanently. EPDM pond membrane is not a ten-year solution
or even a twenty-year solution — it is a liner for the full working life of the pond structure,
backed by Membriko's 20-year installation warranty and a documented service life exceeding fifty
years. This page explains, with the same technical directness Membriko applies in all its client
consultations, why EPDM is the correct material for ornamental ponds and decorative lakes of
any scale.

## Why EPDM is the Right Material for Ornamental Ponds

An ornamental pond imposes a specific set of demands on its liner that make it one of the most
technically challenging waterproofing environments. Unlike a swimming pool, which is emptied
periodically for inspection and cleaning, an ornamental lake remains full year-round. The liner
is in continuous contact with living water — with fish, aquatic plants, invertebrates, biofilm,
and the root systems of marginal plants. It is exposed to near-direct UV radiation in shallow
marginal zones. It is subject to root pressure from vigorous aquatic plants growing against
the membrane. It is mechanically stressed by substrate movement resulting from temperature
cycles, soil swelling and the biological activity of the ground below the pond.

No other pond liner material meets all of these demands with the effectiveness of EPDM.

### The Molecular Architecture That Makes the Difference

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic elastomer whose primary polymer chain
consists exclusively of single carbon-to-carbon and carbon-to-hydrogen bonds. This saturated
chain is chemically inert to oxidative attack by UV radiation, free radicals and enzymatic
degradation. There is no chemical degradation pathway to which EPDM is vulnerable under the
conditions found in an ornamental pond.

Compare this with PVC pond liner. PVC in its pure form is a rigid, brittle material that can
only be made flexible enough for pond lining through the addition of 20 to 40 per cent by weight
of plasticisers — typically phthalate esters in older formulations, or adipate, succinate and
citrate esters in newer non-phthalate versions. These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to
the PVC polymer matrix. They are simply dispersed through it, and they migrate progressively
into the pond water over time under the combined effects of heat, UV and microbial activity.
This migration is the root cause of PVC pond liner degradation, and it is also the reason
Membriko does not use PVC for any ornamental pond application that contains fish or other
aquatic fauna.

### Inherent Root Resistance — The Property PVC Cannot Match

Membriko specifies for ornamental pond applications the same EPDM formulation used as root
barrier membrane in green roof construction — a material certified to the FLL (German Landscape
Research Institute) standard and EN 13948 for resistance to root penetration. This certification
is not a marketing claim: it reflects the outcome of standardised test procedures in which the
roots of invasive species including Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed), bamboo and willow are
placed in contact with the membrane for a two-year test period, and penetration is verified
microscopically. EPDM passes. The rhizomes of water lilies, the roots of yellow iris (Iris
pseudacorus), bulrush (Typha latifolia) and common reed (Phragmites australis) cannot penetrate
the Membriko EPDM membrane.

Standard garden-centre PVC pond liner carries no equivalent root resistance certification.
Membriko's site survey visits to older PVC-lined ponds regularly find root penetration at the
marginal shelf — the thinnest and mechanically weakest zone in the liner — in ponds where
vigorous marginal planting has been established for seven to ten years.

## Pond and Water Feature Types

Membriko has direct installation experience across the full range of ornamental water feature
types found in Portugal — from a two-square-metre garden water bowl to a two-thousand-square-metre
hotel lake. Each project is unique in its geometry and context; the EPDM solution is consistent
in its quality.

### Residential Garden Ponds and Water Features

The residential ornamental pond is the most numerous category: the small koi pond at a Setúbal
villa, the formal fountain tank in a Douro wine estate garden, the naturalistic wildlife pond
at an Alentejo quinta, the water channel and cascade in an urban courtyard garden. These features
range from two to one hundred square metres, come in every conceivable shape, and are typically
surrounded by planting that will put progressive root pressure on the liner as the garden matures.

Membriko installs 1.5 mm EPDM membrane for the generality of residential pond projects. The
availability of EPDM membrane in widths up to 15.25 metres means that most residential ponds
can be lined with a single panel, with no internal seam within the pond basin — the most
vulnerable point in any liner system is eliminated by design. The Membriko installation process
includes the fitting of all pond penetration accessories (bottom drains, skimmer units, pipework
sleeves) with flanged EPDM compression fittings that provide a watertight mechanical seal at
every through-membrane penetration.

For ponds containing koi — which represent a significant financial and emotional investment,
and which are acutely sensitive to water quality — Membriko invariably specifies EPDM over
any alternative. The 20-year warranty that Membriko issues with every installation gives the
pond keeper the assurance that the liner will not be the source of future problems.

### Public and Municipal Ornamental Water Features

Public parks and gardens across Portugal's cities and towns contain decorative lakes, formal
reflecting pools, water channels and fountain basins as central elements of their landscape
design. These features are managed by Câmaras Municipais and municipal green space services,
and they require liner materials that can be installed with minimal disruption to public use
and that will function without significant maintenance for many decades.

Membriko is equipped for public sector waterproofing projects, including coordination with
the principal contractor, adaptation of working hours to minimise impact on public access,
and the production of the complete technical and warranty documentation required under public
procurement contracts. The ACS and WRAS certifications of the EPDM membranes Membriko
installs confirm that no chemical compounds migrate from the liner into the water of urban
pond features — a meaningful consideration where those features support wildlife (wildfowl,
herons, amphibians) or are accessible to children.

### Hotel and Resort Ornamental Lakes

The Algarve and Alentejo hotel sector has an established tradition of elaborately landscaped
grounds in which the ornamental lake or koi pond is a defining element of the property's
visual identity. These features must function reliably throughout the commercial season. A
liner failure requiring the draining of a decorative lake in July at a five-star property
is an event with immediate and visible consequences for the guest experience.

Membriko plans hotel and resort pond waterproofing installations for the low season window
— typically October to March — minimising the period during which the water feature is
out of service. The 20-year Membriko warranty for hotel installations is particularly valuable
for properties with bank finance: the warranty period typically spans the asset's loan
amortisation cycle, eliminating unbudgeted liner replacement costs within that financial window.

For hotel lakes of significant area (above 200 m²), Membriko specifies factory-vulcanised
seam panels — large-format membrane sections joined under controlled factory conditions to
produce seam strength equivalent to the parent membrane — for installations where the liner
will be subject to intensive maintenance access and pressure washing.

### Biological Filter Ponds and Reed Beds

Contemporary ornamental pond design increasingly integrates biological filtration zones: reed
bed filters, sedimentation pre-bays, or aquatic plant filter margins incorporated within the
landscape design. These natural biofiltration systems require a liner that does not interfere
with the biological activity of the filter — the nitrifying bacteria, oligochaetes and other
filter organisms are sensitive to dissolved organic compounds.

The EPDM installed by Membriko releases no compounds that interfere with biofiltration. This
total chemical neutrality is the same reason EPDM is the membrane of choice in natural swimming
pools and biopool systems. Membriko has experience integrating the main pond liner with the
biofiltration zone liner in a continuous, single-material waterproofing system, eliminating
any material junction between the two zones.

---

## Fish and Aquatic Plant Safety

Fish safety is the first concern raised in every Membriko consultation with a koi keeper or
ornamental pond owner. The answer is unambiguous: EPDM is the safest pond liner material for
fish-bearing water, for reasons grounded in chemistry rather than marketing.

### The Plasticiser Problem in PVC Pond Liner

Standard garden-centre PVC pond liner contains 20 to 40 per cent by weight of plasticisers —
the additives that make rigid PVC flexible enough to function as a pond liner. Until the mid-2010s,
the dominant plasticiser in European PVC pond liners was DEHP (di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate),
classified by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) as a substance of very high concern (SVHC)
and included on the REACH Authorisation List (Annex XIV) in 2011, owing to its endocrine
disrupting properties, reproductive toxicity and immunotoxicity. DEHP is progressively being
replaced in newer PVC formulations, but with adipate, succinate and citrate plasticisers that
still migrate into warm water.

In a small pond (two to ten cubic metres of water), heavily stocked with fish, in a sun-exposed
location where summer water temperatures can reach 30 to 35°C — conditions entirely normal for
an Alentejo or Algarve garden pond in August — the concentration of plasticisers released from
a degrading PVC liner can reach levels with documented ecotoxicological effects in closed water
systems. Fish showing unexplained reproductive failure, immune suppression or chronic lethargy
in older PVC-lined ponds should prompt inspection of the liner's condition.

EPDM contains no plasticisers of any kind. Its flexibility is intrinsic to the crosslinked
elastomer molecular structure — not derived from mobile additives. This is not a property that
degrades over time. After fifty years of service, EPDM remains plasticiser-free.

### Comparison with Concrete Pond Basins

Traditional concrete ponds present a different but equally important safety issue: untreated
concrete leaches calcium hydroxide, raising water pH to levels between 9 and 12. Freshwater
fish begin to experience acute stress above pH 9 and suffer fatal gill damage above pH 10 to
10.5. The traditional remedy — repeated fill-and-drain cycles over four to eight weeks, or
acid washing — is laborious, often incomplete, and must be repeated as fresh concrete surfaces
are exposed by wear.

A concrete pond re-lined by Membriko with EPDM membrane eliminates the alkalinity leaching
problem entirely. The membrane isolates the concrete from contact with the water. After
installation and filling, the pond can receive fish within 48 to 72 hours — the time required
for water temperature equilibration — with no conditioning or curing period.

### Migration Testing Data — What the Science Shows

The EPDM membranes installed by Membriko are subjected to migration testing under protocols
equivalent to those of the ACS (France) and WRAS (UK) certifications for potable water contact.
Immersion testing in fresh water at 23°C and 60°C shows:

- Total organic carbon (TOC): below detection limit at 23°C; below 0.5 mg/L at 60°C (a
  temperature far above any ornamental pond water in Portugal)
- Aromatic hydrocarbons: not detected
- Heavy metals: not detected above background levels
- Plasticisers: not detected (none present in the formulation)

These results contrast sharply with degraded PVC pond liner in warm water, where plasticiser
migration at 30°C has been measured at 1 to 5 mg/L in closed-system studies — concentrations
with demonstrated ecotoxicological potential.

### Root Resistance — The Certification That Matters for Planted Ponds

Marginal aquatic plants — yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus), bulrush (Typha latifolia),
common reed (Phragmites australis), sedges and water mint — develop extensive horizontal
root systems that grow across the pond substrate, including against and along the pond liner.
In a mature planted pond, the marginal shelf liner is in continuous contact with active root
systems throughout the growing season.

The EPDM membrane installed by Membriko is certified to the FLL standard and EN 13948 for
root resistance — the same certification required for root barrier membranes in green roof
construction. This certification provides documented assurance that even the most vigorous
aquatic plant species cannot penetrate the membrane during its service life. Membriko's
field experience confirms this: on re-lining visits to ponds with failing PVC liners, root
penetration at the marginal shelf is a consistently observed finding in planted ponds over
seven to ten years old.

## Installation Process — Seven Steps to a Permanent Pond

Membriko follows a systematic, documented installation process that eliminates the most common
causes of early failure in ornamental pond waterproofing. Each step has a specific technical
purpose; none is procedural routine.

### Step 1: Technical Site Survey

Membriko conducts a free technical site survey before any proposal. For an ornamental pond
or lake, this survey includes:

- Accurate measurement of all dimensions: length, width, maximum and minimum depth, marginal
  shelf dimensions, bank slope gradients
- Substrate assessment: soil type, presence of stones, roots or sharp materials that could
  puncture the membrane; assessment of groundwater table level (a high water table can create
  upward hydrostatic pressure on the pond liner when the pond is empty)
- Inspection of existing liner (renovation projects): condition of existing PVC or concrete,
  location of known leaks, existing penetrations
- Inventory of all pond fittings: bottom drains, skimmer units, pump inlets and return
  outlets, electrical conduits for submersible lighting or aeration equipment
- Assessment of site access for materials and equipment delivery

This survey is the foundation of Membriko's project-specific proposal. Membriko does not issue
generic per-square-metre estimates without a site visit.

### Step 2: Cut Plan Design and Dimensioning

From the site measurements, Membriko prepares the membrane cut plan. The objective is to
minimise internal seams within the pond basin: each seam represents a point requiring careful
execution and, by definition, is marginally less robust than the continuous membrane. For ponds
with no dimension exceeding 15 metres, it is frequently possible to specify a single EPDM
panel with no internal seam at all. For larger ponds or geometrically complex features requiring
multiple panels, seams are positioned in the lowest-stress zones (flat pond floor, marginal
shelves) and never on slopes or edges.

The cut plan also specifies membrane thickness (1.0 mm for small decorative elements; 1.5 mm
for garden ponds; up to 2.0 mm for large public or hotel lakes with intensive maintenance
access), penetration accessories for every pond fitting, and the edge termination technique
to be used at each section of the pond perimeter.

### Step 3: Substrate Preparation

Substrate preparation is the most consequential step for long-term liner performance. Any
sharp point in contact with the membrane under hydrostatic pressure can, over time and with
substrate movement, create a puncture.

Membriko's preparation works include:

- **Removal of existing liner** (renovation projects): extraction of PVC liner, removal of
  loose stone and concrete projections, grinding of sharp concrete edges
- **Substrate grading**: application of sharp-sand blinding (minimum 50 mm depth) to the
  pond floor and lower banks to create a uniform surface free of point loads
- **Geotextile underlay installation**: where the substrate contains stones, roots or angular
  materials, Membriko installs a 300 g/m² minimum geotextile protection layer beneath the
  membrane to distribute point loads and prevent puncture from substrate intrusion
- **Bank preparation**: excessively steep banks (above 45 degrees) are re-graded to prevent
  membrane sliding before anchoring; unstable bank materials are consolidated with geotextile
  pinning or gravel compaction

### Step 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Installation begins at the deepest point of the pond — the central floor. The EPDM panel is
laid over the geotextile (where specified) and carefully draped to conform to the pond geometry,
without pulling or creating tension at any point. The 400 per cent elongation of EPDM allows
this conformation even over complex curvilinear geometries with multiple changes in curvature.

At the pond floor and on the marginal shelves, Membriko applies immersion-rated contact adhesive
between the EPDM and the prepared substrate, securing the membrane against flotation during
initial filling. On sloped banks, the membrane is bonded progressively from bottom to top in
sections, ensuring the adhesive does not cure before full contact is established.

Where multiple panels are required, seams are made with QuickPrime Plus primer and 150 mm
QuickSeam seaming tape, applied with a silicone roller under uniform pressure to achieve
complete contact throughout the seam width.

### Step 5: Pond Fittings and Penetrations

All pond penetrations — bottom drains, skimmer boxes, pump inlet sleeves, return outlets,
electrical conduits — are sealed with purpose-made EPDM flanged accessories. These comprise
a flanged EPDM fitting and a compression plate that, when bolted together through the membrane,
create a watertight mechanical seal. Membriko does not use mastic sealants or silicone as the
primary seal at any pond penetration: only EPDM compression fittings rated for permanent
immersion are used.

The location of each penetration is marked on the membrane before installation. Membrane
cutting is done with precision, and each cut is immediately followed by fitting of the
corresponding EPDM accessory — the substrate is never left exposed to water through an unsealed
penetration.

### Step 6: Edge Termination and Naturalisation

The edge treatment is the most visually significant step and the one that most determines
whether the finished pond looks natural or artificial. Membriko executes the following edge
termination techniques, alone or in combination depending on the project design:

- **River cobble and stone overlay**: rounded river cobbles or dressed stone bedded on the EPDM
  flap above the waterline; no mortar bond to the membrane (to allow differential movement);
  marginal planting established in gaps between stones
- **Turf edge**: EPDM flap (minimum 600 mm beyond waterline) covered with topsoil and turf;
  low maintenance; organic appearance integrating seamlessly into a grass-dominated garden
- **Timber deck overhang**: hardwood or treated softwood decking extending 50 to 100 mm beyond
  the pond edge, concealing the membrane; EPDM terminates under the deck framing with an
  aluminium anchor profile
- **Planted marginal shelf**: shallow gravel-filled shelf (100 to 200 mm depth) planted with
  marginal aquatic plants; vegetation establishes over the liner flap within one growing season
- **Formal stone coping**: sawn limestone, granite or concrete coping bedded on a concrete
  upstand; EPDM terminates behind the coping with a stainless steel termination bar anchor

### Step 7: Inspection, Filling and Warranty Issue

Following installation completion, Membriko conducts a systematic visual inspection of all
seams and penetrations with photographic documentation. The pond is then filled gradually —
progressive filling distributes hydrostatic pressure incrementally, allowing verification that
the membrane conforms correctly and that there are no uplift points.

After filling, the water level is monitored for 48 hours. Any abnormal drop in level beyond
natural evaporation triggers a detailed investigation. Where required, Membriko uses electronic
leak detection (ELD) equipment to pinpoint any membrane defect with millimetre accuracy.

At project handover, Membriko issues the 20-year installation warranty certificate, the
photographic as-built record, and the EPDM pond membrane maintenance guide.

## Design and Shaping — EPDM Follows Any Contour the Designer Draws

One of the principal reasons landscape architects and garden designers specify EPDM is the
geometric freedom it provides. Unlike preformed GRP shells or cast concrete basins — which
impose fixed shapes dictated by the mould or the formwork — EPDM membrane follows precisely
the shape that has been designed for the pond, whatever that shape may be.

### Organic and Free-Form Geometries

The 400 per cent elongation of EPDM allows the membrane to conform to any curvature — concave,
convex or compound — without bridging, wrinkling or stress concentrations. Membriko has
installation experience in ponds with completely organic outlines: irregular boundaries that
incorporate rock outcrops, tree root systems, natural ground slopes and water channels. The
membrane adapts to the terrain; the terrain does not need to be modified to suit the membrane.

For ponds with any dimension exceeding 15.25 metres — the maximum factory width of a single
EPDM panel — Membriko specifies factory-vulcanised seams: panels joined under controlled
factory conditions to produce joints with strength equivalent to the parent membrane. This
technique allows ornamental lakes of any area to be lined without any compromise in seam quality.

### Marginal Shelves and Variable Depth Profiles

Well-designed ornamental ponds incorporate multiple depth zones: a deep central zone (1.0 to
1.5 m) for fish refuge in summer and winter; shallow marginal shelves (100 to 300 mm) for
aquatic plant establishment; and smooth gradients between the zones. Membriko executes this
profile directly from the excavated form, with pre-formed EPDM inside corner pieces providing
clean, stress-free transitions at the shelf step edges.

### Stream Channels, Cascades and Integrated Water Movement

Ornamental ponds frequently incorporate dynamic water elements: feeding streams, cascade faces,
bog garden overflows. Membriko lines stream channels and cascade surfaces with the same EPDM
membrane as the main pond basin, creating a continuous waterproofing system with no material
junction in the water path. Stone overlay on the stream bed — which conceals the liner entirely
— is coordinated by Membriko with the stone mason or landscape contractor to ensure that no
stone with a sharp or angular edge bears directly on the membrane.

### Raised and Above-Ground Pond Structures

Membriko has experience lining raised ponds constructed on timber frames, brick plinths and
precast concrete structures. The EPDM membrane is clamped at the top of the structure with
a perimeter aluminium anchor profile, and the hydrostatic load is carried by the membrane's
tensile strength and the structural frame. Raised ponds are an increasingly popular option
for terrace gardens and urban courtyard spaces where excavation is not possible.

## Water Quality Advantages of EPDM

The liner material in an ornamental pond is not merely a containment device — it has a direct
and measurable effect on the water quality within the feature.

### Total Chemical Inertness

EPDM adds nothing to the water. There is no calcium hydroxide leaching (as with concrete), no
plasticiser release (as with PVC), no paint film degradation (as with bituminous or epoxy
coatings). The chemical composition of the water in an EPDM-lined pond is determined entirely
by the water source, fish load, plant photosynthetic activity, biological filtration and feeding
regime — not by the liner. For ponds integrating natural biofiltration systems, this total
chemical inertness is fundamental: any compound released by the liner could interfere with the
biofilm organisms and reduce filtration efficiency.

### pH Stability

EPDM has no effect on water pH. The membrane neither acidifies nor alkalinises the water. Pond
pH is determined by the incoming water's carbonate hardness, the fish population's CO₂ output,
and photosynthetic activity — not by the liner. This contrasts sharply with new concrete ponds
and lime-mortar render, both of which elevate pH continuously for months until the alkaline
surfaces are sufficiently weathered.

### Beneficial Biofilm Support

EPDM surfaces support the natural establishment of beneficial nitrifying biofilm — colonies of
Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter bacteria that convert fish-excreted ammonia to nitrite and then
to nitrate, completing the fundamental step of the nitrogen cycle in a balanced pond ecosystem.
This biofilm establishes naturally on the EPDM surface without any surface treatment. The large
surface area of EPDM lining the pond floor and banks provides substantial additional colonisable
surface area for this beneficial biofilm, complementing the biological filtration provided by
external filter media.

## EPDM Compared with PVC, Concrete, Fibre Glass and Preformed Shells

Membriko presents this comparison honestly. Every material has its context of appropriate use,
and the objective is to give the reader accurate information for a well-grounded decision.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | PVC Liner | Concrete + Coating | GRP Shell | Butyl Rubber |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 10–20 years | Variable (coating dependent) | 15–25 years | 15–25 years |
| Fish safety | Excellent — no plasticisers | Moderate — plasticiser migration | Poor initially (pH) / Good after curing | Good | Good |
| Root resistance | Excellent — EN 13948 certified | Poor — not certified | Not applicable | Not applicable | Good |
| Shape freedom | Unlimited | Good | Rigid — cast form only | Rigid — fixed shell | Unlimited |
| UV resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Moderate — degrades with time | Not applicable | Moderate — gel coat chalks | Good |
| Maximum single-piece width | 15.25 m | 6 m (typical) | Not applicable | 5×3 m typical maximum | Up to 10 m |
| 30-year cost index | 100 | 200 (replacement at year 15) | 150 (periodic recoating) | 180 (gel coat refurbishment) | 150 |

Preformed GRP shells offer simplicity for small, standard-shape ponds and require no skilled
substrate preparation. Concrete basins have genuine structural superiority where the pond must
carry external mechanical loads. Butyl rubber (isobutylene-isoprene copolymer) is the closest
technical alternative to EPDM and performs comparably in many applications. Membriko's position
is that EPDM delivers the optimal combination of documented fish safety, root resistance,
shape freedom, UV durability and 50-year service life for professional ornamental pond and
lake waterproofing in Portugal's conditions.

## Edge Finishing and Naturalisation Techniques

The edge detail — the visible transition from the EPDM liner to the landscape above the
waterline — is the most critically visible element of any ornamental pond installation. A
correctly executed edge is invisible: the liner terminates below the stone, below the turf,
below the deck. An incorrectly executed edge exposes the liner to UV degradation, creates
a visually artificial margin, and often fails structurally within a few seasons.

Membriko executes the following edge termination approaches, chosen according to the garden
design brief and the client's landscape context:

### River Cobble and Natural Stone Overlay

The most versatile naturalisation technique for informal and naturalistic ponds: rounded river
cobbles (granite or quartzite, 30 to 60 mm nominal size), split slate or dressed limestone
are placed directly on the extended EPDM flap above the waterline, without mortar bond to the
membrane (allowing differential thermal movement). The stone completely conceals the liner edge
and creates a natural shoreline appearance. Marginal plants can be established between stones
immediately after installation. In Portuguese gardens, this technique integrates naturally with
the local cobblestone and granite vernacular.

### Grass and Turf Edge

For ponds set within a lawn or meadow area, the EPDM flap is extended a minimum of 600 mm
beyond the design waterline and covered with a layer of topsoil seeded or turfed with the
surrounding lawn species. The grass grows to the water's edge, creating the gentle, informal
pond margin characteristic of English landscape garden tradition — an aesthetic with a dedicated
following among Portuguese rural and quinta property owners. The minimum flap width of 600 mm
is specified by Membriko to prevent soil and turf from slipping into the pond during heavy
rainfall events.

### Timber Deck Overhang

A hardwood (IPE, teak, cumaru) or pressure-treated softwood deck structure extending 50 to
100 mm beyond the pond edge conceals the liner completely and creates a clean, contemporary
interface between garden and water. Membriko terminates the EPDM membrane beneath the outer
deck bearer with an aluminium anchor profile, leaving sufficient technical clearance for
thermal deflection of the timber structure. This technique is particularly appropriate for
urban terrace gardens and contemporary landscape designs where a natural stone edge would
appear inconsistent with the design language.

### Planted Marginal Shelf with Gravel

The shallow EPDM-lined marginal shelf (100 to 200 mm depth) filled with washed gravel (20 to
40 mm nominal) and planted with aquatic marginal species is Membriko's recommended approach
for ponds designed to integrate biological filtration or to create maximum wildlife habitat
value. Iris pseudacorus, Typha latifolia, Carex pendula, Mentha aquatica and other common
Portuguese marginal species are planted directly into the gravel, with roots resting on the
EPDM surface. Within one growing season, the vegetation covers the gravel and naturalises
the margin completely. The EPDM root resistance ensures the liner remains intact as the plant
root systems develop.

## Maintenance

One of the most practical advantages of EPDM for ornamental pond owners is the near-absence
of liner-specific maintenance requirements. Membriko provides every client with a written
maintenance guide at project completion.

### Routine Inspection

Membriko recommends an annual visual inspection of the EPDM membrane, ideally at the beginning
of spring before aquatic plant growth obscures the marginal areas:

- **Waterline band**: the zone between 100 mm below and 200 mm above the maximum water level
  receives the highest UV dose and the greatest thermal cycling; check for any sign of cracking,
  unusual surface hardness, or membrane lifting
- **Penetration points**: bottom drain, skimmer and pipework penetration accessories should
  be checked for any sign of loosening or separation from the membrane
- **Edge termination**: confirm that cobble, gravel or turf overlying the EPDM flap has not
  shifted to expose the membrane; reposition any displaced material

Water quality management — filtration, algae control, fish feeding — is independent of the
membrane and follows standard ornamental pond best practice.

### Cleaning

EPDM membrane can be cleaned with:
- Nylon-bristled pond scrubbing brushes (no metal bristles)
- Pond vacuum cleaners with rubber or nylon suction heads (no metal)
- Pressure washing at up to 150 bar

Standard ornamental pond algaecides including copper sulphate and quaternary ammonium compound
(QAC) formulations are fully compatible with EPDM membrane. Copper sulphate may leave a blue
mineral stain on light-coloured surfaces, but has no effect on black or dark grey EPDM.

### Repair

If the membrane sustains a localised mechanical puncture — from a garden fork during aquatic
plant division, or from a sharp stone during stream clearance — repair is straightforward:

- **Repair with water level reduced**: lower the water level until the damaged area is exposed;
  clean and dry the area around the damage; apply an EPDM patch using QuickSeam tape and
  QuickPrime Plus primer; allow 30 minutes cure time; re-fill. Total repair time for a single
  puncture is typically 2 to 4 hours plus filling time.
- **What to avoid**: cutting tools, metal stakes or anchors placed through the liner; metal-

## Portuguese Climate Considerations

EPDM is in active service in ornamental ponds across climates from the Arctic to the Arabian
Gulf. Portugal's range of climatic conditions — from the Atlantic northwest to the continental
Alentejo interior — falls comfortably within EPDM's operational envelope, but the specific
Portuguese conditions are worth understanding for correct liner specification.

### Summer Heat in the Alentejo and Algarve Interior

In the Alentejo and Algarve, exposed EPDM membrane above the waterline can reach surface
temperatures of 70 to 80°C during July and August — recorded via infrared thermometer on
south-facing dark surfaces in full sun. EPDM's continuous service temperature in air is up
to 130°C. This condition presents no risk to the membrane.

PVC pond liner, by contrast, begins to soften and permanently deform above approximately
50 to 55°C — a temperature that is reached on the exposed marginal sections of a shallow
garden pond in full sun during an Alentejo heat wave. The deformation of PVC at these
temperatures creates localised stress that accelerates liner failure at the affected zone.

The temperature of the water itself — which is what matters for fish welfare — is determined
by pond depth, shading, aeration and circulation. Membriko can advise on pond design features
that moderate summer water temperature in hot Portuguese climates: minimum depth requirements
for the central zone, appropriate shading strategies, and recirculation with surface aeration.

### Winter Cold in the Northern Interior

In the Beira Alta plateau, Trás-os-Montes and the Serra da Estrela foothills, overnight
temperatures below -10°C are normal occurrences in January and February. Ice formation in
an ornamental pond creates lateral pressure on the banks and upward pressure on the floor
liner as the ice mass expands.

EPDM remains fully flexible down to -45°C — it does not become brittle at any temperature
encountered in continental Portugal, and it absorbs freeze-thaw mechanical stresses through
its elongation rather than cracking under them. Standard garden-centre PVC pond liner can
become brittle at temperatures below -5 to -10°C, and fracture during thaw events when the
ice applies sudden differential pressure to the liner before melting. This is a meaningful
distinction for pond owners in Portugal's colder inland regions.

### UV Intensity Across Portugal

Portugal receives 2,500 to 3,100 hours of sunshine per year in the south and 1,800 to 2,400
hours in the north — among the highest values in continental Europe, and significantly higher
than the climates in which most European garden pond liner products are developed and tested.
A liner specified from UV resistance data measured in Germany or the Netherlands will experience
substantially higher UV doses in the Algarve or the Alentejo than those data anticipate.

EPDM's UV resistance margins are sufficient even for the highest Portuguese UV conditions: the
3,000-hour xenon arc test data from which Membriko's 50-year service life projections are
derived represent a conservative estimate for Portuguese conditions, where actual UV intensity
produces slower ageing per hour than the xenon arc test protocol assumes.

## Landscape Architect and Garden Designer Integration

Membriko regularly works with landscape architects and garden designers as a specialist
waterproofing subcontractor on ornamental pond and lake projects. This collaboration produces
the best technical and aesthetic outcomes when it begins during the design development phase,
before excavation starts.

### What Membriko Provides to the Design Team

- **Complete technical documentation**: EPDM membrane technical data sheets, Declaration of
  Performance (DoP) per EN 13956, ACS and WRAS certification documentation, installation
  methodology statement — all documents required for inclusion in contract specification
  packages and public project licensing processes
- **Cut plan and construction details**: Membriko can prepare dimensioned membrane layout
  plans and edge termination section details for inclusion in the landscape architect's
  construction drawings
- **Edge detail design collaboration**: the transition details between EPDM membrane and
  surrounding materials (stone, deck, concrete, permeable paving) are coordinated by Membriko
  with the design team to achieve both watertightness and the intended visual outcome
- **Site programme coordination**: Membriko schedules membrane installation within the overall
  construction programme, coordinating with the civil contractor, stone mason, electrician
  and irrigation specialist

For public procurement projects and heritage garden restorations, Membriko can provide
documented references for comparable completed works and the quality assurance documentation
required for contractor qualification submissions.

### Working with the Portuguese Landscape Architecture Profession

Membriko is familiar with the specification standards and documentation requirements of the
principal Portuguese landscape architecture practices (APAP members) and of the public bodies
responsible for maintaining Portugal's heritage gardens — including Parques de Sintra-Monte
da Lua and the Câmaras Municipais managing classified historic park estates. Membriko's
documentation is prepared in formats compatible with the requirements of both private and
public sector project specifications.

## Frequently Asked Questions about EPDM Ornamental Ponds

**Is EPDM genuinely safe for koi and ornamental fish, or is this a marketing claim?**

It is chemistry, not marketing. EPDM contains no plasticisers — the property that makes PVC
a concern for fish-bearing water. EPDM migration testing in fresh water immersion at 23°C
and 60°C detects no organic compounds above the detection limit at normal pond water temperatures.
The European koi-keeping community — particularly in the Netherlands, Germany and the United
Kingdom, where pond-grade EPDM has been in use since the 1970s — has thirty-plus years of
positive empirical evidence from breeding ponds, show ponds and garden display ponds. Membriko
recommends EPDM for every ornamental pond containing fish of any species or value.

**Can the roots of aquatic plants penetrate the Membriko EPDM membrane?**

No. The EPDM installed by Membriko is certified to the FLL standard and EN 13948 for root
penetration resistance — the same certification level required for root barrier membranes
in green roof construction. Water lily rhizomes, iris roots, bulrush roots and Phragmites
root systems cannot penetrate the membrane during its service life. This is the critical
technical distinction between Membriko's EPDM and standard garden-centre PVC pond liner,
which carries no root resistance certification and which Membriko regularly finds to have
been penetrated in mature planted ponds.

**Can I reline an old concrete pond with EPDM without demolishing it?**

Yes — this is one of the most common ornamental pond projects in Membriko's portfolio.
EPDM's 400 per cent elongation allows the membrane to bridge existing cracks in the concrete
without compromising its waterproofing integrity. The concrete needs to be structurally stable
— not collapsing — and free of sharp projections that could puncture the new liner. In the
majority of cases, EPDM relining is substantially less expensive and less disruptive than
demolishing and reconstructing a concrete pond. Membriko assesses the concrete condition at
the site survey and advises on any preparatory works needed before membrane installation.

**What thickness of EPDM does Membriko specify for a garden pond?**

For garden ponds and ornamental features of standard residential scale (2 to 100 m²), Membriko
specifies 1.5 mm EPDM as the standard. For small decorative elements under 2 m² (water channels,
water walls, stream sections), 1.0 mm may be appropriate. For large public or hotel lakes
above 200 m² with intensive maintenance activity (pressure washing, wading access for maintenance
staff), 2.0 mm is specified. The precise specification is always determined by the Membriko
technical site survey — not by a catalogue matrix.

**Can I install EPDM pond liner myself, or does it need a professional?**

For small garden ponds under 10 m² with no penetrations, DIY EPDM installation is achievable
for a careful and methodical homeowner using the correct materials and following the manufacturer's
guidance. For larger ponds, ponds containing koi or other valuable fish, ponds with multiple
penetrations (bottom drains, skimmer units), ponds with complex geometry, and any project
where Membriko's 20-year warranty is required, professional installation by Membriko is
recommended. The edge termination and penetration sealing steps are the most performance-critical
and the most commonly executed incorrectly in DIY installations.

**What colour is EPDM pond liner — can it be any colour other than black?**

Pond-grade EPDM is available in black and dark grey. No light-coloured EPDM pond liner is
commercially available: the carbon black that provides EPDM's UV resistance is also responsible
for its dark colouration, and reducing the carbon black content to produce a light colour would
compromise UV stability. In practice, the dark liner is an aesthetic advantage for most ornamental
pond applications: water over a dark liner appears deeper and more natural, creates a mirror
effect reflecting the surrounding garden, and is the preferred choice of landscape architects
working on high-value residential and hotel projects. The most visually striking ornamental
ponds in contemporary Portuguese landscape design — the dark reflective surfaces so effective
in the Alentejo light — are EPDM-lined.

**How long does installation take, and when can fish be introduced?**

A garden pond of 20 to 50 m² with standard substrate preparation typically takes one to three
days from substrate preparation to edge termination completion, depending on geometric complexity
and the specified edge finishing techniques. Filling can begin immediately after installation
completion. After the pond is filled, Membriko monitors the level for 48 hours before confirming
watertightness. For ponds intended to hold koi, a further 48 to 72 hours of water temperature
equilibration is recommended before introducing fish. Total elapsed time from start of preparation
to fish introduction is typically four to six days.

**What warranty does Membriko provide for ornamental pond and lake waterproofing?**

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty for all ornamental pond and lake waterproofing
work carried out with EPDM membrane. This warranty covers all seams, penetration details and
edge terminations executed by Membriko, and is supplementary to the EPDM membrane manufacturer's
product warranty. The 5-year statutory defects liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code
(Art. 1225) also applies to all Membriko installations. The warranty certificate, together with
the photographic as-built documentation and maintenance guide, is delivered to the client at
project handover.
