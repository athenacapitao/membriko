# Playground Surfaces — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Playground surfacing with EPDM occupies a distinct market position within Membriko's portfolio:
it is the application where the primary value proposition is child safety — specifically the
prevention of serious head injury from falls — rather than waterproofing. The decision-maker
is emotionally engaged in a way that no roofing or civil application achieves: parents, school
headteachers, municipal park managers, and recreation directors all share a visceral concern
for the children who use the surfaces they procure.

The page must do three things simultaneously:

1. **Establish technical authority on EN 1177 and HIC** — this is the safety science that
   underpins every specification decision. Decision-makers who have done any research will
   know these acronyms; those who have not will be educated by Membriko's explanation.
   Either way, technical command creates trust.

2. **Address the diversity of procurement contexts** — a Câmara Municipal tendering a public
   park differs from a private school choosing a playground surface differs from a condominium
   specifying a children's area. The page must serve all three with relevant content.

3. **Differentiate EPDM from legacy alternatives** — rubber mulch, sand, and artificial grass
   are the competitors. The comparison must be honest, data-driven, and focused on total cost
   of ownership, safety performance retention over time, and accessibility.

The SEO target combines two search clusters: the Portuguese municipal/institutional cluster
("pavimento parque infantil EPDM", "piso borracha parque infantil") and the pan-European/English
professional cluster ("playground EPDM surface", "EN 1177 playground surface Portugal").

## Section 1: Introduction — Child Safety and Playground Design

**Purpose:** Establish the safety imperative and Membriko's position as the technically
authoritative supplier of certified playground surfacing.

**Content:**
- Open with the context: a child falls from climbing equipment. The question is not whether
  falls happen — they always do — but whether the surface underneath absorbs enough energy to
  prevent serious head injury. This is the fundamental purpose of playground surfacing, and
  it is a question answered by science, not by appearance.
- Portugal's playground regulatory landscape: Decreto-Lei 379/97 and its references to EN 1176
  and EN 1177 — certified impact-attenuating surface is not optional for public playgrounds.
- Membriko's position: based in Pombal, Membriko supplies and installs EN 1177-certified EPDM
  playground surfaces for municipalities, schools, condominiums, and private clients across
  central Portugal and nationally.
- Stat block: HIC < 1,000 certified / Critical Fall Height up to 3.0 m / 15-20 year service
  life / accessible for wheelchair users
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Orçamento para Parque Infantil"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Playground Surfaces

**Purpose:** Technical case for EPDM over alternatives — energy absorption chemistry,
UV stability, colour retention, accessibility.

**Content:**
- The energy absorption mechanism: EPDM rubber's viscoelastic behaviour under impact load —
  the material deforms, storing energy, and recovers slowly enough to prevent the energy spike
  that causes head injury. The rate of deformation, not just the depth of deformation, is what
  protects.
- Why EPDM outperforms alternatives on every durable metric: UV stability vs SBR, colour
  retention vs painted surfaces, accessibility vs loose-fill, microplastic absence vs synthetic turf
- Physical properties table:
  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Critical Fall Height (typical tile range) | 0.6 m – 3.0 m | EN 1177:2018 |
  | HIC at CFH | < 1,000 | EN 1177:2018 |
  | Surface temperature (summer, shaded) | < 50°C | — |
  | Colour retention | Delta-E < 3 at 2,000 hrs UV | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Slip resistance | Class R10-R11 | DIN 51130 |
  | Service life | 15-20 years (wearing course) | — |
  | Accessibility compliance | Yes — firm and stable surface | ASTM F1951 |

## Section 3: Surface Types — Poured-in-Place, Tiles, and Mats

**Purpose:** Explain the three product formats so that decision-makers understand which
is appropriate for their project context and budget.

**Content:** Three format cards.

**Poured-in-Place EPDM (Sistema Bicamada Moldado In Situ)**
- Construction: SBR base layer (recycled rubber) + EPDM wearing course (pigmented, aliphatic PU binder)
- Advantages: seamless surface, bespoke colour combinations and inlaid graphics, ideal for
  large areas and complex geometries, lowest surface discontinuity (no joints)
- Typical thickness: 40-100 mm total (base + 12-15 mm EPDM wearing course)
- CFH: up to 3.0 m depending on system depth
- Best for: large municipal playgrounds, school playgrounds, custom graphic designs

**EPDM Safety Tiles (Lajes de Segurança em EPDM)**
- Construction: factory-manufactured tiles, 30-100 mm thickness, uniform EPDM throughout
  or EPDM-over-SBR composite
- Advantages: factory quality control, individual tile replaceability, faster installation,
  easier to achieve specific CFH with tested tile thickness
- Typical sizes: 500 × 500 mm, 1,000 × 1,000 mm, custom
- CFH: certified per tile thickness (25 mm → 0.6 m, up to 100 mm → 3.0 m)
- Best for: smaller areas, areas where tile replacement is anticipated, budget-constrained projects

**EPDM Impact Mats (Tapetes de Segurança em EPDM)**
- Construction: thick pre-cut EPDM panels, 40-150 mm, for specific equipment impact zones
- Use case: targeted protection under swings, at slide exits, under climbing wall descents
- Advantage: lowest cost for partial-area protection
- Best for: supplementary protection to existing surfacing, phased installations

## Section 4: Impact Attenuation — EN 1177 and Critical Fall Height

**Purpose:** Educate decision-makers on the safety science and establish Membriko's
technical credentials through a clear, authoritative explanation.

**Content:**
- What Head Injury Criterion (HIC) measures: the integral of the acceleration-time curve during
  impact — a measure of the peak energy the brain would experience in a fall. HIC > 1,000
  correlates with serious head injury risk; EN 1177 requires HIC < 1,000 at the CFH.
- What Critical Fall Height (CFH) is: the maximum drop height at which the surface achieves
  HIC < 1,000, determined by standardised drop tests with a calibrated headform. Must equal
  or exceed the height of the highest accessible point of any play equipment on the surface.
- Table: EPDM surface thickness vs Critical Fall Height
  | Tile Thickness | Typical CFH | Typical Equipment |
  |---|---|---|
  | 25 mm | 0.6 m | Benches, low balance beams |
  | 40 mm | 1.0 m | Low climbing frames, spring riders |
  | 65 mm | 1.5 m | Standard swings, climbing frames |
  | 80 mm | 2.0 m | Higher climbing equipment |
  | 100 mm | 2.5-3.0 m | Large climbing structures |
- EN 1177 certification: what documentation Membriko provides — Declaration of Performance,
  CE marking, third-party test reports from accredited laboratory

## Section 8: Drainage Under Playground Surfaces

**Purpose:** Address a technical concern that surfaces often raise among specifiers and clients.

**Content:**
- Why drainage matters for EN 1177 compliance: waterlogged base layer can reduce effective
  CFH; ponding creates slip hazard and biological contamination
- Drainage design approach: minimum 1% subbase fall to perimeter channels; open-cell SBR
  base construction; gap drainage in tile systems
- Impermeable substrates (concrete school courtyards): perimeter drainage channels, drainage
  grates integrated in the surface layout
- Membriko's site survey process: drainage assessment is always included; solution is designed
  before installation, not retrofitted
- Maintenance of drainage function: annual inspection recommendation; pressure washing maintains
  open-cell drainage paths in PIP systems

**Purpose:** Demonstrate low total cost of ownership vs alternatives.

**Content:**
- Routine maintenance: periodic pressure washing with water (no chemicals required); brushing
  of surface to remove leaf litter and debris; inspection of perimeter profiles and drainage
- Annual inspection recommendation: visual check of surface integrity, impact zone boundaries,
  edge profiles; repeat EN 1177 thickness measurement if wear is suspected
- Repair: damaged areas of PIP surface can be patched with fresh PIP material; individual
  tiles can be replaced without disturbing adjacent area
- What to avoid: metal cleaning tools; sharp objects; petroleum-based solvents near surface
- Documentation: Membriko provides maintenance log template for public playgrounds
  required under Portuguese regulations

## Section 11: Portuguese Playground Safety Regulations

**Purpose:** Complete the regulatory picture for public bodies and institutional clients.

**Content:**
- Decreto-Lei n.º 379/97 (as amended): principal legal instrument; requires EN 1176/EN 1177
  compliance for all public playgrounds; operator liability for maintenance
- EN 1176:2017 — equipment safety standard (context for CFH requirement)
- EN 1177:2018 — surface impact attenuation standard (test methodology, CFH, HIC threshold)
- Municipal licensing: playground construction in public spaces requires Câmara Municipal approval;
  EN 1177 certification documentation typically required at the licensing stage
- Inspection obligations: public playground operators must maintain inspection records;
  Membriko provides initial certification and can support ongoing compliance
- Private playgrounds (condominiums, schools): subject to Decreto-Lei 379/97 if accessible to
  children of the public; best practice is EN 1177 compliance even for entirely private spaces

---

## Section 12: Accessibility Compliance

**Purpose:** Address the inclusive design requirement that is increasingly mandated in
Portuguese public space specifications.

**Content:**
- EU and Portuguese legal context: Decreto-Lei 163/2006 (accessibility in public spaces);
  European Accessibility Act (implementation 2025); UN CRPD (ratified by Portugal)
- How EPDM surfaces meet accessibility requirements: firm and stable surface (wheelchair
  accessible); low rolling resistance; flush transitions; cross-slope ≤ 2%
- Inclusive playground design: EPDM as the only surface material that simultaneously achieves
  EN 1177 safety certification and accessibility compliance
- Accessible route design: Membriko's installation includes continuous accessible pathways
  from the playground entrance to all accessible equipment
- Documentation: Declaration of Conformity for accessibility

## Section 13: UV and Weather Durability in Portugal

**Purpose:** Address the specific Portuguese climate challenge and demonstrate long-term value.

**Content:**
- Portugal's UV intensity by region: GHI 1,600-2,300 kWh/m²/year; one of Europe's highest
  solar irradiance environments; playground surfaces receive full unshaded exposure
- EPDM's UV performance: saturated polymer backbone (intrinsic UV stability); aliphatic PU
  binder in wearing course (non-yellowing, UV-stable); inorganic pigments (UV-stable colour)
- Comparison: SBR-only surfaces (significant surface hardening within 5 years); artificial
  grass (fibre brittleness and microplastic generation within 8-12 years)
- Weather cycling: EPDM's flexibility through -20°C to +70°C temperature range; no
  cracking from thermal cycling; no delamination from freeze-thaw (relevant to Serra da
  Estrela, Serra do Gerês, and higher-altitude sites)
- Expected service life in Portuguese conditions: 15-20 years for the EPDM wearing course;
  SBR base layer theoretically unlimited; tile systems may achieve 20+ years with periodic
  tile replacement in high-traffic areas

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales objections.

1. **Que espessura de pavimento EPDM preciso para o equipamento do meu parque infantil?**
   The surface thickness is determined by the Critical Fall Height (CFH) requirement, which
   equals the height of the highest accessible point on any play equipment. Membriko surveys
   the equipment and specifies the correct system thickness — typically 40-100 mm for standard
   playground equipment. Certification must be from an accredited laboratory per EN 1177:2018.

2. **O pavimento EPDM cumpre os requisitos do Decreto-Lei 379/97?**
   Yes. EPDM playground surfacing certified to EN 1177:2018 satisfies the surface safety
   requirements of Decreto-Lei 379/97 and its associated technical standards. Membriko provides
   the Declaration of Performance, CE marking and third-party test certification required for
   municipal licensing and compliance documentation.

3. **Qual é a diferença entre o sistema bicamada e as lajes de EPDM?**
   Poured-in-place (PIP) two-layer systems are applied wet on site — the SBR base layer and
   EPDM wearing course are mixed and trowelled on the substrate. Seamless, customisable, ideal
   for large areas and bespoke graphics. EPDM tiles are factory-manufactured units installed
   with adhesive — faster installation, individual tile replaceability, consistent factory quality.
   Membriko recommends the most appropriate system for each project after site assessment.

4. **O pavimento EPDM é acessível para crianças em cadeira de rodas?**
   Yes. EPDM poured-in-place and tile surfaces are firm, stable and wheelchair-accessible,
   meeting the requirements of Decreto-Lei 163/2006 and the guidance on accessible playground
   design. Unlike loose-fill surfaces (sand, rubber mulch), EPDM does not create resistance
   for wheelchair users and maintains a continuous accessible route from the playground entrance
   to accessible equipment.

5. **Quanto tempo dura um pavimento EPDM num parque infantil exterior em Portugal?**
   The EPDM wearing course of a poured-in-place system has a typical service life of 15-20
   years under Portuguese outdoor conditions. The SBR base layer has an effectively unlimited
   service life. EPDM tile systems can achieve 20+ years with replacement of individual tiles
   in high-traffic areas. This compares favourably with artificial grass (8-12 years) and
   loose-fill surfaces which require continuous replenishment.

6. **É possível criar grafismos ou desenhos no pavimento EPDM?**
   Yes. Multi-colour zone layouts and inlaid graphic elements — hopscotch, number tracks,
   compass roses, animal shapes, bespoke patterns — are achievable with poured-in-place EPDM
   systems by casting different colour EPDM areas adjacent to each other or by routing and
   infilling contrasting EPDM material. Inlaid graphics are permanent, flush with the surface,
   and present no trip hazard.

7. **O EPDM aquece muito no verão? É seguro para crianças pequenas?**
   EPDM surfaces reach lower temperatures than artificial grass under direct sun. Synthetic
   turf surfaces can reach 60-80°C in Portuguese summer conditions — a documented burn risk.
   EPDM surfaces in direct summer sun typically reach 45-55°C, which is warm but significantly
   safer. For playgrounds with full sun exposure, Membriko recommends lighter-coloured EPDM
   (grey, beige, green) which absorb less solar radiation than dark colours.

8. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para pavimentos de parques infantis?**
   Membriko provides a 10-year installation warranty on poured-in-place EPDM playground
   surfaces and a 5-year warranty on EPDM tile installations, covering defects in materials
   and workmanship. This is supplementary to the manufacturer's product warranty. Membriko
   also provides the EN 1177 certification documentation required for regulatory compliance
   at project handover.
