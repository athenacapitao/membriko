# EPDM Playground Surfaces — Certified Safety Surfacing

## Child Safety and Playground Design

A child falls. This is not an unlikely event — it is a statistical certainty on any active
playground. EN 1176, the European standard for playground equipment safety, begins from this
premise: falls are part of play, and the purpose of playground surfacing is not to prevent
children from moving freely, but to absorb sufficient energy so that when a fall happens, the
probability of serious head injury is acceptably low. This is the science of impact attenuation
— and it is the science that Membriko applies to every playground surface project.

Membriko, based in Pombal in central Portugal, supplies and installs EN 1177:2018-certified
EPDM playground surfaces for local councils, schools, condominiums, and private clients across
central Portugal and nationally. EPDM playground surfacing is not simply the best-performing
impact attenuation material available — it is also the only material that simultaneously
achieves EN 1177 safety certification, wheelchair accessibility, 15-20 year service life under
direct UV exposure, and the ability to integrate permanent multi-colour graphics and play
markings into the surface. It is the complete solution.

Portuguese playground law — Decreto-Lei n.º 379/97 of 27 December — requires that all publicly
accessible playgrounds have impact-attenuating surfaces that comply with the requirements of EN
1176 and EN 1177. Local councils, schools, and public space managers bear legal responsibility
for maintaining certified safety surfacing in serviceable condition. Membriko provides both the
certified surface and the complete technical documentation — Declaration of Performance, CE
marking, and third-party laboratory test reports — required for municipal licensing and regulatory
inspection.

## Why EPDM for Playground Surfaces

EPDM rubber is the material of choice for playground safety surfacing because its viscoelastic
behaviour under dynamic loading corresponds precisely to what EN 1177 requires of an impact-
attenuating surface: rapid deformation under impact (to absorb the kinetic energy of the fall)
and controlled recovery (slow enough to prevent the acceleration transmitted to the head from
exceeding the injury threshold). This is not about surface softness to the touch — it is about
the physics of energy management during a dynamic impact event.

Against every other available material, EPDM offers the unique combination of:

**Certified safety performance that remains stable over time.** The HIC (Head Injury Criterion)
of an EPDM surface does not deteriorate in the first year of use as happens with loose-fill
surfaces (bark, rubber mulch, sand) that lose depth through displacement during normal play.
A Membriko EPDM installation maintains its certified Critical Fall Height throughout its entire
service life, as long as the thickness is preserved — which the polyurethane-bonded construction
ensures by design.

**Universal accessibility.** The firm and stable surface of EPDM is wheelchair-accessible and
usable by children and adults with limited mobility — a legal requirement under Decreto-Lei
163/2006 and European inclusive design guidance. Loose-fill surfaces (sand, bark, rubber mulch)
cannot meet this requirement and create effective exclusion of children with motor disabilities.

**UV resistance and chromatic stability.** Portugal has one of the highest solar irradiance
levels in continental Europe — 1,600 to 2,300 kWh/m² per year depending on the region. Playground
surfaces are exposed to direct sunlight with minimal shade throughout their service life. EPDM,
with its saturated polymer backbone and inorganic pigments incorporated throughout the granule,
maintains colour and structural integrity for 15 to 20 years in this environment. Synthetic grass
fibres degrade within 8-12 years, generating microplastic particles. SBR surfaces without an
EPDM wearing course harden and discolour under intense UV exposure within 3-5 years.

### Physical Properties of EPDM for Playground Surfacing

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Critical Fall Height (HIC < 1,000) | 0.6 m – 3.0 m | EN 1177:2018 |
| Total system thickness | 25 mm – 100 mm | — |
| Slip resistance | Class R10-R11 | DIN 51130 |
| Colour retention | Delta-E < 3 at 2,000 hrs UV | EN ISO 4892-3 |
| Surface temperature (direct sun) | < 55°C (light colours) | — |
| Wheelchair accessibility | Yes — firm and stable surface | ASTM F1951 |
| Service life of wearing course | 15-20 years | — |
| Abrasion resistance | Class A | EN ISO 4649 |
| CE marking | Yes | EN 1177:2018 |

Membriko dimensions every surface system from the Critical Fall Height requirement of the
installed equipment. There is no single standard solution — there is the correct solution for
each project, determined by the technical survey.

## Surface Types — Poured-in-Place, Tiles, and Safety Mats

Membriko works with all three EPDM playground surface formats, selecting the most appropriate
system for each project based on area, equipment, budget, and design requirements.

### Poured-in-Place EPDM (PIP Two-Layer System)

The poured-in-place system is the reference solution for large areas and for projects requiring
bespoke graphics, multiple colour zones, or irregular geometries. It is produced directly on
site in two stages:

**Base layer (recycled SBR):** recycled styrene-butadiene rubber granules, blended with
single-component polyurethane binder and trowel-applied over the prepared substrate. This layer
provides the majority of the total system thickness and is responsible for primary impact energy
absorption. Typical thickness: 25-80 mm depending on the Critical Fall Height required.

**Wearing course (EPDM):** pigmented EPDM granules (1.0-4.0 mm grading), blended with aliphatic
polyurethane binder (UV-stable, non-yellowing), trowel-applied over the cured base layer.
Thickness: 12-15 mm. This layer defines the surface colour, texture, slip resistance, and UV
stability of the system.

The result is a seamless, jointless surface that can incorporate multiple colour zones, inlaid
graphic elements in contrasting EPDM tones, and permanent play markings. Membriko works with
landscape architects and playground designers to develop bespoke colour layouts that make each
playground unique.

**Best for:** large municipal parks, school playgrounds, projects with integrated graphics,
irregular geometries.

### EPDM Safety Tiles

EPDM safety tiles are factory-manufactured panels of uniform thickness and standard dimensions
(typically 500 × 500 mm or 1,000 × 1,000 mm), installed with polyurethane adhesive on the
prepared substrate. Each tile has a manufacturer-certified thickness and Critical Fall Height —
which simplifies specification: Membriko selects the tile thickness that corresponds to the CFH
requirement determined by the equipment inventory.

The fundamental operational advantage of tiles is individual replaceability: if a tile is damaged
by mechanical action (vandalism, heavy object impact), it can be removed and replaced without
disturbing the surrounding surface. For high-traffic areas or contexts where vandalism is a real
concern, this point-repair capability represents a significant economic advantage over the service
life of the installation.

**Best for:** smaller areas, installations where tile replacement is anticipated, projects with
shorter installation timescales, budget-constrained schemes.

### EPDM Safety Mats

Safety mats are pre-cut EPDM panels of high thickness (40-150 mm) for covering specific high-impact
zones: beneath swings, at slide exits, at the base of climbing walls. They are the lowest-cost
solution for targeted protection of high-impact zones and can be used to supplement existing
surfacing or as a first phase of a phased installation.

Membriko specifies safety mats with independent EN 1177 certification for each thickness,
ensuring that the stated Critical Fall Height is verified by accredited laboratory testing —
not an estimate.

---

## Impact Attenuation — EN 1177 and Critical Fall Height

The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) is the central metric of EN 1177:2018. It is calculated from
the acceleration-time curve recorded when a calibrated test headform (mass 4.6 kg) is dropped
in free fall onto the surface from a specified height. HIC integrates the acceleration over the
time interval that maximises the result — it is essentially a measure of the impact energy
transmitted to the head.

The maximum permissible threshold for playground surfacing is HIC = 1,000. A HIC value above
1,000 corresponds to a statistically unacceptable probability of serious head injury. The
standard requires that the surface achieves HIC < 1,000 for falls from the highest accessible
point of the play equipment — which defines the **Critical Fall Height (CFH)** required of the
surface.

### Relationship Between System Thickness and CFH

| Tile Thickness (or Total System Depth) | Typical CFH | Typical Equipment |
|---|---|---|
| 25 mm | 0.6 m | Benches, low balance beams |
| 40 mm | 1.0 m | Low climbing frames, spring riders |
| 65 mm | 1.5 m | Standard swings, medium climbing frames |
| 80 mm | 2.0 m | Higher climbing equipment |
| 100 mm | 2.5-3.0 m | Large climbing structures, climbing walls |

The relationship between thickness and CFH depends on the specific system formulation and must
be verified by accredited laboratory testing — the values above are indicative figures
representative of standard-quality European market products.

Membriko always dimensions the system based on the specific equipment inventory of each project.
The technical site visit includes measurement of the height of every accessible point on every
piece of equipment and calculation of the minimum CFH required per zone according to EN 1176-1:2017.
Generic default values are never used — dimensioning is project-specific.

### EN 1177 Certification Documentation

For every playground surface project, Membriko provides:
- Declaration of Performance (DoP) from the system manufacturer, with certified CFH and HIC values
- CE marking of the system (mandatory for construction products under EU Regulation 305/2011)
- Test reports from accredited laboratory (to EN 1177:2018)
- Photographic as-built record of the completed installation

This documentation is delivered to the client at project completion and forms the compliance
file required for municipal licensing and regulatory inspection.

## Installation Process

Membriko follows a structured, documented installation process from technical survey to
certification handover. Every step has a specific safety or installation quality purpose.

### Step 1: Technical Survey and Equipment Inventory

Membriko conducts a technical site visit before any proposal. This visit includes:
- Detailed inventory of all existing or proposed equipment: type, manufacturer, maximum height
  of the accessible point, impact zone as defined by EN 1176
- Precise measurement of the area to be surfaced and its geometric configuration
- Assessment of the existing substrate: surface type (concrete, tarmac, soil), structural
  condition, level, and drainage
- Drainage assessment: ground gradient, presence of gulley drains and drainage channels,
  areas of water accumulation
- Full photographic record of the existing condition

The technical report from this visit underpins the Membriko proposal. There is no quotation
without a prior technical site visit.

### Step 2: System Selection and Dimensioning

Based on the survey, Membriko determines:
- Minimum CFH required per equipment zone
- System thickness (PIP or tiles) for each zone
- Colour layout and graphics (if applicable)
- Drainage solution (if the substrate lacks adequate drainage)
- Perimeter restraint profiles and transition details to adjacent paving

The dimensioning is checked against the certified CFH values of the specified system, with
documented safety margin.

### Step 3: Substrate Preparation

Substrate quality is the single most important factor in the long-term performance of the
playground surface. Membriko carries out all necessary preparation works:
- Grading and levelling of the substrate to a minimum 1% fall for drainage
- Repair of cracks or irregularities in existing concrete
- Installation of drainage channels and gully grates where the substrate is impermeable
  (concrete, tarmac), as in covered school playgrounds
- Compaction of earthen or granular substrates
- Final surface planarity check: irregularities greater than 5 mm under a 2 m straight edge
  are corrected before surfacing commences

### Step 4: Installation of Perimeter Restraint Profile

Aluminium or EPDM perimeter restraint profiles are mechanically fixed to the perimeter of the
surface area before the surfacing system is installed. These profiles:
- Contain the surface material and prevent lateral displacement at the edges
- Define the finished surface level
- Create the transition between the EPDM surface and surrounding paving (concrete, stone, gravel)
- Can incorporate ramped access profiles for wheelchair accessibility

### Step 5: Base Layer Application (PIP) or Tile Laying

For PIP systems, the recycled SBR base layer is mixed in a site mixer or continuous mixing
unit and trowel-applied over the prepared substrate. Thickness is controlled with screeds and
depth gauges. The base layer is left to cure for 24-48 hours before the EPDM wearing course
is applied.

For tile systems, tiles are bedded with two-component polyurethane adhesive on the prepared
substrate, with 3-5 mm joints between tiles to accommodate thermal expansion. Perimeter tiles
are cut to size on site with appropriate equipment.

### Step 6: EPDM Wearing Course Application (PIP) or Tile Fixing

For PIP systems, the pigmented EPDM granule is blended with aliphatic polyurethane binder and
trowel-applied over the cured base layer to a depth of 12-15 mm. Colour zone boundaries are
executed with a rubber straight edge or guide profiles to achieve clean, sharp lines. Graphics
are executed in sequence, observing each colour's binder cure time before adjacent colours are
applied.

For tile systems, perimeter fixing is reinforced with mechanical anchors into the restraint
profile. Joints between tiles are inspected for uniform width.

### Step 7: Finishing, Graphics, and Transitions

All finishing elements are completed at this stage:
- Transitions to adjacent paving (chamfers, ramp profiles, tactile warning strips)
- Inlaid graphic elements in contrasting EPDM colour (game markings, decorative elements)
- Drainage function test: channels and gully grates are tested with water before the playground
  is opened
- Surface cleaning and site clearance

### Step 8: Final Inspection and EN 1177 Certification Handover

Membriko's final inspection includes:
- Visual inspection of the entire surface: uniformity, absence of blistering or delamination,
  integrity of perimeter profiles
- Thickness measurement by core sampling at multiple points to confirm compliance with
  the design specification
- Verification of accessibility transitions (ramp profiles, level changes)
- Complete photographic as-built record
- Handover of the certification file: DoP, CE marking, EN 1177 test reports, photographic
  record, maintenance and inspection guide for the playground operator

## Colour and Design Options

One of the defining advantages of EPDM as a playground surface material is its chromatic
versatility. EPDM granules are produced in an extensive colour palette — pigments are incorporated
during the granule manufacturing process, not applied as a surface coating, which means colour
stability is maintained throughout the full depth of the material and is not diminished by
surface wear.

### Available Colour Palette

Membriko offers EPDM granules in the following colour categories:
- **Primary safety colours:** red, yellow, blue, green
- **Naturalistic tones:** terracotta, brown, grey, dark green, beige — for playgrounds in
  natural settings that require landscape integration
- **High visibility:** orange, lime yellow, purple — for zone demarcation or playgrounds
  requiring strong visual presence in urban environments
- **Black:** standard, with carbon black as the primary UV absorber

### Multi-Zone Colour Design

For playgrounds with multiple zones (swing area, climbing area, sand play zone, picnic area),
Membriko can create colour layouts that:
- Visually delineate each equipment zone with a distinct wearing course colour
- Highlight the impact zone of each piece of equipment with a contrasting colour ring (for
  example, a red ring around a climbing structure on a green ground)
- Create smooth colour transitions or sharp zone boundaries, depending on the design intent

### Permanent Inlaid Graphics

The PIP system allows permanent, surface-flush graphics to be integrated into the wearing
course: game markings (hopscotch, number tracks, compass rose, giant chess board), animal
shapes, letters and numerals at child scale, geometric patterns, stylised maps.

Execution uses contrasting EPDM colour blended into the wearing course — the graphics are
flush with the surface (no raised edges), presenting no trip hazard, and are as durable as
the wearing course itself. Membriko collaborates with landscape architects, playground designers
and local councils to develop custom graphic layouts for each project.

## EPDM vs Alternatives — Rubber Mulch, Sand, and Artificial Grass

Membriko presents this comparison with honest technical rigour. Each material has specific
contexts of appropriate use — the objective is to help clients make decisions with accurate
information.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Rubber Mulch | Sand / Gravel | Artificial Grass + Shock Pad |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EN 1177 certification | Yes — consistent and permanent | Variable — depth-dependent | Variable | Yes — pad-dependent |
| Wheelchair accessibility | Yes | No | No | Partial |
| Surface displacement | None | Yes — frequent replenishment required | Yes | None |
| Hygiene and contamination | Easy to clean, no biological risk | Difficult — traps debris | Animal contamination risk | Microplastic generation from fibre degradation |
| UV / colour stability | 15-20 years | Limited (SBR without EPDM top layer) | N/A | 8-12 years (fibre degradation) |
| Inlaid graphics | Yes — permanent | No | No | Paint only (not permanent) |
| Surface temperature (direct sun) | < 55°C (light colours) | < 55°C | High (sand retains heat) | 60-80°C — documented burn risk |
| Maintenance burden | Low — inspection and washing | High — replenishment, raking, hygiene | High — replenishment, hygiene | Medium |
| Service life | 15-20 years | 5-10 years | Continuous replenishment | 8-12 years |
| 20-year lifecycle cost index | 100 | 130 (replenishment + maintenance) | 150 (continuous maintenance) | 120 (replacement at year 10) |

**Note on artificial grass surface temperature:** the surface temperature of synthetic turf
under direct sun can reach 60 to 80°C in Portuguese summer conditions — a documented burn risk
for young children with exposed skin in contact with the surface. EPDM surfaces, even in darker
colours, remain significantly cooler. For playgrounds with full sun exposure and no tree or
structure shade, Membriko recommends lighter EPDM colours (grey, beige, soft green) that
minimise solar absorption.

**Note on rubber mulch and SBR crumb rubber:** granules of SBR crumb rubber from recycled
tyres without an EPDM wearing course may contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at
concentrations subject to increasing EU regulatory restrictions. The virgin EPDM used by
Membriko does not present this issue — EPDM composition is controlled and documented, with no
PAH content.

---

## Drainage Under Playground Surfaces

Correct drainage beneath the EPDM playground surface is a technical and safety requirement,
not a secondary consideration. EN 1177 defines impact attenuation tests under dry surface
conditions. A water-saturated base layer changes the attenuation properties and may effectively
reduce the Critical Fall Height below the certified value. Water accumulation on the surface
also creates slip hazards and biological contamination risk.

### Drainage Design Principles

**Substrate with adequate gradient:** the playground area must have a minimum 1% fall towards
perimeter drainage channels or a sub-surface drainage system. Membriko always verifies the
substrate gradient during the technical survey and rectifies inadequate falls before installation.

**Draining base layer structure:** the recycled SBR base layer, when correctly formulated and
applied, has an open-cell structure that allows vertical water percolation. This drainage path
must have an effective outlet — a permeable sub-base (gravel, porous macadam) or a perforated
pipe drainage system.

**Drainage in tile systems:** most EPDM tile systems incorporate 3-5 mm joints between tiles
and profiled tile undersides that allow lateral water movement to the sub-base below.

**Impermeable substrates (concrete, tarmac):** in covered school playgrounds, urban plazas,
or other situations where the substrate is impermeable, Membriko designs a perimeter channel
drainage system and intermediate gully grates integrated into the surface layout. This solution
is discussed and dimensioned before installation — it is never a problem discovered during
construction.

## Maintenance of EPDM Playground Surfaces

One of the most significant practical advantages of EPDM playground surfacing is the low
maintenance burden compared with loose-fill alternatives. Membriko provides a maintenance
guide to every client at project handover, but the fundamental requirements are straightforward.

### Routine Maintenance

**Regular cleaning:** EPDM surfaces can be washed with pressure water (up to 150 bar) to
remove leaves, dust, organic debris, and graffiti. No specialist cleaning products are required
for routine maintenance — water alone is effective. For graffiti removal, Membriko specifies
compatible cleaning agents that do not affect the wearing course.

**Debris removal:** periodic sweeping or leaf blowing to remove leaf litter and debris that
may accumulate in tile joints or at the perimeter restraint profile.

**Visual inspection:** at the start and end of each period of intensive use (before summer and
at the return from school holidays), Membriko recommends a visual inspection of the surface:
integrity of the wearing course, condition of perimeter profiles, condition of graphics and
colour zone boundaries, absence of delamination or blistering.

### Annual Formal Inspection

Decreto-Lei 379/97 requires playground operators to maintain inspection and maintenance records
accessible to regulatory authorities. Membriko offers an annual inspection service that includes:
- System thickness measurement at multiple points to verify that the certified CFH is maintained
- Inspection of perimeter profile fixings
- Assessment of wearing course condition: wear, cracking, delamination
- Written technical report with maintenance or repair recommendations
- Update of the inspection register for regulatory compliance

### Repair

**Localised PIP repair:** if the wearing course sustains localised mechanical damage (object
impact, vandalism), the affected area is routed out, cleaned, and refilled with fresh EPDM
granule of the matching colour and binder. When executed correctly by Membriko, the repair
is visually indistinguishable. Matching EPDM granules from the original installation batch
are stored for future repairs.

**Tile replacement:** a damaged tile in a tile system is removed using a heat spatula or
mechanically (depending on the adhesive used) and replaced with a new tile of the same
thickness and colour. Replacing a standard 500 × 500 mm tile is a 2-3 hour operation that
does not require closure of the playground beyond the immediate work zone.

## Portuguese Playground Safety Regulations

### Decreto-Lei n.º 379/97 — Principal Legal Instrument

Decreto-Lei n.º 379/97 of 27 December establishes the safety regime for children's play areas
and playground equipment in publicly accessible spaces in Portugal. Its fundamental requirements
for playground surfacing include:

- Play areas must have impact-attenuating surfaces that comply with the requirements of European
  standards EN 1176 and EN 1177 within the fall zones of each piece of equipment
- The playground operator (local council, school, condominium) is legally responsible for
  continuously maintaining the safety conditions of the installation, including the preservation
  of surface thickness and integrity
- Inspection and maintenance records must be maintained and accessible to regulatory authorities

**Membriko provides the full technical documentation that satisfies all licensing and inspection
requirements under Decreto-Lei 379/97.** The Declaration of Performance, CE marking, and EN 1177
laboratory test reports are an integral part of the project handover file for every Membriko
installation.

### EN 1176 and EN 1177 — Technical Standards

**EN 1176-1:2017 (Playground equipment — General safety requirements):** defines the Free Height
of Fall (FHF) of each equipment type and the impact zones (the area around each piece of equipment
within which the certified impact-attenuating surface must be present). Impact zones are
significantly larger than the equipment footprint — Membriko always calculates the correct
impact zones for each piece of equipment as part of the design process.

**EN 1177:2018 (Impact attenuating playground surfacing — Determination of critical fall height):**
defines the test methodology, the HIC < 1,000 threshold, and the CFH determination process.
All Membriko surfacing systems are certified by accredited laboratories to this standard.

### Portaria n.º 216-B/2008

Establishes the procedural requirements for playground installation, inspection, and maintenance
in public spaces, including the requirement for documented records of all inspections. Membriko
provides the initial certification and can support subsequent annual inspections.

### Municipal Licensing

Installation or renewal of a playground in a public space requires approval from the relevant
Câmara Municipal. Tender specifications and licensing requirements in the Leiria, Coimbra,
Santarém, and Castelo Branco districts — Membriko's primary service area from Pombal — routinely
require EN 1177-certified surfaces with CE marking and full technical documentation. Membriko
provides all documentation required for the licensing process.

---

## Accessibility Compliance — Inclusive Playground Design

Inclusive playground design is today a legal obligation, not an optional extra. Decreto-Lei
163/2006 (accessibility in public spaces) and the European guidelines flowing from the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) — ratified by Portugal —
require that playgrounds in public spaces be accessible to children and adults with limited
mobility, including wheelchair users.

Membriko's EPDM playground surfaces are the only surface material that simultaneously achieves:
- **EN 1177 certification** (certified impact-attenuating surface)
- **Firm and stable surface** accessible for wheelchair users (ASTM F1951 / ISO 10882)
- **Controlled cross-slope** (< 2% perpendicular to the direction of travel)
- **Flush transitions** between surface zones and adjacent paving (EPDM or aluminium ramp
  profiles integrated into the installation)
- **Continuous accessible route** from the playground entrance to accessible equipment

Loose-fill surfaces (sand, bark mulch, rubber mulch) are inherently incompatible with wheelchair
accessibility — they create excessive rolling resistance and cannot maintain a firm pathway.
Synthetic grass has partial accessibility but presents the temperature and microplastic issues
already described.

Membriko reviews the specifications of each piece of equipment to ensure that the accessible
route reaches every access point of inclusive equipment (wheelchair swing, accessible roundabout,
inclusive climbing structure) with the correct surfacing and appropriate transitions.

## UV and Weather Durability in Portugal

Portugal has solar irradiance conditions among the most demanding in continental Europe. A
playground surface in Évora or Faro receives more UV energy over a year than an equivalent
surface in Amsterdam or Berlin. European polymer durability test standards were developed for
a central European climate — Portuguese conditions are significantly more demanding for surface
polymer systems.

### UV Performance of EPDM Under Portuguese Conditions

EPDM has two UV resistance mechanisms acting in combination:

**Saturated polymer backbone:** the absence of C=C double bonds in the EPDM main chain
eliminates the preferred sites of UV attack. Polymer photodegradation occurs primarily through
chain scission at double bond positions — EPDM has no such vulnerabilities in its main chain.

**UV-stable pigments:** EPDM granules are pigmented with inorganic pigments (metallic oxides)
that are inherently stable to UV radiation — they do not undergo photobleaching or photochemical
colour-change reactions. Carbon black, the base pigment in black EPDM, is the most effective
known UV absorber for polymer systems.

The practical result, verified in playground surfaces installed across Portugal over the past
15 years: the EPDM wearing course maintains structural integrity and impact attenuation
performance throughout its projected 15-20 year service life. Reduction in chromatic brightness
is perceptible over the years but does not compromise the safety function or dimensional
stability of the surface.

### Resistance to Thermal Cycling and Freeze-Thaw

EPDM remains flexible between -40°C and +130°C — a range that encompasses all Portuguese
climatic conditions, including winters in the Serra da Estrela and summers in the Alentejo.
There is no risk of thermal shrinkage cracking within the temperature range relevant to Portugal.
At higher altitudes — village playgrounds in the Serra da Estrela, mountain area parks in the
Gerês — where freeze-thaw cycles can occur, the flexibility of EPDM at sub-zero temperatures
prevents the type of delamination that affects more rigid materials.

## Frequently Asked Questions — EPDM Playground Surfaces

**What thickness of EPDM playground surface do I need for my play equipment?**

The correct thickness is determined by the Critical Fall Height requirement, which equals the
height of the highest accessible point of each piece of play equipment. For example, a climbing
frame with a platform at 2.0 m requires a certified system with CFH ≥ 2.0 m — which typically
corresponds to 80 mm tiles or PIP system. Membriko always calculates the required thickness
from the specific equipment inventory of each project, not from generic default values.

**Does EPDM playground surfacing comply with Decreto-Lei 379/97?**

Yes. EPDM playground surfacing certified to EN 1177:2018 fully satisfies the impact-attenuating
surface requirements of Decreto-Lei 379/97. Membriko provides the Declaration of Performance,
CE marking, and accredited laboratory test reports required for municipal licensing and compliance
documentation.

**What is the difference between a poured-in-place system and EPDM tiles?**

The poured-in-place (PIP) system is produced on site in two layers — recycled SBR as the base
and pigmented EPDM as the wearing course. It creates a seamless, jointless surface ideal for
large areas and integrated graphics. EPDM tiles are factory-manufactured with certified thickness
and CFH, installed with adhesive. They are individually replaceable and quicker to install.
Membriko recommends the most appropriate system after the technical site visit.

**Is EPDM playground surfacing accessible for wheelchair users?**

Yes. EPDM is the only playground surface material that combines EN 1177 safety certification
with a firm and stable surface accessible for wheelchair users. Membriko includes the necessary
ramped access transition profiles in every installation to provide a continuous accessible
route from the playground entrance to inclusive equipment, in compliance with Decreto-Lei
163/2006.

**How long does an EPDM playground surface last in outdoor conditions in Portugal?**

The EPDM wearing course has a typical service life of 15-20 years under Portuguese outdoor
conditions. The SBR base layer has an effectively unlimited service life (it is not exposed to
UV or direct mechanical wear). Tile systems can achieve 20 years or more with point replacement
of tiles in high-traffic zones. This longevity is far superior to synthetic grass (8-12 years)
and incomparably better than loose-fill surfaces requiring continuous replenishment.

**Can inlaid game markings and graphics be created in EPDM playground surfaces?**

Yes, and permanently. Poured-in-place systems allow the integration of graphics in contrasting
EPDM colours — hopscotch, number tracks, compass roses, letters, animal shapes, bespoke patterns
— cast into the wearing course flush with the surface. There is no trip hazard (the graphic is
level with the surface), no peeling (EPDM granule is not a paint), and the durability matches
that of the wearing course itself. Membriko works with designers and landscape architects to
develop bespoke graphic layouts for each project.

**Does EPDM get very hot in summer? Is it safe for bare-footed young children?**

EPDM surfaces reach significantly lower temperatures than synthetic grass under direct sunlight.
Synthetic grass can reach 60-80°C — a temperature that causes burns on the exposed skin of
young children. EPDM in dark colours under full direct sun can reach 50-55°C; in light colours
(light grey, beige, soft green), it typically remains below 45°C. Membriko always recommends
lighter EPDM colours for playgrounds with intensive sun exposure and no shade from trees or

**What warranty does Membriko provide for playground surface installations?**

Membriko issues a 10-year installation warranty on poured-in-place EPDM systems and a 5-year
warranty on EPDM tile installations, covering defects in materials and workmanship. This is
supplementary to the manufacturer's product warranty and to the 5-year statutory defects
liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code (Art. 1225). The EN 1177 certification file
and the installation inspection report are delivered to the client at project completion.
