# EPDM Sports Surfaces: Running Tracks, Multi-Use Games Areas and Gymnasium Flooring

## Section 1: Portuguese Sports Infrastructure and the Surface Problem

Portugal has built an extensive network of sports facilities over the past three decades. Secondary school athletics tracks, municipal multi-sport courts, gymnasium halls in every district capital, tennis clubs and hotel courts scattered across the Algarve and the Douro Valley — the fabric of Portuguese sporting infrastructure is dense and well-distributed. These facilities are used daily by schoolchildren during Physical Education lessons, by club athletes in evening training sessions, by elderly residents enrolled in municipal fitness programmes, and by competitive athletes preparing for regional and national championships.

The problem is one of age. A substantial proportion of Portugal's sports surfaces were installed during the 1990s and early 2000s, when funding from central government and the EU Structural Funds enabled a wave of construction across the country. Many of those surfaces — painted asphalt tracks, low-cost synthetic polyurethane systems, basic acrylic coatings on concrete courts — have now reached or exceeded the end of their design service life. Asphalt running tracks crack along expansion joints and develop differential settlement that creates uneven running lanes. Painted surfaces fade visibly within two or three years under the UV intensity of southern Portugal, leaving courts without legible line markings. Aromatic polyurethane systems yellow and lose mechanical performance, falling out of specification for World Athletics certification. Multi-sport courts with degraded surfaces create genuine safety risks: falls, ankle injuries, and abrasion hazards that expose facility managers and municipalities to liability.

The financial and operational pressure is real. Municipalities face renovation decisions on facilities that were built to last twenty years and are now thirty years old. Athletics clubs that wish to host sanctioned regional competitions must demonstrate World Athletics-compatible surface performance — and older tracks frequently fail the required mechanical tests. School administrators managing DGEstE-funded infrastructure must maintain surfaces that satisfy the Regime Jurídico das Instalações Desportivas (RJID, Decreto-Lei 10/2009), and degraded surfaces put those facilities out of compliance.

Membriko, based in Pombal in the Leiria district of central Portugal, specialises in EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) rubber sports surfaces because EPDM is the material that solves this problem with the best combination of documented performance, durability, and long-term economics. Membriko installs World Athletics-compatible running track systems, coloured EPDM multi-sport courts, gymnasium and fitness flooring, and tennis court surfaces — the full range of outdoor and indoor sports surfaces used across Portugal's school, municipal, and club facility network.

Membriko's sports surface installations carry a 15-year installation warranty. EPDM systems installed by Membriko are specified to deliver 15–20 years of service life in Portuguese conditions, with maintenance costs that are a fraction of what acrylic or aromatic polyurethane alternatives require over the same period.

## Section 2: Why EPDM Is the Right Material for Sports Surfaces

A sports surface must simultaneously satisfy three engineering demands that pull in opposite directions. It must absorb impact to protect athletes from repetitive stress injuries — but absorb too much and the athlete loses propulsive energy with every stride. It must return energy to give athletes the responsive, fast-track sensation that translates into performance — but the material cannot be so stiff that it fails to attenuate impact. And it must survive fifteen to twenty years of UV radiation, thermal cycling, mechanical wear from spiked footwear, rain, frost, and intensive daily use without significant degradation of those same mechanical properties.

No single synthetic material achieves this combination as naturally as vulcanised EPDM rubber.

### The Elastomer Mechanics of EPDM in Sport

The molecular architecture of EPDM is a saturated carbon-carbon backbone — the ethylene-propylene copolymer chain — with ethylidene norbornene (ENB) diene units in pendant side-chain positions. These ENB units are the vulcanisation sites: sulphur or peroxide crosslinks form three-dimensional networks that give the material its elastic memory. Unlike foam-based systems (EVA, polyethylene) that dissipate impact energy primarily as heat, the EPDM crosslinked network stores deformation energy elastically and returns it during the rebound phase of the loading cycle. This is the fundamental physics behind what athletes experience as a "fast" or "responsive" track surface.

In practice, when a competitive sprinter lands with approximately 2.5 times their body weight in ground reaction force, the EPDM granulate system compresses in approximately 50–150 milliseconds. The porous granulate structure — irregular rubber particles bound in a polyurethane binder matrix with controlled void content — acts as a calibrated spring system. The stiffness of that spring is set by the granulate particle size distribution, the PU binder content, the layer thickness, and the sub-base stiffness. Membriko's technical specifications for each project are calculated to place the resulting system within the World Athletics target window: force reduction of 35–50% and energy return of ≥ 50%.

Below 35% force reduction, the surface transmits excessive impact to the musculoskeletal system, creating cumulative loading that causes tibial stress reactions, plantar fasciitis, patellar tendinopathy, and other overuse injuries. Above 50% force reduction, the surface is too compliant — athletes lose propulsive energy and describe the track as "sluggish" or "heavy." Membriko designs every running track system to land within specification, not simply to pass the minimum test threshold.

### UV and Colour Stability — EPDM's Critical Advantage in Portugal

Portugal receives some of the highest UV radiation of any country in mainland Europe. UV-B irradiance in the Alentejo and Algarve regions is approximately three times the level measured in northern Britain. For any outdoor sports surface pigment system, this UV intensity is a brutal long-term test.

Aromatic polyurethane systems — which account for a large proportion of the synthetic sports surfaces installed across Portugal over the past two decades — contain UV-sensitive chemical bonds in the isocyanate-polyol polymer backbone. Aromatic PU yellows visibly under UV exposure. Organic pigment systems used in low-cost EPDM alternatives fade from vivid red or blue to a washed-out pink or grey within three to five years at typical southern Portuguese UV levels. Courts lose their line marking contrast; tracks lose their visual identity; facility managers face resurfacing decisions long before the mechanical life of the surface is exhausted.

Membriko specifies only inorganic pigment systems for all outdoor EPDM sports surface applications. Inorganic pigments — iron oxide for reds, oranges, and terracottas; chromium oxide for green; modified titanium dioxide for white and grey; carbon black for anthracite and black — are chemically stable under UV radiation because they do not have UV-labile organic bonds. Accelerated weathering tests to EN ISO 4892-3 (2,000+ hours, xenon arc) show no measurable colour change. That 2,000-hour test represents the equivalent of approximately 15 years of outdoor UV exposure in central Portugal. Membriko's red athletics track surfaces look as saturated and defined at year twelve as they did at installation.

### Surface Temperature Behaviour

In direct Portuguese summer sun, dark sports surfaces can reach 65–70°C surface temperature. EPDM's service temperature range extends to +130°C; at 65–70°C, the mechanical properties of a properly formulated EPDM system remain within specification. Aromatic polyurethane systems soften measurably above 60°C, creating temporary changes in surface compliance and increasing the risk of damage from the spike penetration of spiked athletic footwear during peak summer conditions.

## Section 3: Surface Types — Running Tracks, Multi-Sport Courts, Gymnasium Flooring, Tennis Courts

### Running Tracks

The 400-metre competition athletics track is the most technically demanding surface in the Membriko portfolio. Eight to ten running lanes of 1.22 metres width; banked curves with superelevation; spiked athletic footwear penetrating the surface on every contact; decades of UV, rain, frost, and thermal cycling from winter overnight temperatures in the Beira Interior to summer afternoon surface temperatures of 65°C-plus. No surface system that lacks the core properties of EPDM rubber — elastic resilience, UV stability, thermal range, and dimensional integrity — survives this environment with its mechanical performance intact.

Membriko installs EPDM athletics track systems for two World Athletics performance classes:

**World Athletics Class 3 systems** are the standard specification for municipal athletics tracks, school tracks, and club facilities that host regional and inter-club competitions sanctioned by the Federação Portuguesa de Atletismo (FPA). The Membriko Class 3 system uses a base course of SBR/EPDM granulate bound with MDI polyurethane binder (12–15 mm total system thickness) with an EPDM coloured wearing course of 3–5 mm. The system is designed to achieve force reduction of 35–50% and energy return of ≥ 50% measured by an accredited laboratory to EN 14809 and EN 14808.

**World Athletics Class 2 systems** are required for national championship events. Membriko installs hybrid systems combining an EPDM/SBR base course (9–12 mm) with a full-pour polyurethane wearing layer (3–4 mm) incorporating EPDM texture aggregate. The sealed PU surface provides the higher spike penetration resistance and tighter mechanical tolerances required for Class 2 certification. Membriko coordinates the complete World Athletics certification process for Class 2 projects, including accredited laboratory testing and documentation submission to World Athletics with FPA.

**School athletics tracks** — whether full 400-metre ovals or straight 60–200-metre running strips — are designed and installed by Membriko to the usage profile of school PE programmes and after-school club training. Membriko's school track systems emphasise durability and drainage over peak competition performance, with specifications appropriate for DGEstE-managed facilities.

### Multi-Use Games Areas (MUGAs)

The multi-sport court — marked for basketball, futsal, volleyball, handball, and other court sports — is the most common sports facility in Portugal. Every parish council of any size has one, and they are used daily by the local community from early morning to late evening. The problem is that a large proportion of these courts are surfaced in painted concrete or asphalt, and the paint markings become illegible within two summers under Portuguese UV intensity. The asphalt itself develops cracking and surface loss that creates trip hazards and uneven bounce. Municipalities face repeated repainting cycles on surfaces that never improve structurally.

Membriko replaces these worn surfaces with 8–12 mm poured EPDM systems applied either directly over structurally sound existing concrete or asphalt, or over new prepared sub-bases. Multi-sport line markings for basketball, futsal, volleyball, and handball are incorporated into the EPDM surface itself in contrasting granulate colours — orange for basketball, white for futsal, yellow for volleyball — using a wet-in-wet technique that produces permanent, co-planar markings with the same 15–20-year service life as the surface. No repainting cycle every two years.

The porous EPDM surface Membriko installs on outdoor courts drains precipitation at 2–5 cm/min, returning the court to playable condition within 30–60 minutes of a rain event. The granulate texture maintains a friction coefficient of 0.47–0.65 (EN 13036-4) even on a wet surface — a critical safety characteristic for the rapid direction changes of futsal and basketball that produce high lateral loading on the ankle and knee.

### Gymnasium and Fitness Flooring

Indoor gymnasium and fitness facilities impose a distinctive combination of demands on flooring. Static loads from strength equipment (200–400 kg per machine) impose prolonged compression on any surface beneath them. Free weight and barbell drops from height generate short-duration impact forces of 5–15 kN. Lateral cutting movements during functional training, aerobics classes, and group exercise generate friction and torsional forces at the shoe-surface interface. And through it all, foot traffic of 200–500 people per day creates cumulative surface abrasion.

EPDM is the globally established standard material for gymnasium and fitness flooring, from Olympic training centres to local gym facilities, because it is uniquely able to satisfy this combination of demands without compromise.

Membriko installs gymnasium EPDM flooring in modular tiles (500×500 mm or 1,000×1,000 mm) or in roll format, bonded to the substrate or interlocking for demountable installations:

- **12 mm high-density EPDM** for free weight zones and Olympic barbell drop areas (specific gravity ≥ 1.4 to resist permanent compression set under static equipment loads)
- **8 mm EPDM** for cardio equipment areas, functional training zones, and multipurpose exercise areas
- **6 mm EPDM** for stretching areas, yoga, Pilates, and low-impact activity zones

High-density EPDM formulation at 12 mm thickness absorbs barbell drop impacts without delamination from the substrate and without transmitting damaging impulse forces to the concrete slab below — a relevant concern in multi-storey fitness facilities where structural impact transmission must be controlled.

### Tennis Courts

Outdoor tennis courts require a surface that delivers a specific combination of ball response, player slide control, UV durability, and wet-weather consistency. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) classifies court surfaces by pace rating — the speed of play they produce — and specifies test methods for vertical ball rebound, horizontal ball rebound, and surface traction.

Membriko specifies 8–10 mm textured EPDM systems for outdoor tennis courts, formulated for ITF Surface Category 2 (medium pace) — the most versatile specification for club and hotel tennis facilities in Portugal. The wearing course granulate size (0.5–1.0 mm fine-grade EPDM) is selected to produce the consistent horizontal ball rebound and controlled player sliding that ITF Category 2 requires. UV-stable inorganic pigments in the standard Membriko tennis court palette — green, blue, and terracotta — maintain colour integrity for the full service life without resurfacing.

For hotel and resort tennis facilities, Membriko can incorporate club logos and branding into the court surface using contrasting EPDM granulate colours, creating a permanent identity element that requires no maintenance over the life of the surface.

## Section 4: Performance Characteristics — Shock Absorption, Energy Return, and Slip Resistance

### Shock Absorption: Protecting Athletes' Joints

Repetitive stress injuries — tibial stress fractures, plantar fasciitis, patellar tendinopathy, shin splints — are the most common non-contact injuries in distance running and court sports. These injuries result from the cumulative loading of impact forces that a surface transmits fully to the athlete's musculoskeletal system, without the attenuation that a compliant, energy-absorbing surface provides.

World Athletics defines the target force reduction range for competition running tracks as 35–50%, measured relative to a rigid concrete reference. This range represents the window of surface compliance that provides meaningful joint protection without degrading propulsive efficiency. Below 35%, the surface is essentially as hard as concrete — athletes bear the full impact of every footstrike. Above 50%, the surface is too compliant — energy that should propel the athlete forward is absorbed by the surface.

Membriko sizes EPDM sports surface systems to achieve force reduction within this window under the specific conditions of each installation: sub-base stiffness, climate zone, and expected use intensity. For school and club tracks where the user population spans competitive athletes to elderly walkers in municipal health programmes, Membriko tends to specify toward the upper end of the force reduction range (40–50%) to maximise joint protection for the most vulnerable users.

### Energy Return: The "Fast Track" Characteristic

Energy return — the fraction of impact energy returned elastically to the athlete, rather than dissipated as heat — is the physical mechanism behind what athletes describe as a "fast" or "lively" track surface. World Athletics requires energy return of ≥ 50% for competition-grade running tracks. Low-quality EVA foam systems or poorly specified SBR granulate surfaces fail this criterion: athletes describe them as heavy and exhausting, and their times suffer accordingly.

The vulcanised EPDM rubber network is inherently a high-energy-return elastomer. The three-dimensional crosslink structure stores deformation energy efficiently and releases it during the rebound phase of the loading cycle. The porous granulate-binder composite structure allows the controlled deformation required for force reduction while maintaining the elastic recovery characteristic that produces high energy return. Membriko's track systems achieve energy return of ≥ 50% consistently because the specifications are derived from the mechanical properties of the specific granulate and binder system used, not from generic data.

### Wet Slip Resistance

Portugal's precipitation season runs from October through April, coinciding with active outdoor athletics and court sport seasons. A surface that becomes slippery in rain is not simply a performance problem — it is a safety liability with potential for serious injury from falls during lateral direction changes, takeoff in long and triple jump, or deceleration in sprint events.

The porous EPDM systems Membriko installs on outdoor running tracks and multi-sport courts drain precipitation through the surface at 2–5 cm/min. A rainfall intensity of 20 mm/hour — a typical autumn downpour in central Portugal — is fully absorbed by the surface porosity without standing water accumulation. After the rain, the surface returns to dry or near-dry condition within 30–60 minutes.

Even with the surface still damp, the EPDM granulate texture maintains a friction coefficient of 0.47–0.65 (EN 13036-4) — substantially above the threshold at which slip risk becomes significant. Painted concrete in the same wet conditions can drop to friction coefficients of 0.2–0.3, making rapid direction changes genuinely dangerous. This is the quantified safety difference between a well-specified EPDM surface and the painted concrete courts that Membriko frequently replaces across Portugal.

### Temperature Consistency

A characteristic of EPDM that matters acutely in the Portuguese summer is its mechanical consistency at elevated surface temperatures. The mid-afternoon surface temperature of a dark athletics track in the Alentejo in July can reach 65–68°C. At these temperatures, aromatic polyurethane wearing course systems soften measurably, creating temporary changes in surface compliance that affect performance and increase the risk of spike penetration damage. EPDM's mechanical properties remain within specification tolerance at these temperatures — the service temperature ceiling of well-formulated EPDM is +130°C. Membriko's track and court surfaces perform to specification from the coldest winter training session to the hottest summer competition day.

## Section 5: Installation Process

Membriko follows a structured six-stage installation process for all sports surface projects. The process is designed to ensure mechanical compliance with the applicable standard, surface longevity, and complete documentation for certification, funding, and warranty purposes.

### Stage 1: Technical Survey and Site Assessment

Every Membriko sports surface project begins with a technical site visit, carried out before any quotation or proposal is issued. Membriko's surveyor assesses the existing surface condition (structural integrity, cracking patterns, drainage function, planarity), characterises the sub-base, identifies any drainage infrastructure problems (blocked drainage channels, localised subsidence), carries out a geometric survey of the facility dimensions and gradients, and documents the intended use of the facility — which sports will be played, at what level of competition, and with what weekly usage intensity.

This survey is the foundation for a specification that is genuinely fit for purpose on that specific installation, not a generic specification applied without regard for site conditions.

### Stage 2: Design and Specification

Based on the site survey, Membriko prepares a complete sports surface design: system type selection (porous EPDM, hybrid EPDM/PU, or prefabricated EPDM system), layer thicknesses calculated to achieve the required mechanical parameters for the applicable standard (World Athletics class, EN 14877, EN 14904), colour design and line marking layout, drainage design, and a full materials specification with product data sheets.

For projects seeking IPDJ/PACED public funding, Membriko prepares the technical specification documentation in the format required by the funding programme. This service is provided at no additional charge — Membriko views it as part of the project delivery, not a separate consultancy service.

### Stage 3: Base Preparation

The quality of the base preparation is the primary determinant of surface longevity and planarity. Membriko prepares existing asphalt or concrete bases by crack repair with flexible elastomeric compound, grinding of high points, pressure washing to remove contamination, and application of a primer specific to EPDM adhesion over concrete and asphalt substrates. Planarity is verified with a 3-metre straight-edge; the maximum permitted deviation for competition tracks is ±3 mm. Where the sub-base shows drainage problems, Membriko installs a drainage layer and perforated drainage pipework before EPDM application.

### Stage 4: Base Course Application

The SBR/EPDM granulate base course, bound with MDI polyurethane binder, is applied mechanically using a controlled-thickness screed, ensuring uniform compaction and thickness across the full surface area. Binder content (14–20% by weight of granulate) is specified according to the target mechanical performance parameters for the project. After application, the base course requires 24–48 hours of curing at ambient temperature before wearing course application. The curing surface is protected from rain and foot traffic during this period.

### Stage 5: Wearing Course and Line Marking

The coloured EPDM granulate wearing course is applied over the cured base course to a uniform thickness of 3–5 mm, using a mechanical screed calibrated to the design thickness. Sport line markings in contrasting EPDM colours are applied wet-in-wet with the wearing course — a technique that produces permanent, co-planar, UV-stable markings with the same service life as the surface. Where line marking is specified as painted (typically on multi-sport courts where marking configurations may change over time), Membriko uses UV-stable, two-component polyurethane paint over the cured EPDM surface. Perimeter edge profiles, drainage channels, and channel connections to site drainage are completed in this stage.

### Stage 6: Performance Testing, Certification, and Handover

After full cure of the wearing course (minimum 48 hours), Membriko carries out or coordinates performance testing to the applicable standard. For World Athletics Class 2 and Class 3 track certifications, mechanical tests (force reduction, vertical deformation, energy return, friction) are carried out by an accredited laboratory. Results are compiled in the project technical file. Membriko issues a 15-year installation warranty certificate and delivers the maintenance manual and drainage inspection schedule to the client.

## Section 6: World Athletics Certification for Running Tracks

World Athletics (formerly the International Association of Athletics Federations, IAAF) administers the global certification programme for athletics track surfaces. In Portugal, the Federação Portuguesa de Atletismo (FPA) requires World Athletics surface certification for any competition track used for sanctioned club, regional, or national events. A track whose surface does not meet the applicable World Athletics class requirements cannot host FPA-sanctioned competition — a direct operational constraint for athletics clubs and municipalities whose facilities are used for competition.

### World Athletics Classification System

**Class 1** is required for World Championships, the Olympic Games, Diamond League events, and Area Championships. It demands the most stringent mechanical performance criteria with very tight tolerances, and requires that both the surface system and the manufacturer hold Class 1 product approval. Membriko does not currently install Class 1 systems — this class is served by a small number of specialist international contractors with proprietary certified product systems.

**Class 2** is required for national championship events. Membriko installs hybrid EPDM/PU systems compatible with World Athletics Class 2 requirements and coordinates accredited laboratory testing and certification documentation for submission to World Athletics with FPA.

**Class 3** is the class applicable to the majority of running tracks in Portugal — club facilities, municipal athletics tracks, and school tracks that host inter-club competitions and regional FPA-sanctioned events. Membriko installs Class 3-compatible porous EPDM systems and provides the complete documentation package for World Athletics certification submission through FPA.

### Mechanical Parameters and Their Meaning

| Parameter | World Athletics Target | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Force reduction | 35–50% | EN 14809 |
| Vertical deformation | 0.6–2.0 mm | EN 14808 |
| Energy return | ≥ 50% | EN 14808 |
| Friction coefficient (wet) | 0.47–0.65 | EN 13036-4 |
| Spike penetration resistance | ≥ WA minimum value | World Athletics TFTM |
| Surface regularity | ≤ ±3 mm over 3 m | World Athletics TFTM |

Membriko specifies each track system to achieve these parameters under the specific conditions of the project — ambient temperature during installation and curing, sub-base stiffness, expected use intensity, and climate zone. The specifications are derived from the documented mechanical properties of the specific granulate and binder products used on the project, supplemented by performance data from previous Membriko installations in comparable Portuguese conditions.

### FPA Requirements and the Certification Process

For athletics clubs seeking FPA sanction of their facility, Membriko provides the complete documentation pathway: certified system specification, accredited laboratory test coordination, performance test results compilation, and documentation formatted for submission to the World Athletics facility certification process through FPA. Club administrators do not need to navigate the certification process independently — Membriko manages it as part of the project delivery.

### IPDJ/PACED Funding and Certified Specifications

Public funding programmes administered by IPDJ — principally PACED (Programa de Apoio à Modernização e Capacitação dos Equipamentos Desportivos) — require documented material specifications and certified performance data as conditions of funding approval. Membriko has experience supporting municipalities and athletics clubs through the technical documentation requirements for PACED applications. Contact Membriko at the funding application stage — technical specification preparation is included in the project process and incurs no additional charge.

## Section 7: EPDM vs Polyurethane, Acrylic Coatings, and Artificial Turf

Membriko's position on material selection is straightforward: each application should be specified with the right material for its specific performance and economic requirements. The comparison below reflects the genuine characteristics of each material system in Portuguese conditions, not a sales pitch for EPDM in contexts where another material is more appropriate.

| Characteristic | EPDM (Membriko) | Full-Pour PU | Acrylic Coating | Artificial Turf |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UV colour stability (Portugal) | Excellent — 15+ years with inorganic pigments | Moderate (aromatic) / Good (aliphatic) | Poor — 5–8 years | Good (fibres) |
| Surface temperature resistance | Excellent — to +80°C | Moderate — aromatic PU softens above 60°C | Excellent | Good |
| Shock absorption | Excellent — adjustable by thickness/formulation | Good | None (coating only) | Good (with rubber infill) |
| Energy return | ≥ 50% (vulcanised rubber network) | Good | N/A | Moderate |
| Wet slip resistance | Excellent — porous EPDM drains at 2–5 cm/min | Moderate | Poor when wet | Moderate |
| Installation weather sensitivity | Moderate (PU binder cure is T/RH sensitive) | High — isocyanate cure strongly T/RH sensitive | Low | Low |
| Localised repairability | Good — patch repair with EPDM granulate compound | Poor — section replacement typically required | Good | Moderate |
| Service life | 15–20 years | 10–15 years | 5–8 years | 8–12 years |
| Annual maintenance cost | Low | Medium | High (frequent repainting) | Medium |

**On aliphatic polyurethane:** High-quality aliphatic PU systems are the established standard for World Athletics Class 1 competition tracks and are excellent, UV-stable, high-performance materials. Their principal limitation relative to EPDM is cost — aliphatic PU is substantially more expensive than EPDM systems delivering equivalent performance for Class 2 and Class 3 facilities. For Class 1 international competition tracks, Membriko refers clients to the specialist international contractors who hold Class 1 product approvals. For every other athletics track application in Portugal, EPDM delivers the optimal balance of performance, UV stability, and whole-life cost.

**On artificial turf:** Artificial turf with EPDM rubber infill (in place of SBR recycled tyre crumb) is the correct specification for football, rugby, and field hockey pitches. Membriko does not install artificial turf systems, but Membriko's EPDM granulate can be supplied as infill for artificial turf systems installed by specialist contractors — providing the UV stability and non-carbon-black-bleed characteristics that virgin EPDM granulate offers over recycled SBR.

**On acrylic coatings:** Acrylic systems are thin coatings applied over existing concrete or asphalt. They provide no shock absorption, have poor UV durability in Portugal (5–8 years before significant colour fade), and require frequent repainting of line markings. They have a role in very low-cost, low-priority applications but are not suitable for any facility seeking performance compliance or 15-year service life. Membriko does not install acrylic coating systems.

## Section 8: Drainage Design for Sports Surfaces

Drainage is the most frequently under-specified element of sports surface projects in Portugal, with direct consequences for facility usability, surface longevity, and sub-base integrity. Getting the drainage design right is as important as specifying the correct EPDM system — a correctly specified surface on a poorly drained sub-base will fail prematurely regardless of its material quality.

### Why Drainage Matters in the Portuguese Context

Portugal's precipitation is highly seasonal: October through April delivers the overwhelming majority of the annual rainfall, and individual storm events during this period can deliver 50–80 mm in a few hours. These are also the months of active outdoor athletic seasons — cross-country athletics, autumn and spring track training, school and club competitions. A sports surface that holds standing water for hours after a rain event is not usable during that period. In the worst cases, prolonged water retention beneath the EPDM surface layer saturates the sub-base, promoting differential settlement, loss of planarity, and delamination of the EPDM from its substrate.

### Surface Drainage — Porous EPDM Systems

Membriko's standard outdoor sports surface specification uses open-grade porous EPDM, in which the granulate-binder composite has sufficient void content to allow water to percolate through the surface at ≥ 2 cm/min (EN 12616). This is sufficient to handle all but the most extreme precipitation events without surface water accumulation. Within 30–60 minutes of rain ceasing, the surface is dry enough for safe, unrestricted use.

The surface porosity that enables drainage also serves a secondary function in athletics tracks: it allows spiked footwear to penetrate the surface slightly during the contact phase, creating micro-keying that contributes to the surface friction characteristics tested under EN 13036-4.

### Sub-base Drainage Design

Water that percolates through the EPDM surface must exit through the sub-base drainage layer. Membriko designs each project's drainage system to the specific site conditions: a layer of calibrated clean aggregate (4–8 mm graded stone) beneath the EPDM base course, connected to perforated drainage pipework laid to gradient. The minimum cross-fall gradient for running track straights is 0.5%; for multi-sport courts, 0.8–1.0% is specified to ensure reliable drainage without affecting ball roll consistency. Sub-base drainage pipework connects to the site stormwater drainage network at designed collection points.

### Curved Track Drainage

The 400-metre athletics track geometry creates a specific drainage challenge: the banked curves have superelevation (lateral tilt of the running surface toward the centre of curvature) that directs surface water toward the inside edge of the track. Without specific drainage provisions at this low point, water accumulates in the inner channel of each curve — a common and damaging failure mode on tracks where drainage has not been correctly designed.

Membriko designs curve drainage individually for each project, with drainage channels at the inside edge of each curve connecting to the site drainage network. This removes the accumulated water that damages the inside shoulder of poorly drained tracks and allows the surface to return to full usability uniformly across all lanes.

### Perimeter Drainage

Aluminium or HDPE drainage channels at the perimeter of tracks and courts capture surface water flowing off the sports surface. Membriko specifies and installs perimeter channels as part of the drainage design, sized for the maximum expected runoff rate from the surface area, and connected to site drainage at regular intervals.

## Section 10: Maintenance of EPDM Sports Surfaces

One of Membriko's most consistent points of feedback from municipal clients and athletics club facilities managers is that the maintenance burden of EPDM sports surfaces is substantially lower than they expected, and dramatically lower than the acrylic and aromatic PU surfaces they replaced.

### Routine Maintenance

**Monthly mechanical sweeping** is the primary maintenance task for all outdoor EPDM sports surfaces. Organic debris — leaves, grit transported by footwear, soil from adjacent grassed areas — accumulates in the micro-pores of the EPDM granulate surface. If not removed regularly, this debris progressively reduces surface porosity and drainage rate. Monthly sweeping with a mechanical brush maintains drainage performance within specification. This is a low-cost, low-skill task that can be carried out with standard grounds maintenance equipment.

**Annual pressure washing** removes biological fouling — algae, moss, and biofilm — that can develop on EPDM surfaces in shaded zones, particularly in northern Portugal and the Minho region where rainfall is higher and shading by adjacent trees or buildings is common. Membriko recommends pressure washing at 80–100 bar maximum with clean ambient-temperature water. The EPDM material is unaffected by pressure washing at this level — Membriko's swimming pool installations are routinely cleaned at higher pressures without surface damage.

### Line Marking Maintenance

**EPDM inlay line markings** (contrasting EPDM granulate applied wet-in-wet) require no maintenance over the surface life. They wear at the same rate as the surrounding surface and retain their colour and contrast through the full 15–20-year service life. The higher initial cost of EPDM inlay markings is fully recovered against the repainting costs eliminated over twenty years.

**Painted polyurethane line markings** require reapplication every 3–5 years under Portuguese UV conditions. Membriko's maintenance contracts include periodic line marking inspection and repainting with UV-stable, two-component polyurethane paint. Membriko recommends EPDM inlay markings wherever the court configuration is unlikely to change — the lifetime cost is lower, the appearance is superior, and no maintenance visits are required.

### Damage Repair

Localised surface damage from vandalism (cuts, gouges) or dropped heavy objects can be repaired by Membriko using an EPDM granulate and PU binder repair compound, applied to the cleaned and primed damage zone. Repairs are visible at close inspection but structurally effective and do not compromise the mechanical compliance of the surface. Larger damaged areas require section removal and re-pour; seam and edge damage is repaired with PU adhesive and EPDM patch material.

### Recommended Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanical debris sweeping | Monthly | Maintains surface porosity and drainage |
| Biological fouling — pressure wash | Annual | 80–100 bar maximum; spring or autumn |
| Line marking inspection | Annual | Repaint PU lines if required (every 3–5 years) |
| Drainage channel and pipe cleaning | Annual | Before the October–November rain season |
| Full surface condition inspection | Annual (spring) | Written report with photographic record |
| Perimeter edge profile and seal inspection | Every two years | Reseal or replace as required |
| Sub-base drainage performance check | Every two years | Percolation test on representative sections |

Membriko offers optional annual maintenance contracts covering inspection, biological washing, drain clearing, minor repair, and line marking condition assessment. Contact Membriko in Pombal to discuss contract terms for your facility.

## Section 11: Portuguese Sports Facility Regulations

### RJID — Regime Jurídico das Instalações Desportivas

The legal framework for sports facility design, construction, modification, and operation in Portugal is established by Decreto-Lei n.º 10/2009 and its subsequent amendments (the RJID — Regime Jurídico das Instalações Desportivas). The RJID sets minimum performance requirements for the surfaces of publicly funded sports facilities and mandates compliance with applicable European standards: EN 14877 for outdoor synthetic surfaces and EN 14904 for indoor sports hall floors.

Membriko EPDM sports surface systems specified and installed in accordance with EN 14877 and EN 14904 satisfy RJID requirements in full. Membriko provides the performance test certificates, product declarations, and installation documentation required for RJID compliance and building licence applications.

### IPDJ and the PACED Funding Programme

The Instituto Português do Desporto e da Juventude (IPDJ) manages public co-funding programmes for the modernisation of sports facility infrastructure, principally through the PACED (Programa de Apoio à Modernização e Capacitação dos Equipamentos Desportivos) programme and equivalent initiatives. Municipal sports infrastructure projects — including athletics track renovation and multi-sport court construction — are eligible for PACED co-funding subject to documentary requirements including:

- Detailed technical specification of the surfaces to be installed, with reference to applicable European standards and performance classes
- Contractor qualification evidence
- Commitment to post-installation performance verification testing

Membriko supports municipalities and athletics clubs in the preparation of PACED technical documentation, including the specification documents and performance data required for funding applications. This support is available from the earliest stages of planning and is provided as part of Membriko's project process.

### FPA — Federação Portuguesa de Atletismo

The FPA requires World Athletics-compatible track surface performance for the sanctioning of any athletics competition at club, regional, or national level in Portugal. Athletics clubs that host inter-club, regional, or national FPA-sanctioned events must be able to demonstrate that their track surface meets the applicable World Athletics class requirements.

Membriko supplies the systems and documentation for World Athletics Class 2 and Class 3 certification, coordinates accredited laboratory testing, and prepares the documentation package for submission to the World Athletics facility certification process in liaison with FPA. Athletics club managers who are navigating the certification process for the first time are encouraged to contact Membriko early — the certification timeline can be planned in advance and the process is more straightforward than it appears from the outside.

### School Sports Facilities — DGEstE Requirements

The Direção-Geral dos Estabelecimentos Escolares (DGEstE) manages the school building infrastructure programme and oversees the specification standards for school sports facilities. School athletics tracks and multi-sport courts must meet RJID requirements. Membriko works directly with school management, municipal clients who fund school facility works, and DGEstE project managers to deliver specifications that satisfy both the regulatory requirements and the practical needs of PE programmes.

### Safety Standards at Mixed Sport and Play Facilities

Where sports surfaces are installed adjacent to or integrated with children's playground equipment — common on school and parish council sites — the transition zones between the sports surface and the play area must comply with EN 1176 (playground equipment safety) and EN 1177 (impact attenuating surfacing for play areas). Membriko coordinates the specification of sports and play surfaces on mixed sites, ensuring compliance with both sets of standards across each respective zone.

### Indoor Sports Surfaces — Fire Reaction Classification

For indoor gymnasium and sports hall EPDM flooring, EN 13501-1 fire reaction classification is required. Membriko's indoor EPDM sports tiles carry Class Efl or Cfl-s1 classification as appropriate to the product specification. Membriko provides relevant product fire classification declarations for building permit and DGEstE documentation requirements.

## Section 12: Colour and Marking Options

### The Membriko Colour Range — Inorganic Pigments for All Outdoor Applications

Membriko specifies inorganic pigments exclusively for all EPDM granulate used in outdoor sports surface applications. This is not a stylistic choice — it is a technical decision driven by Portugal's UV exposure levels. Organic pigments used in lower-cost competing systems fade from vivid, saturated colour to a washed-out, degraded appearance within three to five years in high-UV environments. Inorganic pigments — iron oxides, chromium oxides, titanium dioxide — are chemically stable under any UV intensity. Membriko's red athletics track surfaces at year twelve look essentially the same as they did at installation.

**Standard colour range for outdoor EPDM sports surfaces:**

- **Red / Terracotta** — The classic athletics track colour; iron oxide red and iron oxide terracotta pigments; UV-stable indefinitely. Membriko's red tracks satisfy FPA visual requirements for sanctioned competition facilities.
- **Blue** — Common for multi-sport courts and tennis courts; modified cobalt pigment system; UV-stable. Popular in municipal facilities where a contemporary, non-athletics palette is preferred.
- **Green** — Multi-sport courts and tennis facilities; chromium oxide pigment; UV-stable. Creates a naturalistic aesthetic that integrates with planted surroundings.
- **Grey / Anthracite** — Contemporary, neutral palette suitable for all sports; carbon black and titanium dioxide; UV-stable. Increasingly specified for high-specification municipal and private facilities.
- **Black** — Maximum solar absorption; pure carbon black. Specified for weight training zones and contemporary design facilities.
- **Yellow / Orange** — Primarily for line marking inlays; iron oxide yellow and orange pigments; UV-stable. Used to create high-contrast marking on darker base surface colours.

Additional colours — including white, burgundy, and custom formulations — are available subject to supplier confirmation. Membriko advises on standard availability lead times versus non-standard colour procurement during the specification stage.

### Line Marking Options

**EPDM inlay line markings (colour-in-colour)** are the first choice for all fixed multi-sport markings. Contrasting EPDM granulate is applied wet-in-wet during wearing course installation, producing markings that are co-planar with the surface, physically embedded in the wearing course, and subject to the same UV stability and 15–20-year service life as the surface itself. No repainting required over the surface life. Membriko recommends inlay markings for all athletics track lane lines, sector lines, and standard court markings where the layout will not change.

**UV-stable polyurethane paint markings** are applied over the cured EPDM surface. Lower initial cost than EPDM inlay, but requiring reapplication every 3–5 years in Portuguese conditions. Membriko recommends painted markings for multi-sport courts where the marking configuration changes over time — for example, school PE courts that rotate between football, basketball, and badminton configurations across different academic terms.

**Logo and graphic elements** — club crests, municipality coats of arms, sport-specific graphic zones — can be incorporated into the EPDM surface in contrasting granulate colours using laser-cut stencils and wet-in-wet granulate application. The result is a permanent, UV-stable design element with the same service life as the surface. Membriko has carried out custom graphic installations for athletics clubs, school facilities, and hotel sports centres across Portugal.

### Accessibility Markings

Tactile guidance routes and colour contrast zones for visually impaired athletes and facility users can be incorporated into EPDM surfaces during installation using contrasting granulate colours. Membriko consults applicable Portuguese accessibility standards during the specification of facilities that have specific accessibility design obligations.

## Section 13: Indoor versus Outdoor Applications

### Outdoor Sports Surfaces

Outdoor sports applications — running tracks, multi-sport courts, and tennis courts — present the most demanding conditions for any surface material. Membriko's specification approach for outdoor surfaces is governed by three primary requirements:

**UV stability above all else.** Inorganic pigments are mandatory in every Membriko outdoor EPDM specification, regardless of what colour the client selects. There are no exceptions. The cost difference between inorganic and organic pigments is marginal against the cost of premature resurfacing driven by colour degradation.

**Porous drainage design.** Outdoor surfaces are exposed to precipitation, and porous EPDM systems — maintaining surface permeability of ≥ 2 cm/min — are the Membriko standard for outdoor tracks and courts. Non-porous outdoor systems are only specified where drainage gradient and perimeter channel capacity are sufficient to manage runoff without surface water accumulation.

**Thermal cycling tolerance.** EPDM's service temperature range of −30°C to +80°C covers the full range of surface temperatures that Portuguese sports facilities experience, from winter frost in the Beira Alta to summer afternoon heating in the Alentejo. The material does not crack, delaminate, or permanently deform across this range, provided the installation includes appropriate expansion accommodation at perimeter edges.

**Applicable standards:** EN 14877 (outdoor synthetic surfaces for sport), World Athletics Track and Field Facilities Manual (running tracks), ITF Surface Pace Rating procedure (tennis courts).

### Indoor Sports Surfaces

Indoor gymnasium and sports hall applications share the requirement for mechanical performance compliance but have a distinct set of additional requirements:

**Fire reaction classification** is mandatory for all indoor sports flooring under EN 13501-1. Membriko's indoor EPDM gymnasium tiles are classified to Class Efl or Cfl-s1 as appropriate. Clients undertaking school, municipal, or publicly funded indoor gymnasium installations should confirm the fire classification requirement with their building control authority at specification stage; Membriko provides the relevant product declarations.

**Ball rebound performance** matters for gymnasiums used for court sports. EN 14904 specifies ball rebound requirements for indoor sports hall floors. Membriko's gymnasium EPDM systems for multipurpose sports hall applications are formulated to achieve compliant vertical ball rebound, enabling use for basketball, volleyball, and handball alongside gym and fitness activities.

**Acoustic performance** may be specified for indoor sports halls in educational buildings under EN ISO 10846. Where acoustic impact attenuation is required, Membriko specifies appropriate EPDM underlayer thickness and density to contribute to the required impact sound insulation.

**Static load capacity** is a specific concern for gymnasiums with heavy strength training equipment. Membriko's 12 mm high-density gymnasium tiles are specified for permanent static loads up to 400 kg per machine contact point, with a specific gravity formulation that resists permanent compression set under sustained loading.

**UV stability is not required indoors.** Without UV exposure, a broader range of pigments is acceptable for indoor EPDM applications. This widens the available colour palette for indoor gymnasium design where colour matching to institutional identity is important.

### Hybrid Applications

Sports halls with glazed rooflight areas, semi-open courts, and covered outdoor spaces occupy a zone between fully indoor and fully outdoor conditions. Where EPDM flooring in any enclosed space receives direct UV exposure — through roof lights, open sides, or glazed facades — Membriko applies the outdoor specification, including inorganic pigments and UV stability testing. Membriko assesses the UV exposure classification of hybrid spaces at the specification stage and advises accordingly.

### Renovation Considerations

Outdoor renovation over existing asphalt or concrete is frequently viable and cost-effective, provided the substrate meets the structural and planarity requirements assessed at the technical survey stage. Membriko can apply new EPDM systems directly over existing asphalt athletics tracks and concrete courts in sound condition, avoiding the cost and disruption of full substrate removal. The economic case for renovation over new construction is often compelling — particularly for school and municipal budgets — and Membriko prepares a comparative cost analysis as part of the design stage.

Indoor gymnasium renovation typically requires the removal of existing wood sports flooring before EPDM application, as wood substrates are moisture-sensitive and dimensionally unstable under the bonded EPDM system. Existing rubber tile or sheet flooring in sound condition may be suitable as a substrate for bonded EPDM renovation; Membriko assesses substrate suitability during the technical survey.

## Section 14: Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Membriko install running tracks to World Athletics certification standards?**

Yes. Membriko installs EPDM and hybrid EPDM/polyurethane running track systems compatible with World Athletics Class 2 and Class 3 requirements — the two classes applicable to the vast majority of athletics tracks in Portugal, from club facilities to national championship venues. Membriko provides the complete World Athletics certification pathway: certified system specification, accredited laboratory test coordination, performance results compilation, and documentation preparation for submission to the World Athletics facility certification process in liaison with FPA. Athletics clubs and municipalities that need their track certified for FPA-sanctioned competition should contact Membriko at the project planning stage to build the certification timeline into the project programme.

**What is the service life of an EPDM sports surface in Portuguese conditions?**

Correctly specified and properly installed EPDM sports surfaces achieve 15–20 years of service life in Portuguese conditions. The principal limiting factor is wearing course surface erosion under intensive use — not UV degradation, thermal cycling, or chemical attack. Running tracks at club level (200–400 training sessions per week) consistently achieve 18–20 years before resurfacing is warranted. High-traffic school tracks, where intensive daily PE lesson use is combined with after-school club training, may require resurfacing at 12–15 years. Multi-sport courts with lower traffic intensity typically achieve the upper end of the service life range. Membriko's 15-year installation warranty reflects confidence in these service life expectations under normal use conditions.

**Can EPDM be applied over an existing asphalt athletics track?**

In many cases, yes. The key condition is that the existing asphalt substrate is in sound structural condition: no active delamination of asphalt layers, no significant differential settlement, no drainage failures that have undermined the sub-base, and no severe surface cracking that would propagate through the new EPDM layer. Where cracks exist, Membriko repairs them with flexible elastomeric compound before EPDM application. The surface is primed to ensure adhesion of the EPDM system. Renovation over existing asphalt avoids the cost and programme time of full sub-base reconstruction — typically saving 25–35% of total project cost. Membriko carries out a technical assessment of every existing asphalt track before confirming suitability; this is part of the initial site survey at no charge.

**What EPDM thickness is needed for an outdoor basketball or futsal court?**

Outdoor multi-sport courts for basketball and futsal are typically specified at 8–12 mm total EPDM system thickness. The appropriate thickness within that range depends primarily on the stiffness of the sub-base: courts on concrete sub-base require less EPDM thickness to achieve a given ball rebound specification than courts on weaker asphalt or aggregate bases. Membriko designs the EPDM system thickness for each court to achieve EN 14877-compliant ball rebound and friction values under the specific conditions of the project. A court specified at 8 mm on a concrete sub-base and a court specified at 12 mm on an asphalt sub-base can achieve identical certified performance — the EPDM thickness compensates for the substrate variable.

**Does red EPDM athletics track surfacing fade in the Portuguese sun?**

No — when the correct material is specified. Sports-grade EPDM supplied by Membriko for all outdoor athletics track applications uses iron oxide inorganic pigments for red, terracotta, and orange colours. Iron oxide pigments are chemically stable under UV radiation of any intensity: they contain no UV-labile organic bonds. Accelerated weathering tests to EN ISO 4892-3 (2,000+ hours, xenon arc — equivalent to approximately 15 years of Portuguese outdoor UV) show no measurable colour change. The visual degradation of athletics tracks that clients describe — faded, washed-out red that has turned pink or orange-brown within four or five years — is the characteristic of organic pigments or low-quality pigment loading, not of the inorganic pigment system Membriko specifies. Membriko does not use organic pigments in any outdoor EPDM sports surface application.

**Can EPDM be used in a gymnasium with heavy weightlifting and barbell drops?**

Yes — and EPDM is the globally established standard material for this application. The combination of high static load (strength equipment frames, machines, and loaded barbells) and high-energy impact (dropped barbells and dumbbells from height) that characterises a free weights zone requires a flooring material that resists permanent deformation under sustained static load while absorbing impact without delaminating from the substrate or transmitting excessive impulse to the concrete slab. Membriko recommends 12 mm high-density EPDM (specific gravity ≥ 1.4) for zones with regular Olympic barbell drops; 8 mm EPDM for cardio equipment and functional training areas; and 6 mm EPDM for stretching, yoga, and low-impact zones. High-density formulation is critical for free weight zones — standard-density 12 mm EPDM without the higher specific gravity specification will eventually develop permanent compression under weight racks and machine base plates.

**What public funding programmes are available for sports surface construction in Portugal?**

The principal public funding programme for sports facility surface renovation in Portugal is PACED (Programa de Apoio à Modernização e Capacitação dos Equipamentos Desportivos), managed by IPDJ (Instituto Português do Desporto e da Juventude). PACED co-funds the renovation of municipal sports infrastructure, including athletics track resurfacing, multi-sport court construction, and gymnasium flooring replacement. Applications require a detailed technical specification of the surfaces to be installed with reference to applicable European standards, evidence of contractor qualifications, and a commitment to post-installation performance verification. Membriko has direct experience supporting municipalities through the PACED documentation process and can prepare the technical specification in the format required. Contact Membriko in Pombal at the earliest stage of your PACED application — the specification documentation is prepared as part of the project process and does not incur additional charges.

**How long does it take to install a 400-metre EPDM athletics track?**

Renovation of a 400-metre athletics track — applying a new EPDM system over a prepared existing asphalt surface — typically takes 10–15 working days from the start of base preparation to completion of line markings. The critical variable is weather: the polyurethane binder used in both the base course and the wearing course is sensitive to temperature and relative humidity during application and curing. Optimal application conditions are 10–25°C ambient temperature and relative humidity below 75%. In Portuguese conditions, spring (March to May) and autumn (September to October) typically offer the most reliable installation windows. New-build tracks with sub-base construction add 5–10 working days. The completed track is available for use 48–72 hours after application of the final wearing course, once the PU binder has achieved full cure strength. Membriko provides a detailed installation programme with milestone dates at the project design stage.
