# Sports Surfaces — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Sports surfaces occupy a distinct position in Membriko's application portfolio. The audience is
highly segmented — ranging from municipal engineers specifying a secondary school running track
to professional athletics club managers seeking World Athletics certification, from gym owners
selecting functional fitness flooring to concelhos investing in multi-sport courts for their
communities. What unites these audiences is that they are all professional or semi-professional
procurement decisions. No one is buying a sports surface on impulse.

The page must therefore satisfy two distinct information requirements simultaneously:

1. **Technical credibility for specifiers:** Engineers, architects working with municipal
   clients, sports facility managers, and FPA (Federação Portuguesa de Atletismo) officials
   need performance data, standard references (World Athletics, EN 14877, EN 14904), and
   installation process confidence. They are evaluating Membriko against other contractors.

2. **Mission-alignment for institutional buyers:** Municipalities, school administrations,
   and sports clubs are making decisions that affect public money and public safety. They need
   to understand that EPDM is the established, certified, durable choice — not an experiment.
   Portuguese sports infrastructure funding (IPDJ/PACED programmes) requires documented
   material and system specifications.

The page should open with the problem that resonates across all these audiences: Portugal's
significant stock of ageing sports surfaces in schools and municipal facilities — worn asphalt
tracks, broken concrete courts, faded and degraded synthetic surfaces — that are limiting athletic
activity and creating safety and compliance issues. Membriko's EPDM solution is positioned as
the renovation and new-build answer that delivers proven performance for 15-20+ years.

The persuasion arc: problem of ageing Portuguese sports surfaces → EPDM's unique fitness for
sports applications → surface type and application diversity → World Athletics and EN standards
compliance → EPDM vs alternative materials → installation discipline → technical specifications
→ maintenance economics → regulatory context → colour and design → indoor vs outdoor → FAQs.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Sports Infrastructure and the Surface Problem

**Purpose:** Establish the scale of Portugal's sports surface challenge and position Membriko
as the specialist solution provider.

**Content:**
- Open with the state of Portugal's sports surface infrastructure: the school running tracks
  that crack and fade within 10 years of installation, the municipal multi-sport courts used
  daily by communities whose surfaces have exceeded service life, the club athletics tracks
  that hold back athlete performance and deter World Athletics certification
- The Membriko proposition: EPDM rubber surfaces designed and installed to World Athletics,
  EN 14877 and EN 14904 standards, with 15-20 year service life and minimal maintenance
  requirements, from Pombal serving the whole of Portugal
- Stat block: 15-20 year service life / World Athletics compatible / 15+ colour options /
  EN 14877 certified systems
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Orçamento para Superfície Desportiva"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Sports Surfaces

**Purpose:** Establish the material science case for EPDM over alternatives in sports
surface applications.

**Content:**
- The three competing demands of sports surfaces: shock absorption (joint protection),
  energy return (athletic performance), and durability (resistance to UV, thermal cycling,
  mechanical wear)
- Why EPDM uniquely satisfies all three: the rubber elastomer network provides elastic energy
  storage and return; the saturated backbone resists UV without degradation; the vulcanised
  cross-link structure maintains mechanical properties across -30°C to +80°C service range
- Key distinction from polyurethane alternatives: EPDM granulate is colour-stable with
  inorganic pigments (UV-proof for 15+ years in Portuguese conditions); aromatic PU systems
  yellow significantly under Portugal's high UV load
- Physical data table:
  | Property | Sports-Grade EPDM | Test Method |
  |---|---|---|
  | Force reduction (shock absorption) | 35-50% (track-dependent) | EN 14809 |
  | Vertical deformation | 0.6-2.0 mm | EN 14808 |
  | Energy return | ≥ 50% | EN 14808 |
  | Friction coefficient (wet) | 0.47-0.65 | EN 13036-4 |
  | UV colour stability | No fading at 2,000+ hours | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Service temperature range | -30°C to +80°C | — |
  | Service life | 15-20 years | — |
- Portugal-specific advantage: UV stability is critical in southern Portugal; EPDM's inorganic
  pigment system outperforms organic pigment alternatives by 3-5x in UV resistance

## Section 3: Surface Types — Running Tracks, Multi-Sport Courts, Gym Flooring, Tennis Courts

**Purpose:** Show full application range — Membriko is not a single-product specialist.

**Content:** Four surface type cards.

**Running Tracks (Pistas de Atletismo)**
- Context: 400 m standard tracks at municipal and club level; also 60-200 m straight tracks
  at schools; World Athletics classification Classes 1, 2, 3
- EPDM specification: World Athletics Class 3 (school/club) uses Type 2 full-pour porous
  EPDM system (12-15 mm); Class 2-3 competition uses Type 3 hybrid system (12-16 mm)
- Key performance: force reduction 35-50%; spike penetration resistance; rain-fast drainage
  (porous EPDM drains in 30-60 minutes)

**Multi-Sport Courts (Campos Polidesportivos)**
- Context: basketball, futsal, volleyball, netball, handball courts at school and municipal
  level; typically 20x40 m (full court) or smaller; outdoor use year-round
- EPDM specification: 8-12 mm poured EPDM system with specific colour zones for sport
  demarcation; or coloured EPDM overlay on existing concrete/tarmac base
- Key performance: ball rebound consistency; anti-slip wet performance; UV-stable line
  marking with contrasting EPDM colours

**Gym and Fitness Flooring (Pavilhões de Desporto e Ginásios)**
- Context: school gymnasiums, municipal fitness centres, functional training facilities,
  CrossFit-type boxes; indoor application; weight impact, machine static load, rapid lateral
  movement all in the same space
- EPDM specification: 6-12 mm EPDM tiles (500x500 mm or 1000x1000 mm) or rolls;
  interlocking or bonded to substrate; higher density formulation for weight room zones
- Key performance: high static load resistance; energy absorption for dropped weights;
  anti-fatigue for standing work; easy cleaning with neutral detergent

**Tennis Courts (Courts de Ténis)**
- Context: indoor and outdoor tennis courts for clubs, hotels, and residential facilities;
  ITF (International Tennis Federation) surface classifications; specific ball bounce and
  sliding properties required
- EPDM specification: 8-10 mm textured EPDM system formulated for ITF surface category
  (typically Category 2 — medium pace); consistent horizontal ball rebound; controlled
  shoe sliding
- Key performance: consistent ball response in wet and dry conditions; UV colour stability
  for long court marking life; anti-slip toe-drag resistance

---

## Section 4: Performance Characteristics — Shock Absorption, Energy Return, Slip Resistance

**Purpose:** Provide the technical depth that specifiers and athletic club managers require.

**Content:**
- Shock absorption mechanism: the open-cell porous EPDM granulate structure acts as a
  controlled-stiffness spring — impact energy compresses the granulate, the rubber network
  stores energy elastically, partial energy dissipation protects joints. Force reduction
  of 35-50% is the World Athletics target range.
- Energy return: unlike foam-based systems that dissipate most energy as heat, the vulcanised
  EPDM rubber network returns ≥50% of stored energy to the athlete. This is the "fast track"
  characteristic that elite athletes require. Athletes report noticeably less fatigue on
  properly specified EPDM tracks vs concrete or poor-quality synthetic surfaces.
- Slip resistance: EPDM's surface texture (from granulate surface relief) provides consistent
  friction even when wet. Tested to EN 13036-4; target 0.47-0.65 wet friction. Non-porous
  surfaces (painted concrete, asphalt) are significantly more slippery when wet.
- Temperature effects: at 65°C summer surface temperature (Portuguese conditions), EPDM
  maintains performance within specification tolerance. Polyurethane systems (particularly
  aromatic formulations) soften measurably at these temperatures, affecting performance
  consistency and increasing spike damage risk.

## Section 5: Installation Process

**Purpose:** De-risk the procurement decision by making Membriko's installation process
feel systematic, professional, and accountable.

**Content:** Numbered timeline (6 steps).

1. **Vistoria Técnica e Levantamento** — Site survey: existing surface condition assessment,
   sub-base evaluation, drainage audit, geometric survey (flatness, gradients), neighbouring
   infrastructure that affects project scope

2. **Projeto e Especificação** — Surface design: surface type selection, thickness specification
   to meet World Athletics or EN performance class, colour design and line marking layout,
   drainage design, materials specification and BOM

3. **Preparação da Base** — Base preparation: existing surface removal or preparation (crack
   repair, grinding, cleaning); sub-base repair if required; drainage layer installation;
   primer application for EPDM adhesion

4. **Aplicação da Camada Base** — Base layer installation: SBR/EPDM granulate + PU binder
   base course application; mechanical screeding to design thickness; curing (24-48 hours
   temperature dependent)

5. **Camada de Acabamento e Linhas** — Wearing course and marking: EPDM granulate wearing
   course application; sport line marking in contrasting EPDM colours or polyurethane paint;
   perimeter edging and drainage channel finishing

6. **Testes e Entrega** — Performance testing and handover: mechanical performance tests
   (force reduction, vertical deformation, friction) per relevant standard; World Athletics
   or EN documentation where required; 15-year Membriko installation warranty certificate

---

## Section 6: IAAF / World Athletics Specifications

**Purpose:** Demonstrate Membriko's knowledge of the regulatory certification framework —
critical for athletics club and municipal clients seeking competition-ready tracks.

**Content:**
- World Athletics classification system explained: Classes 1, 2, 3 — requirements, use cases,
  and testing protocols
- Key mechanical parameters and their meaning for athlete performance and joint health
- Membriko's process for delivering World Athletics Class 3 (most common in Portugal) and
  Class 2 tracks: certified EPDM/PU systems; documentation for submission to World Athletics
  certification process; testing by accredited laboratory
- FPA (Federação Portuguesa de Atletismo) requirements for club tracks hosting regional
  competition
- Note on IPDJ/PACED funding: public funding programmes often require certified surface
  systems and Membriko can provide the specification documentation required for funding
  applications

## Section 7: EPDM vs Polyurethane / Acrylic / Artificial Turf

**Purpose:** Proactively handle competitor material comparisons in a factual, credible way.

**Content:** Comparison table with 6 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Full-Pour PU | Acrylic Coating | Artificial Turf |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UV colour stability | Excellent — 15+ years | Moderate (aromatic) / Good (aliphatic) | Poor — 5-8 years | Good (fibres) |
| Surface temperature resistance | Excellent — to +80°C | Moderate — softens at >60°C | Excellent | Good |
| Shock absorption | Excellent — adjustable | Good | None (coating only) | Good (with infill) |
| Installation temperature sensitivity | Moderate | High — isocyanate cure affected | Low | Low |
| Repairability | Good — localised patches | Poor — section replacement | Good | Moderate |
| Service life | 15-20 years | 10-15 years | 5-8 years | 8-12 years |

Honest acknowledgement: full-pour aliphatic PU systems deliver excellent performance and are the
standard specification for World Athletics Class 1 tracks. Artificial turf with EPDM infill is
the correct choice for football, rugby and field hockey pitches. Membriko works with clients to
specify the right surface system for each application — not to fit every application to a single
product.

## Section 8: Drainage Under Sports Surfaces

**Purpose:** Address drainage — a critical and often underspecified element of sports surface
installations, especially relevant in Portugal's seasonal precipitation context.

**Content:**
- Why drainage matters: standing water on sports surfaces creates injury risk (slip, fall),
  bacteria and algae growth, and frost/thaw damage to the base; Portuguese autumn rain events
  can deliver 50-80 mm in a few hours
- Porous EPDM surface drainage: open-grade EPDM granulate systems drain at 2-5 cm/min
  (surface layer); water passes through to sub-base drainage layer
- Sub-base drainage design: perforated drainage pipes beneath the EPDM base course; gradient
  design (minimum 0.5% cross-fall for tracks; 0.8-1.0% for courts); connection to site
  stormwater drainage
- Track drainage specifics: the 400 m athletics track geometry (banked curves, superelevation)
  requires careful drainage design to prevent water pooling at the low point of each curve
- Court drainage specifics: multi-sport courts require consistent cross-fall without affecting
  ball roll; Membriko designs drainage to EN 14877 drainage performance requirements
- Perimeter drainage channels: aluminium or HDPE channels at the track/court perimeter
  capturing surface and sub-surface drainage flows

## Section 10: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate low maintenance cost — a key economic advantage over alternatives.

**Content:**
- Routine maintenance: annual brushing with mechanical sweeper to remove compacted debris
  and maintain surface porosity; pressure washing (80-100 bar maximum) for biological fouling
  (algae, moss) — applicable particularly to shaded areas of tracks and courts in northern
  Portugal
- Line marking maintenance: EPDM inlay lines (colour-in-colour EPDM) do not require repainting;
  painted lines require reapplication every 3-5 years under Portuguese UV conditions
- Biological growth management: porous EPDM surfaces can develop algae in shaded areas;
  treatment with diluted sodium hypochlorite (pool shock) or biocide solution is compatible
  with EPDM and removes biological fouling without surface damage
- Repair procedure: isolated damage (vandalism cut, impact damage from heavy object) can be
  patched with bonded EPDM granulate repair compound; larger damaged zones require section
  removal and re-pour; seam and edge damage repaired with PU adhesive and EPDM patch
- Maintenance schedule table:
  | Task | Frequency | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | Debris clearing (mechanical sweep) | Monthly | Maintains drainage porosity |
  | Pressure washing (biological) | Annual | 80-100 bar maximum |
  | Line marking inspection | Annual | Repaint if required (painted lines) |
  | Drainage channel cleaning | Annual | Before winter rain season |
  | Full surface inspection | Annual (spring) | Document and report condition |
- Membriko annual maintenance contract: optional preventive maintenance contract including
  inspection, cleaning, drain clearing, and minor repair

## Section 11: Portuguese Sports Facility Regulations

**Purpose:** Provide the regulatory context that institutional buyers — municipalities,
schools, sports federations — need to confirm compliance.

**Content:**
- RJID (Regime Jurídico das Instalações Desportivas) — Decreto-Lei 10/2009: Legal framework
  for sports facility design, construction and operation in Portugal. Sets surface performance
  minimum requirements for publicly funded sports facilities. EPDM systems specified to EN
  14877 and World Athletics standards satisfy RJID requirements.
- IPDJ (Instituto Português do Desporto e da Juventude) funding programmes: PACED and
  equivalent programmes require documented material specifications and certified performance
  data. Membriko provides full documentation package for funding applications.
- FPA certification track requirements: Federação Portuguesa de Atletismo requires World
  Athletics-compatible track surfaces for any competition sanctioning. Class 3 minimum for
  regional and national events.
- School sports facility standards: Direção-Geral dos Estabelecimentos Escolares (DGEstE)
  manages school sports infrastructure. School tracks and courts must meet RJID requirements.
  Membriko works with school management and municipality clients on DGEstE-compliant
  specifications.
- Safety standards: EN 1176 and EN 1177 apply to the interface between sports surfaces and
  any adjacent children's play equipment; where sports facilities are integrated with playground
  areas, Membriko coordinates specification across both surface types.
- Fire reaction: for indoor sports facilities, EN 13501-1 fire reaction classification applies;
  EPDM sports tiles for indoor use carry Class Efl or Cfl-s1 classification as appropriate.

---

## Section 12: Colour and Marking Options

**Purpose:** Address the design and visual identity dimension of sports facilities —
particularly relevant for schools and clubs who wish to express their identity through
their facilities.

**Content:**
- Standard colour range: red (classic athletics track), blue (common multi-sport court, swimming
  pool surrounds), green (multi-sport, aesthetically natural), grey/anthracite (contemporary,
  all-sport neutral), black (minimalist, premium), terracotta (Iberian aesthetic), yellow, orange
- Line marking options:
  - EPDM colour-in-colour inlay: contrasting EPDM lines applied wet-in-wet during surface
    installation; permanent, UV-stable, never requires repainting; higher initial cost but
    lowest 15-year total cost
  - Polyurethane line paint: applied over cured EPDM surface; requires repainting every
    3-5 years under Portuguese UV; lower initial cost
- Logo and sport zone graphics: custom EPDM designs can incorporate school/club logos, zone
  colours, and sport-specific markings in contrasting EPDM granulate colours
- ITF surface colour requirements for tennis: ITF recommendations for court colour; Membriko
  advises on compliant colour selections
- Accessibility markings: tactile guidance routes and colour contrast for visually impaired
  athletes can be incorporated into EPDM surface designs

---

## Section 13: Indoor vs Outdoor Applications

**Purpose:** Clarify the different requirements, specifications and installation approaches
for indoor and outdoor sports surfaces — a common point of confusion.

**Content:**
- Outdoor sports surfaces (tracks, courts, artificial turf bases):
  - UV stability is the primary material selection driver
  - Drainage design is essential — porous EPDM preferred
  - Thermal cycling tolerance required (-5°C to +70°C surface temperatures in Portugal)
  - World Athletics, EN 14877 standards apply
  - EPDM colour range selected for outdoor UV stability (inorganic pigments mandatory)
- Indoor sports surfaces (gymnasiums, fitness centres, multipurpose halls):
  - Fire reaction classification required (EN 13501-1)
  - Ball rebound consistency important (EN 14904 for sports halls)
  - Indoor humidity and temperature are controlled — no UV stability requirement
  - Acoustic performance may be relevant (EN ISO 10846)
  - Wider colour range possible (organic pigments acceptable indoors)
  - Static load capacity important for gymnasium equipment
- Hybrid applications (sports halls with outdoor access, covered courts):
  - Where an indoor surface receives any direct UV exposure (roof lights, open sides),
    UV stability requirements apply
  - Membriko advises on exposure classification at the specification stage
- Renovation considerations:
  - Outdoor: can often be installed over existing asphalt or concrete base with appropriate
    preparation
  - Indoor: typically requires existing substrate levelling and adhesion preparation; wood
    sports floors require removal before EPDM application

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales queries.

1. **A Membriko instala pistas de atletismo com certificação World Athletics?**
   Yes. Membriko installs EPDM/polyurethane running track systems compatible with World
   Athletics Class 2 and Class 3 requirements. The company provides the complete specification
   documentation, performance test coordination with accredited laboratories, and post-
   installation certification support required for World Athletics facility approval.

2. **Qual é a vida útil de um pavimento desportivo EPDM em Portugal?**
   Well-designed and correctly installed EPDM sports surfaces achieve 15-20 years service life
   in Portuguese conditions. The limiting factor is typically wearing course surface erosion
   from intensive use, not UV or chemical degradation. Tracks with moderate traffic (club
   level, 200-400 athlete sessions per week) consistently achieve 18-20 years before resurfacing
   is warranted. High-traffic school tracks may require resurfacing at 12-15 years.

3. **É possível aplicar EPDM sobre uma pista de atletismo de asfalto existente?**
   Yes, in many cases. The existing asphalt surface must be in sound structural condition —
   no active delamination, no drainage failures, no significant differential settlement. Cracks
   are repaired with flexible compound and the surface is primed before EPDM application.
   Renovation over existing asphalt is typically faster and less expensive than full removal
   and reconstruction. Membriko carries out a technical assessment of the existing surface
   before confirming suitability.

4. **Que espessura de EPDM é necessária para um campo de basquetebol ao ar livre?**
   Outdoor multi-sport courts for basketball and futsal are typically specified at 8-12 mm
   total EPDM system thickness. The exact specification depends on the sub-base stiffness —
   courts on concrete sub-base require less EPDM thickness for equivalent ball response than
   courts on weaker sub-base materials. Membriko designs thickness to achieve EN 14877
   compliant ball rebound and friction values on each project's specific conditions.

5. **O EPDM de cor vermelha (pista de atletismo) desvanece com o sol português?**
   No. Sports-grade EPDM supplied by Membriko uses inorganic iron oxide pigments for red,
   orange and terracotta colours. These pigments are UV-stable in accelerated weathering tests
   to 2,000+ hours (EN ISO 4892-3, xenon arc) — equivalent to 15+ years of Portuguese outdoor
   UV exposure. Organic pigments (used in lower-cost competing systems) fade significantly
   within 3-5 years in high UV environments. Membriko specifies only inorganic pigment EPDM
   for all outdoor applications.

6. **Posso usar EPDM num ginásio com halterofilismo e queda de pesos?**
   Yes — weight room and functional fitness applications are one of the most demanding EPDM
   use cases, and EPDM is the established standard material globally. Membriko recommends
   12 mm EPDM tiles or rolls for zones with regular barbell and dumbbell dropping; 8 mm for
   general fitness floor areas; and 6 mm for stretching and low-impact zones. High-density
   EPDM formulation (specific gravity ≥ 1.4) is specified for weight room applications to
   resist permanent compression set under static equipment loads.

7. **Quais são os programas de financiamento público para obras de pavimento desportivo em Portugal?**
   The principal public funding programme is PACED (Programa de Apoio à Modernização e
   Capacitação dos Equipamentos Desportivos), managed by IPDJ. It co-funds renovation of
   municipal sports infrastructure including athletics tracks and multi-sport courts.
   Applications require certified surface specifications and contractor qualifications.
   Membriko has experience supporting municipalities through the PACED documentation process
   and can provide technical specifications in the format required.

8. **Quanto tempo demora a instalar uma pista de atletismo de 400 m com EPDM?**
   A standard 400 m athletics track renovation (EPDM system applied over prepared existing
   surface) takes 10-15 working days from start of base preparation to completion of line
   marking, depending on weather conditions (PU binder cure is temperature and humidity
   sensitive). New-build tracks with sub-base construction add 5-10 additional working days.
   The track is ready for use 48-72 hours after final wearing course application, once the
   PU binder has fully cured. Membriko provides a firm installation programme at the project
   design stage.
