# Agricultural Reservoir Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Portuguese Agriculture's Water Crisis

By July, the Alentejo has dried out. The streams that ran full in January have retreated
beneath stone and sand. Farm ponds are dropping week by week. The boreholes that once powered
the centre-pivot irrigation systems are delivering lower flow rates. And across the fields that
depend on summer irrigation — the young olive groves, the converted vineyards, the market gardens
that supply Portugal's fresh produce market — the pressure on available water becomes the single
variable that determines whether a growing season survives.

Portugal's mean annual rainfall of 900 mm is distributed with extreme regional inequality. The
Alentejo and Algarve receive 400-600 mm per year, almost exclusively between October and April.
Agriculture accounts for 74% of Portugal's total freshwater consumption. The extension of irrigated
crops — olives, vines, citrus, industrial tomato, market vegetables — into the Alentejo interior
deepens the imbalance between water supply and demand with each passing season.

Farm reservoirs — charcas (farm ponds), açudes (check dams), tanques de rega (irrigation tanks),
and lagoas de retenção (retention lagoons) — are the structural response to this deficit. They
capture winter rainfall and hold it for summer irrigation. The problem is that most agricultural
reservoirs in Portugal lose between 20% and 60% of stored volume through soil infiltration before
that water ever reaches the crop. An unlined 15,000 m³ charca can lose 4,500 m³ per year — simply
through the base and slopes — in the expansive clay soils of the Alentejo interior.

Membriko, based in Pombal at the geographical heart of Portugal, works exclusively with EPDM
membrane because it is the only waterproofing system that eliminates infiltration losses permanently,
in any type of agricultural reservoir, for 50 years or more. This page explains why — with the
technical honesty that Membriko brings to every client engagement, from the smallholder who needs
to line a 500 m² farm pond to the agricultural enterprise managing retention lagoons of 50,000 m³.

## Why EPDM is the Right Solution for Agricultural Reservoirs

An agricultural reservoir demands more of a waterproofing membrane than almost any other
construction application. The membrane must simultaneously resist:

- **Direct, continuous UV radiation** on the freeboard (the zone above the waterline) and
  embankment crest, without the protection of water depth, for decades of exposure to
  Portuguese summer sun at southern European irradiance levels
- **Chemically variable water:** water containing dissolved fertilisers, herbicide and pesticide
  residues at trace concentrations, organic matter, suspended sediment — the exact composition
  depending on the catchment and the farm's agrochemical practices
- **Ground movement:** slope settlement after reservoir filling, seasonal shrink-swell in
  clay soils, livestock trampling at the watering point on the embankment margin
- **Extreme thermal cycling:** from -5°C on winter nights in the Alentejo interior to +50°C
  on the exposed membrane surface in August without cooling water

No other waterproofing material addresses all of these stresses simultaneously with EPDM's
effectiveness. The reason is chemical, not commercial.

### The Chemistry That Guarantees Durability

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic rubber elastomer whose primary polymer
chain consists exclusively of carbon-carbon single bonds and carbon-hydrogen bonds. This saturated
molecular architecture is chemically inert to oxidising agents, polar organic solvents, and dilute
acids and bases — precisely the compounds present in agricultural reservoir water.

Comparing the alternatives:

- **HDPE Geomembrane:** lower elongation than EPDM in unstable soil conditions; UV resistance
  dependent on HALS stabilisers that deplete over 25-35 years; field seaming requires thermal
  fusion equipment and controlled weather conditions — complex quality assurance in remote
  agricultural locations
- **Reinforced PVC:** contains 20-30% by weight of plasticisers that progressively migrate into
  water under UV and temperature; service life 10-20 years in exposed agricultural applications;
  APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) does not recommend PVC geomembranes for reservoirs near
  potable water catchments due to plasticiser migration concerns
- **Compacted clay (bentonite or natural):** traditional solution with low material cost but high
  seasonal infiltration; Alentejo clay soils (montmorillonite-dominant) crack in drought and can
  increase annual losses to 30-60% of stored volume; bentonite geocomposites (GCL) lose
  impermeability if they desiccate without overburden confinement — which occurs in reservoirs
  drawn down significantly in summer

## Reservoir Types — Farm Ponds, Irrigation Tanks, Check Dams, Retention Lagoons

### Charcas (Farm Ponds)

The charca is Portugal's most common agricultural reservoir: an earthen basin, typically
200-5,000 m² in surface area, formed by excavation or low embankment. Farm ponds collect
rainfall run-off from the catchment area, seasonal stream diversions, and sometimes borehole
pumping to supplement stored volume. In Portugal, most charcas were built on the assumption
that Alentejo clay soil would act as a natural seal.

This assumption fails predictably. Alentejo clay soils have high montmorillonite content —
expansive clays that absorb water and swell in winter, then crack in summer. A clay-sealed
farm pond may lose 20-30% of stored volume in winter (when soil is saturated and permeability
is low) and 40-60% in summer when desiccation cracks create preferential infiltration pathways.

Membriko installs 1.0 mm EPDM membrane over 200 g/m² protective geotextile in farm ponds of
any size and shape. EPDM's 400%+ elongation at break accommodates any basin geometry, including
the irregular shapes created by natural topography or unplanned excavation. Field seams are
made by cold vulcanisation using QuickSeam tape (150 mm width), without the electrical thermal
fusion equipment that HDPE seaming requires.

### Tanques de Rega (Irrigation Tanks)

Irrigation tanks are constructed structures — reinforced concrete, mass concrete or stone
masonry — used for short-term storage adjacent to the irrigation distribution point. They range
from 10 m³ on small holdings to 2,000 m³ on commercial market garden operations, typically
semi-buried or above grade.

Concrete and masonry crack with time, thermal cycling, and differential ground movement. A
0.1 mm crack in a concrete wall under 3 m of hydrostatic head represents a leak of tens of
litres per hour that progressively worsens. Conventional rehabilitation — polyurethane injection,
waterproof paint systems — has a service life of 3-7 years and requires periodic reapplication.

Membriko installs 1.5 mm EPDM membrane bonded to the tank interior with immersion-rated contact
adhesive. The installation eliminates infiltration without demolishing the existing structure,
backed by a 15-year Membriko warranty. The membrane thickness (1.5 mm) has negligible impact on
the tank's usable volume.

### Açudes (Check Dams)

Açudes are small dams built across seasonal watercourses, creating impoundments that capture and
retain winter floodwater. The Alentejo has thousands of açudes, many built in schist and granite
masonry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The progressive deterioration of mortar joints
over decades of wet-dry cycling reduces the impermeability of the upstream face and base.

Membriko installs 1.5 mm EPDM membrane on the upstream face and reservoir base of deteriorating
açudes, anchored at the dam crest and at the abutments with surrounding terrain. Penetration
details at the outlet pipe and overflow structure use EPDM compression flange fittings that create
both mechanical and chemical seals between the membrane and the pipework.

### Agricultural Retention Lagoons

Retention lagoons are large-scale storage reservoirs for intensive agricultural operations. They
are common in the Alentejo for industrial tomato, maize and pepper production, where seasonal
irrigation water requirements can reach 200,000-500,000 m³. Some lagoons serve collective
irrigation perimeters managed by irrigators' associations.

For lagoons exceeding 10,000 m² in surface area, Membriko works with factory-vulcanised EPDM
panels up to 15.25 m wide, minimising the number of field seams. Perimeter anchoring at the
embankment crest uses anchor trenches 400 mm deep minimum, with the membrane folded into the
trench and covered with compacted backfill. Membriko coordinates with the hydraulic structures
designer to integrate the waterproofing system with the spillway, outlet works, and level
monitoring instrumentation.

## Water Conservation in Alentejo and Algarve

The context could not be more concrete: the Alentejo and Algarve receive 400-600 mm of annual
precipitation, almost entirely between October and April. IPMA climate projections for 2050
point to a 10-20% reduction in mean annual precipitation across southern Portugal and a 30-40%
increase in drought frequency. Every litre of stored water is worth more than it was 20 years
ago — and will be worth more again in 20 years' time.

### The Real Cost of Infiltration

A 5,000 m² farm pond at 3 m average depth stores 15,000 m³ of water. In unlined clay soil,
annual infiltration can be 30-40% of volume — 4,500 to 6,000 m³ lost to the soil each year
before it reaches the field. The Portuguese agricultural water tariff ranges from €0.05 to
€0.20 per m³ depending on source and distribution system. At €0.10/m³, 4,500 m³ of annual
infiltration represents €450 per year in direct water cost.

But the true cost exceeds the tariff cost. In drought years, when boreholes decline or upstream
impoundments fail, the water that is not in the reservoir because it was absorbed by the soil
may render an entire irrigation season unviable. The loss is not €450 — it is the value of the
crop that did not grow.

### EPDM as a Water Resilience Investment

Membriko frames reservoir waterproofing not as a construction cost but as a water resilience
investment. A 5,000 m² farm pond lined with EPDM by Membriko delivers:
- Membrane and installation cost: approximately €15,000-25,000 (depending on access, shape
  and distance from Pombal)
- Annual water saving: 4,500-6,000 m³ × €0.10/m³ = €450-600 per year in direct avoided
  water cost; add the value of production secured by the preserved water
- Simple payback period: 5-8 years on tariff cost alone; 2-4 years accounting for the value
  of production protected
- Investment service life: 50+ years with a 15-year Membriko warranty

Under PDR2030 (Portugal's Rural Development Programme), where membrane waterproofing is
eligible as an investment cost with 40-65% support rates, the payback period on the farmer's
net investment reduces to 1-4 years.

## Installation Process for EPDM Agricultural Reservoirs

Membriko follows a systematic installation process developed for the specific conditions of
Portuguese agricultural reservoirs — which differ, in important respects, from industrial
reservoirs or swimming pools. Each stage has a defined technical purpose.

### Step 1: Technical Reservoir Survey

Before any quotation, Membriko carries out the technical reservoir survey. For existing farm
ponds, this includes:

- Topographic measurement: waterline perimeter, depth at key points, slope gradient and shape,
  inlet and outlet levels
- Soil investigation: soil type on slopes and base (clay-loam, silty, granular); visual
  assessment of slope stability; identification of rock outcrops or stone accumulations
  that could damage the membrane
- Hydraulic calculation: confirmation of existing or planned storage volume; simplified water
  balance to confirm volume is adequate for declared irrigation needs
- Penetration inventory: pump suction pipe, overflow, borehole supply inlet, level sensor

For new farm ponds, the technical survey precedes excavation and informs the design dimensions.
Membriko can contribute to optimising pond shape and depth relative to the required volume and
site topography.

### Step 2: Soil and Bed Preparation

Soil preparation is the step that most determines membrane longevity. Any stone, root, or
surface irregularity beneath the membrane can, over years of hydrostatic pressure and ground
movement, cause puncture. Membriko treats this phase with the same rigour as membrane
installation:

- **Compaction:** base and slopes are compacted to the specified Proctor density (typically
  95% modified Proctor for clay soils); correct compaction reduces differential settlement
  after filling
- **Foreign object removal:** manual removal of stones, roots and any sharp objects from
  the entire membrane contact zone; particular attention to rocky outcrops on the base where
  rock protrusions can create concentrated pressure points
- **Surface regularity:** the surface must be sufficiently regular for the geotextile to
  lie without severe folding; irregularities > 50 mm on a 2 m straightedge must be corrected
- **Slope protection in sandy soils:** in soils where the angle of repose is less than the
  planned slope gradient (1:2), Membriko assesses the need for slope reinforcement (geogrid,
  mechanical ripping) before membrane installation

### Step 3: Protective Geotextile Installation

The protective geotextile is the intermediary between the soil and the EPDM membrane. Membriko
uses 200 g/m² non-woven polypropylene geotextile (EN 13252) installed over the entire prepared
surface — base and slopes. The geotextile serves three functions:

- Protects the EPDM membrane from puncture by sub-surface stones not detected during clearing
- Distributes concentrated contact pressures from localised ground irregularities
- Acts as a gas drainage layer for biogenic carbon dioxide and methane from soil organic matter
  decomposition — without this drainage, gas pressure could push upward against the membrane

Geotextile seam overlaps are minimum 500 mm; at edges and anchor zones, the geotextile extends
beyond the EPDM membrane to prevent the exposed geotextile edge from pulling the membrane.

### Step 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Installation begins at the reservoir base with the widest panels. EPDM is transported in roll
form and unrolled in situ over the geotextile, with minimum 150 mm panel overlap at seam lines.
For regular-shaped farm ponds, Membriko optimises the panel layout to minimise seam count —
ideally, a single seam along the central axis of the base, with panels running uncut up both
main slopes.

Seams are made using QuickPrime Plus primer and 150 mm QuickSeam tape, applied under pressure
with a silicone roller to ensure full contact between tape, primer and membrane. Cold
vulcanisation seaming requires no electrical equipment — the process is chemical and suitable
for remote field installation without power access. Minimum ambient temperature for seaming
is 5°C; maximum is 45°C.

After the base panels are installed and seamed, the membrane is guided up the slopes, maintaining
adequate tension to eliminate folds. At corners and direction changes, Membriko cuts and seams
the membrane with pre-moulded EPDM patch pieces.

### Step 5: Crest Anchoring and Penetration Details

**Perimeter anchor trench:** at the top of the embankment or excavation cut, the membrane is
guided into an anchor trench minimum 300 mm deep and 300 mm wide, excavated at least 500 mm
from the inner slope edge. The membrane folds to the trench base and is covered with compacted
soil backfill. This anchoring distributes membrane mechanical tension through the embankment
and prevents pull-out during rapid water level variation.

**Pump suction penetration:** Membriko installs EPDM compression flange fittings at all
membrane penetration points. For the submersible pump suction pipe — the most critical
penetration, where a seal failure leads directly to external leakage — the compression flange
creates a mechanical seal independent of adhesive. The EPDM compression ring is tightened
against the pipework and membrane with stainless steel bolts, ensuring a seal that accommodates
thermal expansion of the pipe.

**Overflow penetration:** the emergency overflow (which prevents embankment overtopping failure)
receives the same EPDM compression flange detail as the pump suction. The overflow invert level
defines maximum allowable water level — installed minimum 300 mm below embankment crest.

### Step 6: Filling, Verification and Warranty

Reservoir filling is progressive — never rapid filling that creates pressure shocks against the
membrane and seams before they are fully cured. Membriko supervises the start of filling and
carries out visual inspection of all seams and penetration fittings throughout the process. Any
sign of seam separation or fitting leakage is corrected before proceeding with further filling.

Water level monitoring for the first 72 hours after full filling confirms the absence of abnormal
infiltration. Natural evaporation in the Alentejo summer is 5-8 mm/day — any level drop
exceeding this indicates active infiltration and triggers investigation.

At project completion, Membriko issues the 15-year installation warranty certificate, the quality
inspection report with photographic record, and the EPDM reservoir maintenance guide. Membriko
also provides technical support by telephone in the event of any unusual observation during the
first years of operation.

## Sizing Agricultural Reservoirs for Crop Irrigation

Membriko does not sell membrane — we deliver water storage solutions. An integral part of that
solution is ensuring the reservoir is correctly sized for the farm's irrigation requirement. An
undersized reservoir empties before the end of the irrigation season; an oversized one ties up
capital unnecessarily.

### Key Sizing Variables

**Irrigated area (ha):** the total area served by the reservoir.

**Crop water requirement (ETc, mm/season):** reference evapotranspiration corrected by the crop
coefficient (Kc). Reference values for Portuguese conditions:

| Crop | ETc (mm/season) | Kc range |
|---|---|---|
| Olive | 250-400 | 0.6-0.8 |
| Vine | 350-500 | 0.5-0.9 |
| Citrus | 700-900 | 0.7-0.9 |
| Industrial tomato | 500-700 | 0.7-1.1 |
| Market vegetables | 400-600 | 0.8-1.2 |
| Maize | 500-700 | 0.8-1.2 |

**Effective rainfall during irrigation season (mm):** in the Alentejo, May-September, effective
rainfall is 50-100 mm. In the Algarve, 20-50 mm. In practice, the reservoir must supply virtually
all crop water demand during the irrigation season.

**Irrigation system efficiency:** drip 90-95%; sprinkler 70-85%; surface/furrow 50-65%.

**Simplified sizing formula:**
Volume (m³) = (ETc - Effective rainfall) × Area (m²) / (Efficiency × 1,000)

**Worked example — 10 ha olives in Alentejo with drip irrigation:**
- ETc = 350 mm; Effective rainfall = 75 mm; Net irrigation demand = 275 mm
- Volume = 275 × 100,000 / (0.92 × 1,000) = 29,891 m³ ≈ **30,000 m³**

For a 30,000 m³ reservoir, Membriko designs a basin with approximately 8,000-10,000 m² surface
area and 3.0-3.5 m average depth (with 1:2.5 side slopes). The EPDM membrane area required,
including slopes, is approximately 18,000-22,000 m².

### Safety Factors

Membriko recommends adding to the calculated volume:
- 20-25% for inter-annual precipitation variability (drought year buffer)
- 5-10% for direct evaporation from the water surface
- Minimum 500 mm freeboard between maximum operating level and embankment crest

Membriko carries out complete reservoir sizing as part of the technical proposal, at no
additional cost to the client.

## EPDM vs HDPE vs PVC vs Compacted Clay

Membriko presents this comparison with professional honesty. For reservoirs above approximately
100,000 m³ where the lower cost per m² of HDPE geomembrane makes a material difference to
project economics, HDPE may be the more rational economic choice. For the vast majority of
Portuguese agricultural reservoirs, EPDM is superior on every technical criterion that determines
durability and maintenance simplicity.

| Characteristic | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | Reinforced PVC | Compacted Clay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 25-40 years | 10-20 years | Indefinite (but high seasonal losses) |
| Exposed UV resistance | Intrinsic — no depletion | HALS stabiliser dependent (depletes 25-50 yrs) | Poor — weakens in 10-15 years | N/A |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | ≥ 700% (but low permanent deformation) | 200-300% | N/A |
| Field seaming | Adhesive tape / cold vulcanisation | Thermal fusion (specialist equipment) | Thermal fusion or solvent | N/A |
| Herbicide resistance | Excellent | Good | Moderate | N/A |
| Infiltration in drought | Zero | Zero | Zero | 30-60% (desiccation cracking) |
| Minimum installation temperature | 5°C | 10°C (thermal fusion) | 5°C | 5°C |
| PDR2030 eligibility | Eligible | Eligible | Eligible | Not applicable |

**EPDM vs Compacted Clay:** compacted clay has virtually zero material cost, but Membriko
calculates that in a typical Alentejo farm pond on expansive clay soil, the annual infiltration
loss equals the cost of an EPDM membrane within 3-8 years. Beyond that point, the farmer pays
indefinitely in lost water.

**EPDM vs HDPE:** HDPE has a lower cost per m². For reservoirs below approximately 20,000 m²,
where the number of field seams is limited and EPDM's advantages in flexibility and seaming
ease are fully realised, Membriko recommends EPDM. For retention lagoons exceeding 20 ha,
the comparative evaluation is made case by case — Membriko will recommend whichever system
best serves the specific project.

## UV Resistance in Open-Sky Reservoirs

The freeboard of an agricultural farm pond in the Alentejo — the membrane zone permanently
exposed above the waterline — receives more solar radiation per unit area than any part of a
building roof. The Alentejo and Algarve have 2,800-3,000 sunshine hours per year and global
horizontal irradiance (GHI) of 1,800-2,000 kWh/m²/year, among the highest in continental
Europe.

EPDM's UV resistance is intrinsic and does not depend on additives that deplete over time:

**Resistance mechanism:** the primary polymer chain of EPDM has no C=C double bonds.
Photodegradation of polymers occurs by UV-B radiation (290-315 nm) breaking double bonds via
photo-oxidation and ozonolysis. Without double bonds in the main chain, EPDM has no reactive
sites for this degradation mechanism.

**The role of carbon black:** Membriko's EPDM membranes contain 30-50 phr of carbon black
as reinforcing filler and UV absorber. Carbon black absorbs UV radiation and converts it to
heat by internal conversion — it is not consumed in this process. Its effectiveness as a UV
absorber is permanent, unlike HDPE's HALS stabilisers which are progressively consumed in
performing their protective function.

**Test data:** EN ISO 4892-3 accelerated weathering (xenon arc, 2,000 hours, equivalent to
approximately 20-30 years of Portuguese outdoor exposure):
- No cracking or checking
- Tensile strength retention > 90%
- Colour Delta-E < 3

The exposed freeboard of a Membriko EPDM farm pond performs as well after 25 years of service
as it did on the first day. This is a verifiable claim backed by more than 50 years of field
service data from EPDM installations in comparable Mediterranean climatic conditions.

## Reservoir Maintenance

One of the most practically significant advantages of a Membriko EPDM farm reservoir is the
near-absence of membrane-specific maintenance. Unlike compacted clay (requiring annual repairs
to cracked zones), concrete (requiring crack treatment and surface coatings), or PVC
(stiffening and tearing), EPDM has no active maintenance requirements over decades of service.

### Annual Inspection Checklist

Membriko recommends an annual visual inspection at the start of the filling season
(October-November). This inspection should verify:

- **Anchor trench zone:** confirm the backfill over the anchor trench has not settled or
  eroded; confirm the membrane is not exposed or under abnormal tension; check for any
  erosion of the embankment crest in the anchor zone
- **Freeboard and above-waterline zone:** the zone of highest UV exposure and greatest
  water level variation; inspect visually for any mechanical abrasion, cuts or abnormal
  membrane folds
- **Penetration fittings — compression flanges:** check that pump suction and overflow
  flanges show no sign of weeping (trace moisture on the outer face of the adjacent
  embankment); tighten compression bolts if required
- **Livestock watering point:** in reservoirs with cattle or sheep access, check
  membrane integrity at the trampling zone; if stone or concrete apron protection is
  absent and trampling is intensive, Membriko can install a heavier-gauge EPDM strip
  (1.5 mm) at the animal access point as a reinforcement

### Repairing Mechanical Damage

If the membrane sustains localised mechanical damage — a puncture from a tool, a growing
root, or a submerged sharp debris fragment — repair is straightforward and permanent:

- **Above the waterline:** clean and dry the affected zone; light abrasion of the membrane
  surface for mechanical keying; apply EPDM patch of the same thickness using QuickSeam
  primer and QuickSeam tape; 24-hour cure before immersion; repair time 2-4 hours per
  localised damage point
- **Below the waterline:** requires partial drawdown of the reservoir in the affected zone
  for dry repair; in emergency, Membriko can carry out a temporary underwater repair using
  immersion-curing adhesive, permitting the drawdown to be deferred to a convenient time

### What to Avoid

- Machinery (excavators, tractors) operating within 2 metres of the inner slope edge — puncture
  risk is significant even with the geotextile protection layer in place
- Sharp agricultural tools (pitch forks, spade tips) near the membrane
- Rapid filling with very high flow rates creating turbulence and mechanical impact on the
  membrane before it is fully cured and anchored
- Open burning of vegetation near the reservoir margin — flame temperature can cause localised
  damage to the exposed membrane

## Portuguese Agricultural Subsidies — PDR2030 and PRR

### PDR2030 — Rural Development Programme

PDR2030 is Portugal's rural development programme for 2021-2030, within the EU Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) framework. It allocates approximately €3.9 billion to Portuguese
rural development, with a significant share directed at water efficiency and irrigation
infrastructure.

**Operação 4.1 — Investments in Agricultural Holdings:**
This is the most accessible funding route for individual farmers constructing or rehabilitating
an agricultural reservoir. Eligible costs include:
- Earthworks (excavation, compaction, embankment)
- Waterproofing membrane (EPDM, geotextile, fittings)
- Pumping and water level control equipment
- Irrigation distribution networks

The base support rate is 40% of eligible costs, which may reach 60-65% for:
- Young farmers (under 40 years)
- Convergence regions (Alentejo, interior Algarve)
- Collective projects (cooperatives, farmer associations)
- Investments with documented environmental benefit

**Application procedure:** submission to IFAP (Instituto de Financiamento da Agricultura e
Pescas) with technical project, detailed cost breakdown and farm documentation. Projects below
€50,000 have a simplified application procedure.

**Operação 4.3 — Hydroagricultural Infrastructure:**
For collective reservoirs serving multiple farmers, managed by irrigators' associations or
agricultural cooperatives. Operação 4.3 supports larger-scale investments with potentially
higher support rates.

### PRR — Recovery and Resilience Plan

The PRR is Portugal's national recovery plan funded by EU NextGenerationEU. The "Eficiência
Hídrica" (Water Efficiency) component funds:
- Construction of collective water storage reservoirs
- Irrigation system digitalisation (sensors, automation)
- Conversion from sprinkler to drip irrigation

The PRR is primarily accessible to agricultural cooperatives, irrigators' associations and
municipalities for collective systems. For individual farmers, PDR2030 Operação 4.1 is the
principal mechanism.

### Membriko's Role in Subsidy Applications

Membriko prepares all technical documentation required for PDR2030 and PRR applications:
EPDM membrane technical datasheets, project drawings with membrane layout and cut plan,
detailed cost breakdowns in IFAP's required format, and technical declarations on the
waterproofing system. This documentation is provided at no additional cost to all clients
who commission membrane installation from Membriko.

## APA Water Regulations for Agricultural Reservoirs

### Water Abstraction Licensing

Agricultural reservoirs in Portugal are subject to the Lei da Água (Law 58/2005) framework and
the Water Resources Use Regulation (Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007). The competent authority is APA —
Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente, acting through regional hydrographic administrations (ARH):
ARH Tejo e Oeste, ARH Alentejo, ARH Algarve, ARH Norte and ARH Centro.

**Surface water abstraction licence:** reservoirs fed by stream diversion or catchment run-off
collection typically require an abstraction licence from the relevant ARH when the captured
volume exceeds defined thresholds (generally above 5,000 m³/year for irrigation use). For
smaller volumes, a prior declaration may suffice.

**Groundwater abstraction licence:** borehole-fed reservoirs require a separate groundwater
abstraction licence from APA. The borehole itself must also be declared and licensed with APA.

**Class D dam classification:** açudes and reservoirs with total volume above approximately
100,000 m³ or dam height above 5 m are classified as Class D dams under Decreto-Lei 21/2018
(Dam Safety Regulations) and require a safety project and periodic inspection. The vast majority
of Portuguese agricultural farm ponds fall below these thresholds.

### National Ecological Reserve and Environmental Restrictions

Construction of agricultural reservoirs in areas classified as Reserva Ecológica Nacional
(REN) — which includes watercourse protection zones, floodplains and aquifer infiltration
areas — requires derogation from the regional CCDR (Comissão de Coordenação e Desenvolvimento
Regional). The use of inert EPDM membrane rather than materials with chemical migration
potential (such as plasticised PVC) is a supportive argument in the environmental impact
assessment for reservoirs near protected wetland areas or Natura 2000 sites.

Membriko collaborates with the client's environmental consultant in preparing the technical
documentation on the membrane waterproofing system for EIA or REN processes as required.

## Integration with Drip Irrigation Systems

Drip irrigation is the system that best valorises water stored in a lined reservoir. With field
efficiency of 90-95% (against 50-65% for gravity/surface systems), drip maximises the benefit
of every cubic metre of water preserved by the EPDM membrane.

### Full Compatibility with All Irrigation Systems

Membriko designs membrane penetrations to integrate with the client's existing or planned
irrigation system:

**Submersible pump suction fitting:** the EPDM compression flange is compatible with
polyethylene (PE) or PVC pipework of any commercial diameter (typically DN50 to DN200 for
agricultural pump installations). Membriko coordinates with the pump supplier to ensure
the penetration diameter is correct for the specified pump.

**Overflow fitting:** installed at maximum operating level (300-500 mm below embankment
crest), the overflow designed by Membriko is sized for the maximum flood inflow from the
catchment, calculated from catchment area and design rainfall (typically 10-25 year return
period for small agricultural ponds).

**Fertigation compatibility:** EPDM is inert to all soluble fertilisers used in drip
fertigation — including concentrated solutions of calcium nitrate, potassium nitrate,
monoammonium phosphate and chelated micronutrients. There is no chemical compatibility
concern between standard fertigation solutions and the EPDM membrane.

**Level sensor and automation:** Membriko installs a small-diameter penetration sleeve
(DN20-DN32) for the level sensor cable integrated with automatic irrigation controllers.
The penetration uses the same EPDM compression flange detail as the larger pipe penetrations.

### Return on Investment

A 5,000 m² Membriko EPDM farm pond combined with drip irrigation on 10 ha of olives in
the Alentejo:

- **Water saving by eliminating infiltration losses:** 4,500-6,000 m³/year
- **Water saving from drip vs sprinkler (30% reduction):** 30% × 30,000 m³ = 9,000 m³/year
- **Total annual water saving:** 13,500-15,000 m³/year
- **Value of water saved (at €0.10/m³):** €1,350-1,500/year
- **EPDM membrane cost (5,000 m² farm pond):** approximately €18,000-25,000
- **Simple payback period:** 12-18 years (without subsidy); 6-10 years with 40% PDR2030 support

This calculation does not include the value of production secured by the preserved water.
In drought years when available water is the limiting factor, the ROI of the EPDM membrane
includes the value of the harvest that would otherwise be lost to water stress.

## Frequently Asked Questions — Agricultural EPDM Reservoirs

**Is irrigation water stored in an EPDM farm pond safe for food crops, including certified
organic production?**

Yes. Membriko installs only EPDM formulated without plasticisers, biocides, heavy metals or
compounds that migrate into water. EPDM is chemically inert in contact with water at any
temperature and pH within the agricultural range. It is used worldwide in reservoirs serving
organic viticulture, certified horticulture and organic fruit production. The water quality
depends on the source water and the catchment, not on the EPDM membrane.

**What is the maximum reservoir size that Membriko can waterproof with EPDM?**

There is no practical size limit. Membriko has technical capability for projects from small
irrigation tanks of 20 m³ to agricultural retention lagoons with hundreds of thousands of
cubic metres of storage. For reservoirs with membrane areas above 10,000 m², Membriko
coordinates factory pre-vulcanisation of large EPDM panels, minimising field seams to panel
junction connections only. EPDM-lined reservoirs of several hectares are installed worldwide —
the technology has no scale limitation.

**Does EPDM membrane resist cattle and sheep trampling at the reservoir watering point?**

EPDM resists livestock trampling at the reservoir water's edge. In zones of intensive daily
animal access, Membriko recommends a stone rubble or sprayed concrete apron extending 0.5-1.0 m
below normal water level at the animal access point, protecting the membrane from concentrated
hoof impact. The reservoir base membrane — permanently submerged — is unaffected by livestock
presence. Membriko can specify the edge protection detail as part of the project scope.

**Can the reservoir waterproofing be included in a PDR2030 application?**

Yes. EPDM membrane and installation works are eligible costs under PDR2030 Operação 4.1
(Investimentos nas Explorações Agrícolas) for water efficiency investment projects. The base
support rate is 40%, potentially reaching 65% in specific circumstances. Membriko prepares all
technical documentation required for IFAP applications — technical datasheets, project drawings
and detailed cost breakdowns — at no additional charge to clients who commission the membrane
installation.

**How long does installation take on a 2,000 m² farm pond?**

A 2,000 m² farm pond (surface area; with 1:2.5 slopes, membrane area approximately
3,000-3,500 m²) takes 2-3 days for geotextile and EPDM membrane installation with a two-person
Membriko specialist team, assuming earthworks and soil preparation are complete. Total project
time from completion of earthworks to reservoir in service is typically 4-6 days, including
filling and the 72-hour level monitoring verification period.

**Does the EPDM membrane withstand a fully empty and sun-exposed reservoir during summer?**

Yes. This is one of EPDM's critical advantages over bentonite geocomposites (GCL). EPDM
maintains all physical and chemical properties under conditions of total desiccation and
direct solar radiation. The permanently exposed freeboard of an EPDM-lined farm pond
performs as well as the submerged zone over 50+ years of service. When the reservoir
refills after a dry summer, the membrane immediately resumes its full waterproofing
performance without any rehydration or conditioning process. This is not true of bentonite
geocomposites, which can desiccate and crack irreversibly when drained without overburden.

**What warranty does Membriko provide for agricultural reservoirs?**

Membriko issues a 15-year installation warranty on all agricultural reservoir waterproofing
work with EPDM membrane. This warranty covers watertightness failures attributable to the
membrane or the installation — it does not cover mechanical damage from identifiable external
causes (machinery, tools, unprotected livestock trampling). The warranty certificate is
delivered to the client at project completion, together with the photographic inspection
record and the reservoir maintenance guide.

**What is the practical difference between EPDM and HDPE for a farm reservoir?**

HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) is a valid geomembrane for large-scale reservoirs. For the
majority of Portuguese agricultural reservoirs (up to 20,000-30,000 m² of surface area), EPDM
offers clear technical advantages: simpler field seaming (cold vulcanisation tape versus thermal
fusion), intrinsic UV resistance without HALS stabilisers that deplete over time, and greater
flexibility in accommodating expansive or differentially settling soils. For retention lagoons
above 20 hectares, Membriko evaluates both options on a case-by-case basis and recommends
whichever system best serves the specific project's technical and economic requirements.
