# Farm Reservoirs — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The farm reservoirs page targets a very specific Portuguese agricultural audience that is
making a capital infrastructure decision, not a commodity purchase. The farmer or herdade
manager reading this page has a concrete problem: they are losing water through an unsealed
reservoir, or they are building a new charca and need to understand why EPDM outperforms
the alternatives. They may also be preparing a PDR2030 subsidy application that requires
technical specifications.

The persuasion architecture follows three arcs simultaneously:

1. **The water scarcity arc:** open with the Portuguese agricultural water crisis as the
   framing — this gives the technical product decision a larger economic and environmental
   context that resonates with any farmer in the Alentejo or Algarve who has watched their
   wells drop or their stream flows decline.

2. **The technical superiority arc:** deliver the specific EPDM advantages over HDPE, PVC and
   clay in reservoir applications. This audience is technically literate and commercially
   hard-headed — they will not be persuaded by vague durability claims. Data, specifics, and
   honest acknowledgement of trade-offs build the necessary credibility.

3. **The financial and regulatory arc:** subsidies (PDR2030, PRR) and APA licensing are
   everyday concerns for Portuguese farmers. A page that addresses these directly, with
   accurate information, is immediately more useful than competitor pages that ignore them.
   This section positions Membriko as a knowledgeable partner, not just a membrane supplier.

The page must work for two distinct reader types:
- **Small and medium farmers** with charcas of 500-5,000 m², likely in Alentejo or Algarve,
  potentially applying for PDR2030 support for a new or rehabilitated reservoir
- **Large agricultural enterprises** (herdades, quintas producing wine, olive oil, citrus)
  with lagoas of 10,000-500,000 m³, requiring detailed technical specifications for a
  project-managed installation

Both audiences need to leave the page with confidence that Membriko understands their
application and can deliver it correctly.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Agriculture and the Water Crisis

**Purpose:** Establish the high-stakes context for every decision about farm reservoir
waterproofing. Connect the product to the lived reality of farming in water-stressed Portugal.

**Content:**
- Open with the structural water deficit in southern Portugal: Alentejo and Algarve receive
  400-600 mm of rain per year, almost exclusively in winter; by July, rivers are dry and
  aquifers are in drawdown
- Agriculture accounts for 74% of Portuguese freshwater consumption; the extension of
  irrigated olive groves, vineyards and vegetable production into the Alentejo interior is
  deepening pressure on water resources
- Farm reservoirs — charcas, açudes, tanques, lagoas — are the structural response: they
  capture winter rainfall and hold it for summer irrigation
- The problem: without adequate waterproofing, 20-60% of stored volume is lost through
  infiltration before it reaches the crop
- The Membriko answer: EPDM membrane waterproofing eliminates infiltration losses and
  protects the reservoir investment for 50+ years
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / Zero infiltration losses / 400% elongation / 15-year
  Membriko warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Proposta Técnica"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Farm Reservoirs

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — make the specific case for EPDM over competing
materials in the agricultural reservoir environment.

**Content:**
- The four stresses every reservoir waterproofing system must withstand:
  1. UV exposure on the exposed freeboard and upper slopes (years of open-sky exposure in
     Portuguese summer conditions)
  2. Chemical exposure: agricultural water contains dissolved fertilisers, herbicide residues,
     organic matter; EPDM is inert to all at agriculturally relevant concentrations
  3. Mechanical stress: soil settlement, livestock trampling, seasonal shrink/swell in clay
     soils; EPDM's 400% elongation accommodates movement without tearing
  4. Temperature cycling: from 0°C in winter (frost in inland areas) to +50°C on exposed
     dark membrane in summer; EPDM's service range of -45°C to +130°C covers this completely
- The chemistry argument: EPDM has no plasticisers (unlike PVC), no UV-stabiliser depletion
  mechanism (unlike HDPE), no cracking from desiccation (unlike compacted clay)
- Key properties table:
  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness (charcas) | 1.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Thickness (tanques/lagoas) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | UV resistance | No degradation at 2,000 hrs | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
  | Fertiliser resistance | Excellent — inert to NPK | ASTM D471 |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Section 3: Reservoir Types — Charcas, Tanques, Açudes, Lagoas

**Purpose:** Establish that Membriko's EPDM solution covers every scale and type of
agricultural water storage, not just a single niche.

**Content:** Four reservoir type cards.

**Charcas (Farm Ponds):**
- Context: the traditional Portuguese farm pond; earthen basin, 200-5,000 m² surface area;
  most common type in Alentejo and Algarve; historically relied on natural clay that cracks
  in summer droughts
- EPDM solution: 1.0 mm membrane over 200 g/m² geotextile, installed on prepared earthen
  bed and slopes; anchor trench at embankment crest
- Sizing note: typical charca for 10 ha of olives in Alentejo = approximately 30,000 m³
  storage volume

**Tanques de Rega (Irrigation Tanks):**
- Context: constructed concrete or masonry tanks, 10-2,000 m³; typically above-grade or
  semi-buried; used for short-term storage adjacent to irrigation distribution point;
  concrete cracks as tank ages
- EPDM solution: 1.5 mm membrane bonded to interior concrete surface; appropriate for
  rehabilitation of leaking tanks without demolition; full impermeability restoration

**Açudes (Check Dams):**
- Context: small dams across seasonal watercourses; thousands in Alentejo, many historical
  stone masonry structures now deteriorating; upstream face and base lose watertightness
  as masonry joints erode
- EPDM solution: 1.5 mm membrane on upstream face and reservoir base; anchored at dam crest;
  mechanical penetration details for outlet pipe and overflow structure

**Lagoas de Retenção Agrícola (Agricultural Retention Lagoons):**
- Context: large-scale storage for commercial agriculture; 10,000-500,000 m³; typically
  serving tomato, pepper, maize or mixed vegetable production on Alentejo latifúndios
- EPDM solution: factory-vulcanised panel seams for large single-piece installations;
  mechanical crest anchoring; integration with pump stations and outlet structures

## Section 4: Water Conservation in Alentejo and Algarve

**Purpose:** Deepen the connection between EPDM membrane waterproofing and the specific
water conservation imperative in Portugal's most water-stressed regions.

**Content:**
- Alentejo: 33,000 km² of territory with 400-550 mm mean annual precipitation; home to
  Portugal's most intensive irrigated agriculture (tomato, corn, olives, wine); groundwater
  levels in the Bacia do Sado and Bacia do Guadiana have been declining for three consecutive
  decades; farm reservoirs are the primary resilience mechanism
- Algarve: Portugal's most water-stressed region; 400-500 mm annual precipitation; 85% of
  water demand is for citrus and horticulture; the Algarve's aquifers are under severe
  pressure from agriculture and tourism; farm reservoirs and rainwater harvesting are
  mandated in the regional water management plan
- Climate projections (IPMA/EU): Portuguese climate models project a 10-20% reduction in
  mean annual precipitation by 2050 for southern Portugal, and a 30-40% increase in
  drought frequency; the economic case for properly waterproofed farm reservoirs will
  strengthen with each passing decade
- Quantification: a 5,000 m² charca at 3 m depth stores 15,000 m³; in an unlined clay charca
  with 30% annual infiltration loss, that is 4,500 m³ lost to the soil each year; at €0.10/m³
  (typical Portuguese water tariff for agricultural use), this is €450/year — the EPDM membrane
  pays for itself in avoided water losses within 3-5 years on a medium-sized operation

---

## Section 5: Installation Process (6 Steps)

**Purpose:** Make the installation process concrete, predictable, and professionally credible.
Farmers want to know what happens, in what order, and what the risks are.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Levantamento Técnico do Reservatório** — Topographic survey of the reservoir basin;
   soil investigation (type, bearing capacity, stability of side slopes); hydraulic
   calculations to confirm storage volume; preliminary membrane dimensioning and layout plan;
   identification of all penetrations required (pump intake, overflow, inlet, level sensor)

2. **Preparação do Solo e do Leito** — Earthworks: excavation to design profile; compaction
   of base and slopes (minimum Proctor density 95%); removal of all stones, roots and sharp
   objects from the membrane zone; verification of slope gradient stability; survey to
   confirm final reservoir volume

3. **Instalação do Geotêxtil de Protecção** — Installation of 200 g/m² non-woven geotextile
   over entire base and slopes; geotextile provides cushioning protection between soil surface
   and EPDM membrane, preventing puncture from sub-surface stones and root protrusions;
   geotextile overlaps at seams minimum 500 mm; secured at crest with temporary anchors before
   EPDM installation

4. **Instalação da Membrana EPDM** — Membrane panels positioned beginning at reservoir base,
   unrolled up side slopes; seams bonded with QuickSeam tape (150 mm width) and QuickPrime
   Plus primer; cold vulcanisation seaming is weather-independent above 5°C ambient;
   membrane panels sized to minimise seam count; large reservoirs use factory-vulcanised
   panels with in-field connection seams only at the junctions

5. **Ancoragem no Bordo Superior e Pontos Singulares** — Perimeter anchor trench excavated
   at embankment crest: membrane folds 300 mm into the trench and is covered with compacted
   soil backfill; EPDM compression flange fittings installed at all penetration points (pump
   suction, overflow, inlet pipe, level sensor cable); no adhesive-only penetration details
   — all fittings use mechanical compression to create the primary seal

6. **Enchimento, Verificação e Garantia** — Progressive filling of reservoir over 24-48 hours;
   inspection of all seams and penetration fittings during filling; water level monitoring
   over 72 hours to confirm absence of infiltration; photographic as-built documentation;
   issue of 15-year Membriko installation warranty

## Section 6: Sizing for Crop Irrigation

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko understands the agricultural application, not just
the membrane product. Sizing guidance adds genuine value to the farmer's decision process.

**Content:**
- The key sizing variables: irrigated area (ha), crop water requirement (ETc in mm/season),
  effective rainfall during irrigation season, irrigation system efficiency, and required
  storage duration (weeks of full crop demand)
- Reference ETc values for major Portuguese irrigated crops:
  - Olive: 250-400 mm/season; citrus: 700-900 mm/season; vines: 350-500 mm/season;
    industrial tomato: 500-700 mm/season; vegetables: 400-600 mm/season
- Worked example: 10 ha olives, Alentejo, drip irrigation → approximately 30,000 m³
  required storage
- Rule of thumb: for Alentejo olives with drip irrigation, approximately 2,500-3,500 m³
  per hectare of irrigated area; for Algarve citrus, 6,000-9,000 m³ per hectare
- Safety factor: recommend 20-25% additional volume for inter-annual precipitation
  variability (drought year buffer)
- Membrane area calculation from reservoir volume: simple worked example showing how
  reservoir dimensions (surface area, depth, side slopes) translate into membrane area
  and therefore budget estimation
- CTA: "A Membriko realiza o dimensionamento completo como parte da proposta técnica"

## Section 7: EPDM vs HDPE vs PVC vs Argila

**Purpose:** Objective comparison with the main competing systems. Agricultural buyers
compare systems and this comparison must be thorough enough to end the research process.

**Content:** Comparison table and explanatory paragraphs.

| Característica | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrana | PVC Reforçado | Argila Compactada |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vida útil | 50+ anos | 25-40 anos (depende UV stabiliser) | 10-20 anos | Indefinida mas com perdas sazonais |
| Elongação na rutura | ≥ 400% | 700%+ (mas deformação permanente baixa) | 200-300% | N/A |
| Resistência UV exposta | Intrínseca — sem depleção | Depende de HALS (depleta 25-50 anos) | Fraca — enfraquece em 10-15 anos | N/A |
| Emendas em obra | Fita adesiva / vulcanização fria | Solda térmica (equipamento especializado) | Solda térmica ou solvente | N/A |
| Resistência a herbicidas | Excelente | Boa | Moderada | N/A |
| Infiltração em seca | Zero | Zero | Zero | 30-60% (fissuras de dessecação) |
| Custo relativo (por m²) | Médio-alto | Médio | Baixo-médio | Muito baixo (mas perdas elevadas) |

Honest paragraph: HDPE is a legitimate alternative for very large reservoirs (100,000 m³+)
where the lower cost per m² makes a material difference to project economics. For reservoirs
below 20,000-30,000 m³ (the majority of Portuguese farm reservoirs), EPDM's easier seaming,
intrinsic UV stability, and superior flexibility in accommodating soil movement make it the
technically superior choice.

## Section 8: UV Resistance in Exposed Reservoirs

**Purpose:** Address the specific concern about membrane longevity in a fully exposed outdoor
reservoir environment — the Alentejo summer UV is among the most intense in continental Europe.

**Content:**
- Portuguese solar irradiance data: Alentejo and Algarve receive 2,800-3,000 hours of sunshine
  per year; GHI of 1,800-2,000 kWh/m²/year; among the highest in continental Europe
- The exposed membrane zone: the freeboard (the membrane above the water surface) and the
  crest anchoring zone receive direct solar radiation year-round, without the UV attenuation
  of water depth
- Why this matters: most membrane materials require UV protection additives that deplete;
  EPDM does not — its UV resistance is chemical, not additive-dependent
- Technical explanation: the saturated polymer backbone (no C=C double bonds in main chain)
  is not subject to photochemical chain scission; carbon black loading (30-50 phr) converts
  UV to heat without being consumed in the process
- Performance data: 2,000 hours xenon arc testing (EN ISO 4892-3) — no cracking, no loss
  of tensile strength, colour Delta-E < 3; equivalent to 20-30 years Portuguese outdoor exposure
- Comparison: HDPE geomembrane HALS UV stabiliser estimated depletion at year 25-35 depending
  on UV dose; PVC stabilisers depleted within 10-15 years; EPDM carbon black effective
  indefinitely (>50 years documented field service in equivalent UV conditions)

## Section 9: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Full technical data table for engineers, agricultural consultants, and
PDR2030 application documentation.

**Content:** Complete data table.

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (charcas / ponds) | 1.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (tanques / reservoirs) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 20 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |
| Hydrostatic watertightness | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 (Method B) |
| UV resistance | No cracking at 2,000 hrs | EN ISO 4892-3 |

| Available widths | Up to 15.25 m | — |
| Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |
| CE Marking | Yes | EN 13956 |

---

## Section 10: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Reassure buyers that EPDM farm reservoirs require very little maintenance —
a key selling point for farmers who cannot spend time on infrastructure.

**Content:**
- Annual maintenance requirements: effectively none beyond visual inspection
- Annual inspection checklist: inspect anchor trench zone for displacement or erosion; inspect
  penetration fittings for signs of movement or seepage; check freeboard zone for any
  mechanical damage from floating debris or livestock; confirm overflow is clear
- What livestock access means: cattle and sheep can drink safely from EPDM-lined reservoirs;
  the upper bank zone where animals stand should ideally be protected with a stone or concrete
  apron extending 0.5-1.0 m below the normal water level to protect the membrane from hoof
  impact; the submerged membrane base is not affected by livestock
- Repair procedure: EPDM repair patches can be applied to the dry membrane above the
  waterline with QuickSeam primer and patch; underwater repair is possible in emergencies
  with specialised adhesive; permanent below-water-line repair requires partial reservoir
  drawdown
- What to avoid: sharp agricultural tools near the membrane; heavy machinery (tractors,
  excavators) operating within 2 m of the membrane crest; direct application of concentrated
  chemical products (herbicides, fertilisers) to the dry exposed membrane

## Section 11: Portuguese Agricultural Subsidies (PDR2030, PRR)

**Purpose:** Directly address the subsidy question — the majority of farm reservoir projects
in Portugal are part-funded by EU agricultural support programmes, and the technical
specification requirements of these programmes influence material choice.

**Content:**
- PDR2030 Operação 4.1: investment support for individual farms; eligible costs include
  reservoir earthworks and membrane waterproofing; support rate 40% base (up to 65% for
  young farmers and disadvantaged regions); applications via IFAP
- PDR2030 Operação 4.3: collective irrigation infrastructure; accessible for agricultural
  cooperatives and irrigation associations (associações de regantes)
- PRR component "Eficiência Hídrica": specific funding stream for water storage and
  efficiency; complements PDR2030 for certain project types
- Technical documentation required for IFAP applications: membrane technical datasheet,
  project drawings with reservoir dimensions and membrane area, specifications of
  waterproofing system including geotextile and anchoring details
- Membriko's role: "A Membriko prepara toda a documentação técnica necessária para a
  candidatura PDR2030, incluindo fichas técnicas, especificações de projeto e orçamentação
  detalhada no formato exigido pelo IFAP"

---

## Section 12: APA Water Regulations

**Purpose:** Address the regulatory framework for water abstraction and reservoir construction
so that farmers understand the licensing landscape before committing to a project.

**Content:**
- Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005): establishes the national water resources framework; all
  abstraction of surface and groundwater requires a licence from APA/ARH
- Licença de captação de água superficial: required for reservoirs fed by stream diversion
  or run-off; threshold approximately 5,000 m³/year for irrigation use; application to
  ARH of the relevant hydrographic basin (ARH Tejo, ARH Alentejo, ARH Algarve, etc.)
- Licença de captação de água subterrânea: required for borehole-fed reservoirs; borehole
  must also be declared to APA
- Barragem de classe D (small dams, Decreto-Lei 21/2018): reservoirs above approximately
  100,000 m³ or with dam height > 5 m may require dam safety classification and periodic
  inspection; smaller reservoirs are exempt
- Environmental restrictions: reservoirs in or adjacent to REN (Reserva Ecológica Nacional)
  zones require CCDR derogation; EPDM's inert chemistry is an advantage in environmental
  impact assessments near protected wetland or Natura 2000 areas
- Note: APA does not prescribe specific membrane materials for farm reservoirs; EPDM choice
  is driven by technical and economic arguments, not regulatory mandate

---

## Section 13: Integration with Drip Irrigation

**Purpose:** Show Membriko's understanding of the complete water management system —
the reservoir is not an end in itself but the first stage in an irrigation chain.

**Content:**
- Why drip irrigation is the correct partner for a lined reservoir: 90-95% field efficiency
  vs 50-65% for surface/furrow irrigation; drip delivers water at the root zone, minimising
  evaporation; in Alentejo conditions, drip can reduce total water application by 30-50%
  compared to sprinkler irrigation for olives
- Penetration details for drip system integration:
  - Pump suction fitting: EPDM compression flange at base of reservoir slope; compatible
    with submersible pumps of any capacity
  - Overflow/spill fitting: EPDM sleeve at freeboard level; prevents reservoir overfilling
    and protects embankment from erosion
  - Filtration bypass inlet: penetration for back-flush return water from drip system filter
  - Level sensor cable: EPDM cable penetration sleeve for electronic level monitoring
    integrated with irrigation automation controllers
- Integration with fertigation: EPDM is inert to soluble fertiliser concentrates injected
  at the reservoir pump station; no chemical compatibility concern with standard drip
  fertigation products
- Return on investment: a 5,000 m² EPDM-lined charca combined with drip irrigation for
  10 ha of olives eliminates approximately 4,500 m³/year of infiltration loss and reduces
  water application by 30% vs sprinkler — total annual water saving of 7,000-9,000 m³/year;
  at €0.10/m³ agricultural water cost, ROI on the EPDM membrane in 4-6 years

## Section 14: FAQs (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail agricultural search intent and pre-empt the most common
technical and commercial questions in this application.

1. **A água de rega armazenada numa charca EPDM é segura para culturas alimentares, incluindo
   em modo biológico?**
   Yes. EPDM is chemically inert — it releases no plasticisers, heavy metals, biocides or
   organic compounds into water. It is used globally to line reservoirs serving organic
   fruit, vegetable and wine production. The water quality depends on the source water and
   the catchment, not on the EPDM membrane.

2. **Qual a dimensão máxima de reservatório que a Membriko pode impermeabilizar com EPDM?**
   There is no practical size limit. Membriko has technical capability for reservoirs from
   small farm tanks of 20 m³ to agricultural lagoons exceeding 100,000 m³. For very large
   reservoirs, factory-vulcanised EPDM panels of several thousand m² are pre-fabricated and
   connected on site with field seams only at panel junctions.

3. **A membrana EPDM resiste ao pisoteio de bovinos e ovinos que bebem no reservatório?**
   EPDM resists livestock trampling at the reservoir water's edge. In zones of intensive
   animal passage (daily watering points), Membriko recommends a stone or concrete apron
   extending 0.5-1.0 m below normal water level at the animal access point to protect
   the membrane from concentrated hoof impact. The base membrane is unaffected by livestock.

4. **Posso usar água de charca EPDM num sistema de gotejamento com fertirrigação?**
   Yes. EPDM is inert to soluble fertilisers at any concentration used in drip fertigation.
   The membrane penetration fittings (pump suction, overflow) are standard EPDM compression
   flanges compatible with pump stations of any capacity. Membriko designs the penetration
   layout to integrate with the existing or planned irrigation system.

5. **A candidatura PDR2030 cobre a membrana EPDM como custo elegível?**
   Yes. Under PDR2030 Operação 4.1 (Investimentos nas Explorações Agrícolas), reservoir
   waterproofing membrane is an eligible cost within the broader investment in water
   efficiency infrastructure. Membriko prepares the technical documentation required
   for IFAP applications, including technical datasheets, project drawings and detailed
   cost breakdowns in the required format.

6. **Quanto tempo dura a instalação numa charca de 2.000 m²?**
   A 2,000 m² charca (surface area; with slopes, membrane area approximately 3,000-3,500 m²)
   takes 2-3 days for geotextile installation and EPDM membrane installation with a
   two-person specialist team, assuming the earthworks and soil preparation are complete.
   Total project time from earthwork completion to reservoir in service is typically 4-6 days.

7. **A membrana EPDM aguenta a seca completa do reservatório no verão — exposição total ao sol?**
   Yes. EPDM maintains its properties in both wet and dry conditions, including full desiccation
   and direct solar exposure. This is a critical advantage over bentonite geocomposites (GCL)
   which can crack when reservoir is emptied and over compacted clay which cracks severely
   when the reservoir draws down below the clay surface. The freeboard zone of an EPDM-lined
   reservoir — permanently exposed above the water line — performs as well as the submerged
   zone over 50+ years of service.

8. **Qual é a garantia da Membriko para reservatórios agrícolas?**
   Membriko provides a 15-year installation warranty on all agricultural reservoir waterproofing
   work. This is complementary to the membrane manufacturer's product warranty and to the
   statutory defects liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code. The warranty certificate
   is issued at project completion with the as-built documentation and maintenance guide.
