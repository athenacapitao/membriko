# Farm Reservoirs (Reservatórios Agrícolas) — EPDM Research Summary

## Portuguese Agricultural Water Crisis: Context and Scale

Portugal faces a structural water deficit that is deepening with each decade of climate change.
The country's mean annual precipitation is approximately 900 mm — but distributed with extreme
spatial and temporal inequality. The Alentejo and Algarve, which together account for more than
half of Portugal's agricultural land, receive 400-600 mm per year, almost exclusively between
October and April. By May, the rivers are falling. By July, many are dry.

Agriculture accounts for approximately 74% of total freshwater consumption in Portugal, making
it by far the dominant sector of water demand. The national irrigated area exceeds 630,000
hectares, with wine, olive oil, citrus, tomato, and cork oak dominating the irrigated crop mix.
The extension of irrigation into previously rain-fed areas — accelerated by rising export demand
for Portuguese wine and olive oil — has increased pressure on already-stressed aquifers and
surface water bodies.

Farm reservoirs (charcas, açudes, barragens de rega, tanques de armazenamento) are a structural
response to this deficit. By capturing winter rainfall and storing it for summer irrigation, they
decouple crop water demand from the erratic supply of natural watercourses. The Portuguese
government has formally recognised this through PDR2030 (Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural) and
PRR (Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência), which together allocate hundreds of millions of euros
to irrigation infrastructure, including small and medium farm reservoirs.

## Types of Agricultural Reservoirs in Portugal

### Charcas (Farm Ponds)

The charca is the traditional Portuguese farm pond: an earthen basin, typically 500-5,000 m²
in surface area, formed by excavation and/or low earthen embankment. Charcas collect rainwater
run-off, spring water, and small watercourse diversions. Historically, most charcas relied on
natural clay soils for impermeability — a strategy that fails whenever the soil cracks during
the summer dry period. Modern charcas are lined with synthetic membranes, of which EPDM is the
technically superior option.

Key charca parameters relevant to waterproofing:
- Surface area: typically 200-5,000 m²; large farm ponds can exceed 1 hectare
- Depth: typically 2-5 m at deepest point; average water depth 1.5-3 m
- Side slopes (taludes): typically 1:2 to 1:3 (vertical:horizontal) in stable soils;
  flatter in expansive or unstable soils
- Soil type: predominantly clay-loam in Alentejo; schist and granite-derived soils in northern
  interior; sandy-clay in coastal areas
- Water source: winter rainfall run-off; stream diversion; borehole pumping

### Tanques de Rega (Irrigation Tanks)

Tanques de rega are constructed concrete or masonry reservoirs, typically above grade or
semi-buried, used on smaller holdings for short-term storage adjacent to the irrigation
distribution point. They range from 10 m³ (small quinta) to 2,000 m³ (commercial market
garden). The concrete structure is prone to cracking as the reservoir ages, and EPDM lining
is the most effective rehabilitation solution for leaking tanques.

### Açudes (Check Dams and Weir Reservoirs)

Açudes are small dams across seasonal watercourses (ribeiros), creating an impoundment that
captures and holds winter flood water. The Alentejo has thousands of açudes, many built in
the 19th and early 20th centuries in stone masonry, now deteriorating. Rehabilitation of
açude structures with EPDM lining on the upstream face and base is increasingly practised.

### Lagoas de Retenção Agrícola (Agricultural Retention Lagoons)

Larger agricultural holdings — particularly the Alentejo latifúndios growing tomato, pepper
and maize for industrial processing — require seasonal storage volumes of 10,000-500,000 m³.
These lagoas operate at the scale of small public reservoirs. EPDM lining systems for lagoas
are designed and installed differently from smaller farm ponds, with factory-vulcanised panel
seams and mechanical anchoring systems at the embankment crest.

## EPDM Performance in Agricultural Reservoir Environments

### Chemical Compatibility with Agricultural Water

Agricultural reservoir water is not pure water. It contains:
- Dissolved minerals from the catchment soil: calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese
- Organic matter from plant material, animal waste (if livestock have access), and soil microbiota
- Residual agrochemicals: if the reservoir captures run-off from treated fields, herbicides,
  fungicides and insecticides at trace levels may be present
- Fertiliser nutrients: nitrates, phosphates, potassium at varying concentrations depending
  on application practices and proximity to treated areas

EPDM's resistance to this complex chemical matrix is documented and robust:

**Fertiliser resistance:** NPK fertilisers (ammonium nitrate, urea, triple superphosphate,
potassium sulphate) are water-soluble salts. EPDM is resistant to salt solutions at any
agriculturally relevant concentration. The ammonium ion is not an EPDM degradant. The sulphate
ion is not an EPDM degradant. Nitric acid in its concentrated form attacks EPDM's polymer
chains, but dissolved nitrate at fertiliser concentrations (up to 200 mg/L NO₃⁻ in heavily
fertilised catchments) presents no chemical attack risk.

**Herbicide resistance:** the most common Portuguese agricultural herbicides — glyphosate,
2,4-D, pendimethalin, s-metolachlor, oxyfluorfen — are organic compounds that do not degrade
EPDM. Published chemical resistance data for EPDM places all common agricultural herbicides in
the "good" to "excellent" resistance category.

**pH range:** agricultural reservoir water typically has a pH of 6.5-8.0. EPDM is stable from
pH 4 to pH 12 — the agricultural pH range is well within this envelope.

### UV Resistance in Exposed Reservoir Environments

Farm reservoirs are almost universally outdoors and open to the sky. The upper margins of the
reservoir — the crest zone, the freeboard, and the section of membrane above the waterline —
are exposed to direct solar radiation. Southern Portugal has among the highest global horizontal
irradiance (GHI) in continental Europe: approximately 1,800-2,000 kWh/m²/year in the Alentejo
and Algarve.

EPDM's UV stability is intrinsic, not dependent on a sacrificial UV stabiliser layer that
depletes over time. The saturated polymer backbone (no C=C double bonds in the main chain)
is not subject to photochemical chain scission. The carbon black filler (30-50 phr in
standard EPDM formulations) acts as a broadband UV absorber with effectively unlimited service
life, converting UV radiation to heat rather than allowing it to cause photodegradation.

Published accelerated weathering data (EN ISO 4892-3, Xenon arc, 2,000 hours, equivalent to
approximately 20-30 years of Portuguese outdoor exposure):
- No surface cracking or checking
- No measurable change in tensile strength or elongation
- Colour stability within Delta-E 3 (perceptible but minor variation)

This UV stability is one of EPDM's defining advantages over HDPE in reservoir applications:
HDPE geomembranes require UV stabilisers (HALS — hindered amine light stabilisers) that
progressively deplete over 15-25 years, after which the exposed portion of the membrane
becomes vulnerable to photodegradation. EPDM requires no UV stabiliser because its
chemistry does not create a UV degradation pathway.

### Mechanical Properties Relevant to Agricultural Reservoirs

**Elongation at break (≥ 400%):** agricultural reservoir substrates are not rigid structures.
Earthen banks settle, shrink during dry periods and expand during wet periods. Tree roots in
the catchment area may grow toward the reservoir. Livestock trample the upper bank margins.
EPDM's 400%+ elongation means the membrane accommodates differential movement without
tearing — a critical advantage over rigid or semi-rigid systems (concrete lining, HDPE with
lower elongation values).

**Tear resistance (≥ 20 N/mm):** the geotextile underlay installed beneath EPDM in earthen
reservoirs provides the primary protection against puncture from stones and root protrusions.
EPDM's tear resistance provides the secondary defence when the geotextile is inadequate.

**Puncture resistance:** agricultural reservoir environments include risks from farm tools,
borehole pipe work, floating debris, and submerged irrigation equipment. EPDM at 1.0-1.5 mm
has significantly higher puncture resistance than equivalent-thickness HDPE geomembrane.

## EPDM vs HDPE vs PVC Geomembranes for Agricultural Reservoirs

The primary competing materials for agricultural reservoir waterproofing in Portugal are:
- HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) geomembrane: 1.0-2.5 mm
- LLDPE (Linear Low-Density Polyethylene): 1.0-2.0 mm
- Reinforced PVC geomembrane: 0.5-1.0 mm
- Compacted clay liner (traditional)
- Bentonite geocomposite (GCL — Geosynthetic Clay Liner)

**EPDM vs HDPE:**
HDPE is the dominant competitor in large reservoir applications (100,000+ m³). Its cost per m²
is lower than EPDM for equivalent thickness. However:
- HDPE elongation at break: typically 700-900% (exceeds EPDM), but its yield strain before
  permanent deformation is low; HDPE undergoes stress whitening and permanent set at elongations
  above 10-15% in biaxial loading — relevant for reservoirs with significant settlement
- HDPE UV resistance: depends on HALS stabilisers; 25-50 year service claims require the HALS
  to remain active throughout; EPDM has no such dependency
- HDPE seaming: requires thermal welding with specialised equipment; quality is weather-
  dependent; welding is not feasible below 5°C ambient; weld testing requires destructive
  sampling or spark testing — complex QA process
- EPDM seaming: QuickSeam tape and primer, applicable in ambient temperatures from 5°C to 40°C;
  seams do not require thermal equipment; field repairs are simple

**EPDM vs Reinforced PVC:**
Reinforced PVC is the lowest-cost option but has the shortest service life in exposed
agricultural applications. Plasticiser migration under UV and temperature causes brittleness
and cracking typically within 10-20 years. PVC is also less resistant to puncture from
agricultural debris (sharp stones, tools). The APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) does not
recommend PVC geomembranes for reservoirs near potable water catchments due to plasticiser
migration concerns.

**EPDM vs Compacted Clay:**
Compacted clay has essentially zero material cost and was the traditional solution. Its failure
mode is well-known and documented: desiccation cracking during summer dry periods creates
preferential flow paths that can reduce effective impermeability by 2-3 orders of magnitude.
Portuguese agricultural clay soils are expansive (montmorillonite-dominant), making them
particularly susceptible to cracking. Studies on Portuguese farm ponds have recorded infiltration
losses of 30-60% of stored volume per annum in clay-lined reservoirs during drought years.

**EPDM vs Bentonite Geocomposites (GCL):**
GCLs provide good impermeability when confined under overburden pressure and kept saturated.
In agricultural reservoirs that are partially drawn down or emptied for inspection, GCLs risk
desiccation and cracking without overburden confinement. EPDM does not have this constraint —
it maintains impermeability in both saturated and dry conditions.

## Sizing Agricultural Reservoirs for Crop Irrigation

The volume of an agricultural reservoir must be calculated from first principles to ensure
it meets the crop's peak water demand without drawdown to empty during the dry season.

### Key Variables

**Irrigated area (ha):** the total area served by the reservoir.

**Crop water requirement (ETc, mm/season):** evapotranspiration of the specific crop, corrected
for the crop coefficient (Kc). Reference values for Portuguese conditions:
- Olives: 250-400 mm/season (low Kc, drought-tolerant)
- Vines: 350-500 mm/season
- Citrus: 700-900 mm/season
- Tomato (industrial): 500-700 mm/season
- Horticultural vegetables: 400-600 mm/season depending on crop
- Maize: 500-700 mm/season

**Effective rainfall during irrigation season (mm):** for Alentejo, approximately 50-100 mm
May-September; for Algarve, approximately 20-50 mm. Southern Portugal's irrigation season is
effectively dry — the reservoir must supply all crop water demand.

**Irrigation system efficiency:** drip irrigation typically 90-95% efficient; sprinkler
70-85% efficient; furrow/surface 50-65% efficient.

**Minimum reservoir sizing formula:**
Volume (m³) = (ETc - Effective rainfall) × Area (m²) / (Irrigation efficiency × 1,000)

Example calculation for 10 ha of olives in Alentejo with drip irrigation:
- ETc = 350 mm; Effective rainfall = 75 mm; Irrigation demand = 275 mm
- Volume = 275 × 100,000 / (0.92 × 1,000) = 29,891 m³ ≈ 30,000 m³

This example illustrates the scale of reservoir required for commercial olive production: a
surface area of approximately 8,000-10,000 m² at 3 m average depth. The EPDM membrane area
required to line this reservoir (including slopes at 1:2) would be approximately 18,000-22,000 m².

## Portuguese Agricultural Subsidies for Reservoir Construction

### PDR2030 — Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural

PDR2030 is Portugal's rural development programme for 2021-2030, part of the EU Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) framework. It replaces PDR2020 and allocates approximately
€3.9 billion to Portuguese rural development, of which a significant share targets water
efficiency and irrigation infrastructure.

Relevant support measures for farm reservoir construction:
- **Operação 4.1 (Investimentos nas Explorações Agrícolas):** supports investments that improve
  water use efficiency, including construction of new small reservoirs and rehabilitation of
  existing ones. Eligible costs include earthworks, waterproofing membranes, pumping equipment
  and irrigation distribution. Support rates: 40% base rate, potentially reaching 60-65% for
  young farmers, disadvantaged regions, or collective projects.
- **Operação 4.3 (Infraestruturas Hidroagrícolas):** supports collective irrigation
  infrastructure, including medium and large reservoirs serving multiple producers. Eligible
  costs include dam construction, lining, distribution networks.

For individual farm reservoirs up to approximately 1,000 m³, the PDR2030 Operação 4.1 route
is the most accessible, with simplified application procedures for projects below €50,000.

### PRR — Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência

The PRR (Portugal's national recovery and resilience plan, funded by EU NextGenerationEU) includes
a specific component for water resilience in agriculture. The "Eficiência Hídrica" component
allocates funds to:
- Construction of collective water storage reservoirs
- Digitalisation of irrigation systems
- Conversion from sprinkler to drip irrigation

Some PRR funding streams are accessible to agricultural cooperatives and municipalities
(for public irrigation schemes) rather than individual farmers.

### IFAP and Application Process

Farm reservoir funding applications are processed through IFAP (Instituto de Financiamento da
Agricultura e Pescas). Applications require:
- Simplified water balance calculations demonstrating the reservoir volume is justified
- Technical specifications of the waterproofing system (membrane type, thickness, certifications)
- Environmental impact screening (for reservoirs above threshold volumes per APA requirements)
- Land registry documentation (caderneta predial) demonstrating ownership or long-term lease

Membriko can support the technical specification components of PDR2030 and PRR applications,
providing technical datasheet documentation, project drawings and membrane specifications
in the format required by IFAP.

## APA Water Regulations for Agricultural Reservoirs

### Licenciamento Hídrico

Agricultural reservoirs in Portugal that capture or store water from watercourses or
groundwater are subject to water resources licensing under the Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005) and
its Implementing Regulation (Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007). The competent authority is APA —
Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente, acting through its regional delegations (ARH — Administrações
de Região Hidrográfica).

Key licensing requirements:
- **Captação de água superficial** (surface water abstraction): reservoirs fed by stream
  diversion or run-off collection typically require a captação licence if the captured volume
  exceeds defined thresholds (generally above 5,000 m³/year for irrigation use)
- **Captação de água subterrânea** (groundwater abstraction): borehole-fed reservoirs
  require a separate captação subterrânea licence from APA; the borehole itself must be
  declared and licensed
- **Barragem de classe D** (small dam classification): earthen reservoirs above certain
  volume thresholds (generally > 100,000 m³ or > 5 m dam height) are classified as small
  dams under Decreto-Lei 21/2018 and require dam safety certification

### Reservas Ecológicas and Environmental Restrictions

Construction of agricultural reservoirs in areas classified as Reserva Ecológica Nacional
(REN) — which includes watercourse protection zones, floodplains, coastal erosion zones
and certain wetland areas — requires specific derogation from the local CCDR (Comissão de
Coordenação e Desenvolvimento Regional). The use of inert waterproofing materials (such as
EPDM) rather than potentially migrating materials (plasticised PVC) is relevant in the
environmental impact assessment for reservoirs near protected wetland areas or Natura 2000
sites.

## Integration with Drip Irrigation Systems

The combination of a lined reservoir with drip irrigation is the highest-efficiency water
management system for Portuguese agriculture. Drip irrigation delivers water at the root zone
at the exact rate the crop requires, minimising evaporation (which can account for 30-40% of
water loss in sprinkler systems) and soil moisture volatility.

Membrane penetration details for drip irrigation compatibility:
- **Pump suction fitting:** EPDM penetration sleeve with bolted compression flange; compatible
  with submersible pumps of any capacity; sleeve installed at the lowest accessible point on
  the reservoir side slope
- **Overflow/spill fitting:** EPDM penetration sleeve at the freeboard level; prevents
  reservoir overfilling during high-inflow events
- **Float valve inlet:** penetration for inlet pipe from borehole or mains supply if
  reservoir is supplemented by external source
- **Level sensor cable:** small EPDM cable penetration sleeve for electronic level monitoring
  integrated with irrigation controllers

All penetration details are designed to maintain membrane integrity and waterproofing
continuity — no generic through-hole fittings are used; all penetrations receive purpose-made
EPDM compression flanges that create a mechanical and chemical bond to the membrane.
