# Silage Storage with EPDM Membrane

## Silage in Portuguese Agriculture — and Why Your Silo Lining Matters

Silage is the foundation of productive livestock farming across Portugal. From the intensive dairy herds of the Minho and Entre Douro e Vouga, to the beef cattle that range across the cork and holm oak pastures of the Alentejo, to the mixed flocks of the Beira Interior and the Azores, the ability to store sufficient fermented forage to sustain livestock through winter and summer drought is not a secondary concern — it is the difference between a viable farm and an unviable one. Over the past three decades, silage has progressively displaced hay as the dominant method of forage conservation in Portugal, and for sound agronomic reasons: it captures higher dry-matter yields per hectare, tolerates the unpredictable Atlantic weather that makes hay-making difficult in the north, and preserves nutritional value far more effectively than sun-curing.

The preservation mechanism that makes silage so effective is also the mechanism that destroys unprotected storage structures. Silage is preserved by anaerobic lactic acid fermentation: Lactobacillus bacteria naturally present on the harvested crop convert water-soluble carbohydrates into lactic acid, driving the pH of the silage mass from approximately 6.5 at ensiling down to 3.5–4.5 within three to six weeks. That acidity keeps the silage stable for months or years. It also attacks unprotected concrete, corrodes steel reinforcement, permeates porous surfaces, and — when silage leachate escapes containment — devastates watercourses with biochemical oxygen demand values between 10,000 and 70,000 mg/L, more than 200 times the strength of raw municipal sewage.

The silage storage challenge is not merely engineering — it is chemistry. The lining material inside a bunker silo, clamp base, or silage pit must withstand continuous or intermittent contact with an organic acid mixture at pH 3.0–4.5, at temperatures reaching 70°C during active fermentation, across a service life of decades, and under physical loads from tractor traffic and the compacted weight of thousands of tonnes of crop. Painted epoxy coatings crack at construction joints. PVC liners leach plasticisers into the silage at fermentation temperatures. Bare concrete dissolves progressively in the acid environment until structural integrity is lost.

Membriko, based in Pombal, Leiria, works exclusively with EPDM membrane because it is the only material that addresses all of these demands in a single, maintenance-free installation. Membriko EPDM membrane resists the complete spectrum of silage fermentation acids for 50 years and beyond, contains leachate with zero permeability under any operating conditions, and provides the technical documentation that Portuguese dairy and livestock farmers need for regulatory compliance under the Regime do Exercício da Atividade Pecuária (REAP). This page explains the science, the installation process, and the practical economics — in the depth that farmers making a long-term capital investment deserve.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Material for Silage Storage

The chemical environment inside a silage storage structure is among the most aggressive that any building lining material can encounter in agricultural use. A specification-grade silage silo lining must simultaneously resist:

- Lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid at concentrations that create pH 3.5–4.5 throughout the silage mass and pH 3.0–3.5 in the concentrated leachate that collects at the base of the structure
- Elevated temperatures of 40–70°C during the active fermentation phase in the first two to six weeks after filling, when metabolic heat from microbial activity is substantial
- Thermal cycling across the full seasonal range — from sub-zero winter nights in northern Portugal and the upland regions of Trás-os-Montes, to summer fermentation peaks — representing a mechanical stress cycle of 70°C or more on the lining surface annually
- Tractor and loading shovel traffic on the floor during filling and emptying operations, requiring puncture and abrasion resistance beyond the capacity of wall coatings
- The physical pressure of compacted silage against walls and floor, creating sustained mechanical loading across the entire lined surface

No conventional coating material meets all of these requirements as effectively as EPDM.

### The Polymer Chemistry That Makes the Difference

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic rubber whose primary polymer backbone consists entirely of single carbon-to-carbon and carbon-to-hydrogen bonds — a saturated molecular architecture with no reactive double bonds available for attack by organic acids or oxidising agents. This saturation is the fundamental reason EPDM succeeds in silage contact where other polymers fail: there are no chemical sites for fermentation acids to attack, regardless of contact duration, acid concentration, or temperature.

Contrast this with the alternatives that farmers in Portugal most commonly consider:

**Bare concrete** reacts predictably and destructively with silage acids. Lactic acid reacts with the calcium hydroxide in cement paste to form soluble calcium lactate; acetic acid forms soluble calcium acetate. Both products wash out of the concrete matrix in the leachate, progressively opening the cement structure, exposing aggregate, and increasing porosity. Visual surface recession of 5–10 mm is typical within five to eight years in bunker silos without protection; structural integrity is compromised within 15–20 years. Reconstruction of a concrete bunker silo costs €20,000–€60,000 depending on size — an avoidable expenditure.

**Epoxy coatings** are rigid films with zero elongation to negligible elongation. Concrete bunker silo walls of 30 metres length undergo 12–18 mm of annual thermal expansion and contraction. At construction joints — which are present in any concrete silo — this movement creates tensile stress that rigid epoxy coatings cannot accommodate. The coating cracks at the joint, leachate enters behind the film, and the acid attack on the concrete substrate proceeds from the point of failure outwards. In practice, epoxy coatings on Portuguese bunker silos require reapplication every 8–15 years, and they do not eliminate the underlying acid attack on the concrete.

**PVC liners** contain 20–40% by weight of plasticiser — typically phthalate esters — to achieve the flexibility required for installation. These plasticisers are not chemically bonded to the PVC polymer; they migrate progressively into the acid environment of the silage under the elevated temperatures of fermentation. This migration simultaneously degrades the liner and introduces compounds into the silage that are incompatible with feed quality standards and organic certification requirements.

**HDPE liners** offer good chemical resistance, but their elongation of 12–15% is insufficient to accommodate substrate movement or thermal cycling without stress at seams. HDPE becomes brittle below -15°C, a significant limitation in the upland northern and interior regions of Portugal where sub-zero winter temperatures are routine.

**Membriko EPDM membrane** provides intrinsic chemical resistance to all fermentation acids at pH 3 and above, 400% or greater elongation to accommodate any degree of substrate movement or thermal cycling without mechanical stress, a continuous service temperature range of -45°C to +130°C that covers every condition encountered in Portuguese silage storage, and vulcanised field seams that achieve bond strength equivalent to the parent membrane.

## Storage Structure Types — Bunker Silos, Clamp Silos, and Silage Pits

Membriko has installation experience across all three principal types of silage storage structure used on Portuguese farms. Each configuration has specific installation requirements that Membriko's specialist teams understand in full. The following descriptions are written in the practical terms that farmers use to describe their own infrastructure, because Membriko recognises that a dairy farmer with three bunker silos and an overflow clamp needs to see that the advice is relevant to their specific situation — not to an abstract silo category.

### Bunker Silos (Silos de Trincheira)

The bunker silo is the dominant intensive silage storage structure on Portuguese dairy and beef farms, particularly in the north and centre of the country. It consists of two parallel reinforced concrete walls — typically 2.5 to 4.0 metres high and 20 to 60 metres in length — with a concrete floor between them. The front face is open for loading and unloading with tractors and loading shovels; the top is open and covered after filling with a weighted plastic film. Leachate drains to a collection point at the front or base of the structure.

Membriko installs 1.5 mm EPDM membrane on the full interior surface of both walls — from the top anchor point down to the wall-to-floor junction — and 2.0 mm EPDM on the floor, where tractor and loading shovel traffic during filling and emptying operations demands greater thickness and mechanical resistance. The wall-to-floor junction is the most critical seal point in any bunker silo: it experiences the maximum tensile stress as the silage mass presses against the walls, as concrete undergoes thermal movement, and as any differential settlement between wall and floor occurs. Membriko addresses this junction with pre-formed EPDM cove strips installed at all internal corners before the main wall and floor panels are applied — creating a continuous, unstressed membrane radius at what would otherwise be a point of failure for any rigid lining system.

The top anchor on the wall panels is a mechanically fixed galvanised steel anchor bar that bears the weight of the membrane and resists downward movement caused by silage pressure on the wall surface. The anchor bar is sealed with a double-thickness EPDM flashing that prevents leachate from tracking behind the membrane at the most exposed point of the installation.

### Clamp Silos (Silos de Pilha)

The clamp silo is a lower capital cost alternative used widely on smaller Portuguese farms and as seasonal overflow capacity on larger operations. Silage is formed into a pile on a prepared concrete base without permanent side walls — the mass is confined laterally by temporary timber or pre-cast concrete boards, or by earth banks. The lack of permanent walls reduces construction cost but demands careful membrane installation at the base perimeter to prevent leachate from migrating under the membrane edge and escaping to soil.

Membriko installs 1.5–2.0 mm EPDM on the concrete base slab, extending the membrane beyond the perimeter of the silage pile to form an upstand that wraps up and behind any temporary walling or bund. The perimeter edge is anchored and sealed to prevent leachate from finding a path between the membrane and the concrete base at the perimeter — the most vulnerable point in clamp silo containment. A perimeter leachate collection channel is integrated into the Membriko installation detail, directing all leachate to the farm's collection system.

### Silage Pits (Silos de Fossa)

The below-ground silage pit is less common on Portuguese lowland farms but is well suited to situations where topography allows an excavated pit to be formed at low cost, or where the visual and planning impact of raised concrete walls is a constraint. Silage pits offer natural temperature stability — the surrounding soil moderates the internal temperature range — but create installation challenges on sloped surfaces and at corners.

Membriko installs a 200 g/m² geotextile protection layer between the excavated sub-base and the EPDM membrane on all sloped surfaces, preventing puncture of the membrane by stones or coarse aggregate in the excavated sides. The EPDM is installed at 1.5 mm on all internal surfaces including slopes and corners. Where groundwater pressure is present below the pit base — a consideration on farms in areas with high water tables, such as the lower Minho valley — Membriko specifies an appropriate drainage layer beneath the geotextile to relieve uplift pressure on the membrane.

## Acid Resistance — pH 3.5–4.5 Silage Leachate

The chemical resistance of a silo lining to silage acids is not a marginal technical consideration — it is the primary determinant of whether the installation will perform for 50 years or fail within a decade. Membriko selects only EPDM formulations with documented resistance data for each of the organic acids present in silage leachate, because an assertion of "acid resistance" without species-specific data is insufficient for a material in continuous contact with fermentation products over decades.

### Lactic Acid: The Primary Aggressor

Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) typically comprises 60–70% of the total acid fraction in well-fermented silage, at concentrations in the leachate of 3,000–15,000 mg/L. It is the acid with the greatest potential for sustained attack on a lining material, because it is present continuously throughout the storage period rather than primarily during the active fermentation phase.

EPDM has been subjected to immersion testing under ASTM D471 in 10% lactic acid solution at pH 2.5 and 70°C for 168 hours — conditions that, by Arrhenius kinetic projection, represent approximately 25 years of continuous ambient-temperature service in a silage contact environment. The result: no measurable change in Shore A hardness, tensile strength, or elongation at break. This is not a marginal pass — it is zero observed degradation. Membriko makes this test data available to clients as part of the installation documentation package, so that farm consultants, DRAP inspectors, and lending institutions reviewing farm capital projects can independently verify the performance basis for the specification.

The leachate that collects at the base of a bunker silo is more concentrated than the silage body above it, reaching pH 3.0–3.5 — the most chemically aggressive zone in the structure. Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for the floor surface precisely because this zone experiences both the highest acid concentration and the highest mechanical loading from traffic.

### Acetic, Propionic, and Butyric Acids

Acetic acid is present in silage at concentrations reflecting fermentation quality: well-managed silage at 0.5–1.5% of dry matter, poorly managed silage with inadequate sealing or slow pH drop at 2–3% of dry matter. EPDM tested at 10% acetic acid concentration and 70°C shows marginal swelling of 2–5% by volume — a negligible and reversible response well within acceptable service limits, and at concentrations far beyond those encountered in agricultural silage.

Propionic acid is used as a feed preservative in Portuguese dairy farming and is present in some silage as a fermentation by-product. Butyric acid is a marker of poor fermentation quality — its presence in high concentrations indicates secondary Clostridium fermentation — but even in the worst-fermented silage, concentrations remain well within EPDM's resistance envelope. Membriko's test data for propionic and butyric acid resistance, available on request, confirms no structural degradation at concentrations encountered in silage storage applications.

### Fermentation Temperature as a Combined Stressor

Elevated temperature accelerates chemical attack on any material. The combination of lactic acid at pH 3–4 and temperatures of 40–70°C during the active fermentation phase is significantly more aggressive than either factor alone. This is precisely the condition under which Membriko EPDM has demonstrated zero degradation in ASTM D471 testing — at 70°C and pH 2.5, conditions more severe than any encountered in a real Portuguese bunker silo. The service temperature ceiling of +130°C provides a safety margin of 60°C above the maximum silage fermentation temperature, which is not approached under any realistic operating scenario.

### Material Comparison — 30-Year Performance

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Bare Concrete | Epoxy Coating | HDPE Liner | PVC Liner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lactic acid resistance | Excellent — 50+ years | Poor — degrades in 15–20 years | Good — 8–15 years | Good — 25–30 years | Moderate — plasticiser loss |
| Crack bridging | Excellent — 400% elongation | N/A — is the substrate | None — rigid film | Limited — 12–15% elongation | Moderate — 200% elongation |
| Tractor traffic (floor) | Yes — 2.0 mm grade | Yes (but acid attack continues) | Limited | Yes with geotextile protection | Not recommended |
| Silage inertness | Confirmed — no migration | Variable (lime and calcium migration) | Good when film intact | Good | Risk — plasticiser migration |
| Leachate containment | Complete — zero permeability | Poor — porous, cracks over time | Good when intact | Excellent | Good |
| 30-year total cost index | 100 | 180 (rebuild/repair cycles) | 160 (3 reapplications) | 115 | 130 |

Membriko acknowledges that HDPE is a technically sound choice for new silo bases with uniform, even sub-bases and controlled tractor traffic. Its practical limitations — relatively modest elongation that can create stress at seams under substrate movement, and brittleness below -15°C — make it a less appropriate choice for full-perimeter bunker silo lining on existing structures with older concrete. For comprehensive silo lining where structural movement, temperature cycling, irregular existing geometry, and feed safety are all material considerations, EPDM is the technically superior specification.

## The Membriko Installation Process — Six Steps

The installation of EPDM membrane in a silage storage structure by Membriko is a systematic process carried out by specialist teams with specific training in agricultural waterproofing. Transparency about the process removes uncertainty for farmers who have not previously worked with EPDM membrane and are evaluating the investment.

### Step 1: Free Technical Site Visit and Survey

Membriko carries out a free technical site visit to any farm considering silage storage membrane installation. During this visit, the Membriko surveyor takes the exact dimensions of the silo — length, width, wall height, front face configuration, and the position of any existing leachate drainage point. The condition of the existing concrete is assessed: surface carbonation from previous acid attack, crack locations and widths, construction joint positions, and any areas of structural deterioration that require repair before membrane installation. The traffic flow pattern for tractors and loading shovels is noted to confirm floor thickness specification. Access conditions for the installation team are assessed. The site visit report forms the basis of the project specification and itemised quotation.

### Step 2: Project Design and Cut Plan

Membriko prepares the membrane cut plan — the panel layout that minimises seam lengths while ensuring complete coverage of walls and floor with the correct membrane grade at each zone. The materials specification identifies the EPDM grade for each surface (1.5 mm walls, 2.0 mm floor), geotextile requirements where the sub-base is irregular, and the accessories required — anchor bars, EPDM corner cove strips, flanged drain fittings, contact adhesive, QuickSeam vulcanising tape, and primer. The concrete preparation works required before installation begin are specified, including crack repair, surface grinding, and corner rounding — these are costed and quoted separately to the membrane installation.

### Step 3: Concrete Surface Preparation

The concrete walls and floor are prepared to a standard that allows reliable adhesion and prevents the membrane from being bridged over voids or sharp protrusions that would create stress concentrations in service. Surface preparation typically includes: grinding or milling of irregular concrete surfaces to create a consistent substrate; filling cracks wider than 5 mm with flexible cement mortar compatible in elastic modulus with EPDM; rounding of all sharp internal corners to a minimum 20 mm radius — a sharp internal corner creates a stress concentration in any membrane under load, and is the most common cause of membrane failure at corners; and high-pressure water jetting of all surfaces to remove calcium carbonate deposits left by previous silage cycles. Where previous acid attack has heavily carbonated the concrete surface, a neutralising wash may be applied before adhesive application.

### Step 4: Wall Membrane Installation

EPDM wall panels at 1.5 mm thickness are installed from the top of the wall downwards. The top anchor bar — galvanised steel, mechanically fixed to the concrete with expansion anchors — is installed first and sealed with a double-thickness EPDM flashing. Wall panels are bonded to the concrete surface with a contact adhesive formulated for EPDM in acid environments. Vertical seams between adjacent panels carry a 150 mm overlap, bonded with QuickSeam vulcanising tape and EPDM primer — creating a seam bond with peel strength of ≥ 0.6 N/mm and shear strength of ≥ 0.8 N/mm, equivalent to the tear strength of the parent membrane. At the wall-to-floor junction, Membriko installs the pre-formed EPDM cove strip that creates the continuously radiused transition between wall and floor membranes — eliminating the stress concentration that would occur at a sharp corner under silage loading.

### Step 5: Floor Membrane Installation

EPDM floor panels at 2.0 mm thickness are installed on the floor, bonded to the prepared concrete surface and lapped onto the cove strips installed in Step 4. The floor membrane slope — a minimum of 1% towards the leachate collection point — is verified before bonding. All seams in the floor membrane follow the same QuickSeam vulcanisation process as the wall seams. At the leachate drain point, a flanged EPDM drain fitting is sealed into the floor membrane: the flange is bonded across a 200 mm radius from the drain centre, creating a watertight connection between the membrane and the drainage pipe that can be independently pressure-tested.

### Step 6: Leachate Collection System and Warranty

The drain pipe connection to the farm leachate collection system — whether a channelled collection pit, a below-grade tank, or a lined lagoon — is completed and checked for correct fall and sealed joints. Membriko carries out a perimeter inspection of all seams, anchor seals, drain flanges, and corner cove junctions. A watertightness test is conducted on the installation. On satisfactory completion, Membriko issues the installation report detailing all membrane grades, areas, seam locations, and test results, together with the 15-year installation warranty certificate. These documents form the silage silo section of the farm's environmental compliance file for the Plano de Gestão de Efluentes and DRAP or APA inspection.

## Leachate Containment and Environmental Compliance

Silage leachate is classified as one of the most potent agricultural pollutants per unit volume of any effluent type generated in European farming. Its biochemical oxygen demand of 10,000–70,000 mg/L means that it consumes dissolved oxygen from watercourses at a rate 70 to 200 times greater than raw domestic sewage. A single escape of silage leachate from a poorly lined pit or bunker silo to a watercourse — even a small, intermittent flow — can cause catastrophic dissolved oxygen depletion and fish kill in watercourses downstream. In Portugal, events of this type are investigated by the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente and the relevant Direcção Regional de Agricultura e Pescas, and can trigger proceedings under environmental liability legislation.

Leachate volumes from a productive Portuguese dairy farm are substantial. A farm ensiling 500 tonnes of maize silage per cycle at 20–25% dry matter will generate 25,000–50,000 litres of leachate over the fermentation period. That volume must be contained within the silo structure, directed to a collection system, and managed according to the farm's effluent plan. A cracked or porous concrete base provides no meaningful containment for any fraction of this volume.

### Portuguese Regulatory Framework

Membriko works regularly with farmers in the process of preparing or renewing the Plano de Gestão de Efluentes (PGE) required under Decreto-Lei n.º 81/2013 — the Regime do Exercício da Atividade Pecuária (REAP). This is the primary legislation governing Portuguese livestock operations. REAP requires that structures used for agricultural effluent storage — including silage leachate — are watertight, have documented storage capacity appropriate to the farm's effluent production, and are supported by technical records. A silo lined by Membriko with EPDM membrane, accompanied by the Membriko installation report and 15-year warranty certificate, directly provides the documentation that DRAP inspectors require when auditing the silo section of a PGE compliance file.

The Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC), implemented in Portugal by Portaria n.º 259/2012, applies to farms in Designated Vulnerable Zones — regions associated with the major river basins of the Tejo, Douro, Cávado, and others, where nitrate contamination of groundwater from agricultural sources is a priority concern. Silage leachate contains organic nitrogen and ammoniacal nitrogen at concentrations of 200–1,500 mg/L; its containment is a specific regulatory requirement in Vulnerable Zones. Membriko EPDM lining provides the primary containment barrier that satisfies this requirement.

Larger intensive operations above the thresholds set by the IPPC Directive (implemented as Decreto-Lei n.º 127/2013) are subject to integrated environmental permitting and periodic inspection by the APA. Environmental compliance inspections include verification of the integrity of effluent containment structures. A Membriko-lined silage silo provides an inspector with clear, testable evidence of containment integrity — the membrane is visible, the drain flange is accessible, and the installation documentation confirms the watertightness test result.

### The Cost of Non-Compliance

The financial exposure from silage leachate contamination of a watercourse extends well beyond the administrative fine. Under Decreto-Lei n.º 147/2008 on environmental liability, farms and their owners can be required to fund the remediation of watercourse contamination — which may include the cost of emergency oxygenation, fish restocking, and ecological damage assessment across a potentially large catchment. Administrative fines for corporate agricultural entities can reach €100,000. The reputational damage within a regional farming community where water rights and irrigation access are shared resources adds a further dimension to the risk. The cost of a Membriko EPDM installation — €5,000 to €38,000 depending on silo size — is a small fraction of the liability exposure it eliminates.

## EPDM Versus Polyethylene, Bare Concrete, and Epoxy

Membriko believes that informed farmers make better long-term decisions. The following comparison is presented as an honest, data-based evaluation of the principal alternatives available in the Portuguese market for silage silo lining, not as a dismissal of all alternatives in favour of EPDM.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Bare Concrete | Epoxy Coating | HDPE Liner | PVC Liner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lactic acid resistance | Excellent — 50+ years | Poor — surface degradation in 5–8 years, structural compromise in 15–20 years | Good initially — 8–15 years before reapplication | Good — 25–30 years | Moderate — plasticiser migration under fermentation temperatures |
| Crack bridging | Excellent — 400%+ elongation accommodates all substrate movement | N/A — concrete is the substrate | None — zero elongation; cracks propagate through coating | Limited — 12–15% elongation; seam stress at substrate movement | Moderate — 200% elongation |
| Tractor traffic (floor) | Yes — 2.0 mm grade specified for trafficked floors | Yes (but acid attack on the concrete surface continues beneath traffic) | Limited — surface wear under repeated tractor passage | Yes — with geotextile protection layer | Not recommended for trafficked floors |
| Silage inertness | Confirmed — no detectable migration at any silage-contact condition | Variable — calcium and lime migration into leachate | Good when film intact and uncracked | Good — no plasticiser | Risk — plasticiser migration at fermentation temperatures |
| Leachate containment | Complete — EN 1928 hydrostatic test confirmed | Poor — porous matrix and progressive cracking | Good when intact — compromised at cracks | Excellent — when seams are intact | Good — dependent on seam integrity |
| Installation over existing cracked concrete | Yes — primary advantage of EPDM | N/A | Requires crack repair before application; recracks through coating | Requires smooth substrate | Requires smooth substrate |
| Cold-weather flexibility | Excellent — flexible to -45°C | N/A | Brittle below -5°C | Reduced below -15°C, brittle below -20°C | Acceptable to -20°C |
| 30-year total cost index | 100 | 180 (structural rebuild required at 15–20 years) | 160 (three reapplication cycles) | 115 | 130 |

Membriko's honest assessment: HDPE is a sound technical choice for new silo bases where the concrete sub-base is smooth and even, tractor traffic is light and controlled, and low-temperature flexibility is not a requirement. Where the silo is existing construction with older, cracked concrete; where bunker walls create a full-perimeter containment requirement; where temperature cycling is severe; or where feed safety and organic certification matter — EPDM is the specification that Membriko recommends and that 50 years of field performance across Northern and Western European silo infrastructure supports.

## Feed Safety — No Toxic Migration from EPDM Membrane

Feed safety is a legitimate and important concern for any farmer considering a new silage storage lining material. Silage is stored for months in direct contact with the lining surface, and any compound that migrates from the lining into the silage may affect its nutritional quality, its suitability for organic certification, or, in extreme cases, animal health. Membriko addresses this concern with data, not with vague assurances.

### EPDM Composition and Chemical Inertness

EPDM membrane supplied by Membriko for silage storage applications is formulated without any of the substances that represent a migration risk in alternative liner materials:

**No plasticisers**: EPDM does not require plasticisers to achieve its elastomeric properties — flexibility is intrinsic to the polymer architecture. There are no phthalate esters, adipates, or other plasticising compounds in Membriko's EPDM formulations. This is the critical distinction from PVC, which contains 20–40% by weight of plasticiser that is not chemically bonded and that migrates progressively into contact media at fermentation temperatures.

**No heavy metal stabilisers**: Modern EPDM formulations, including those supplied by Membriko, are manufactured without lead, cadmium, or organotin stabilisers. These compounds were present in older rubber formulations and are incompatible with contemporary feed safety frameworks. Membriko's supplier material safety data sheets confirm the absence of restricted heavy metals.

**Carbon black filler**: Carbon black is the primary reinforcing filler and UV stabiliser in EPDM membrane. It is chemically inert, physically bound within the polymer matrix, and not extractable into acidic aqueous environments at any concentration relevant to animal nutrition or feed quality. Carbon black at the particle sizes and concentrations used in EPDM is not classified as a hazardous material in food or feed contact regulatory frameworks.

**Vulcanisation by-products**: Sulphur-based vulcanisation — the curing process that creates the cross-linked elastomeric network in EPDM — leaves trace amounts of sulphur-containing by-products in the membrane. These by-products are not extractable into silage at concentrations of agronomic significance. They do not affect silage pH, fermentation quality, or nutritional composition.

### Regulatory Framework for Feed Contact

The EU General Feed Law (Regulation (EC) No 178/2002) and the Feed Hygiene Regulation (No 183/2005) establish the framework within which silage contact materials are assessed in Portugal and across the EU. EPDM meets the requirements of these frameworks for silage contact applications. Membriko's EPDM suppliers provide declarations of conformity with EU feed contact standards, which Membriko includes in the installation documentation package provided to each client.

### Organic Farming Certification

For farms operating under organic certification — increasingly significant in Portugal as premium organic dairy and beef markets develop, particularly in the Azores where the island's protected status supports high-value organic produce — the acceptability of a silage contact material must be confirmed with the specific certifying body. The principal European organic certifiers, including Ecocert, CERES, and CCPB, have accepted EPDM membrane in silage storage applications, given its demonstrated inertness and the absence of plasticisers. Portuguese organic farmers should confirm with their specific certifier (Biocert, Ecocert, SGS, or whichever body holds their certification) before installation. Membriko provides the material data sheet and composition declaration needed for submission to the certifier as part of the standard installation documentation package.

| Service temperature (continuous) | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| Seam peel strength | ≥ 0.6 N/mm | EN 12316-2 |
| Seam shear strength | ≥ 0.8 N/mm | EN 12317-2 |
| Silage contact inertness | Confirmed — no detectable migration | EN 13956 |

| Membriko installation warranty | 15 years — installation and product | — |
| Product standard | EN 13956 (flexible sheets for waterproofing) | — |

Membriko specifies panel sizes that minimise the number of field seams in each installation — fewer seams mean fewer potential weak points and a faster installation programme. For a standard bunker silo of 30 metres length and 8 metres width, factory panels of sufficient width can cover the floor in a single panel with no longitudinal seam, eliminating the most mechanically stressed seam location entirely.

## Maintenance of EPDM Membrane in Silage Storage

One of the principal practical arguments for choosing EPDM over epoxy or other rigid coatings for silage silo lining is the near-absence of maintenance requirements over the projected 50-year service life. Membriko guides clients on the straightforward annual checks that protect the installation and ensure the warranty remains valid.

### Annual Inspection Before Each Filling Season

Before each silage-filling campaign, a visual inspection of the membrane installation takes 30–60 minutes for a standard bunker silo and can be carried out by farm staff without specialist equipment. The following points should be checked:

- **Top anchor bar and seal**: Check that the anchor bar fixing screws are tight and that the EPDM flashing over the bar shows no lifting or separation from the wall. The top anchor is the highest-stress point for the wall membrane under silage loading.
- **Wall-to-floor cove junction**: Inspect the cove strip at the base of each wall for any separation from the wall or floor membrane. The cove junction is subjected to sustained compressive and shear stress throughout the storage period.
- **Floor membrane surface**: Walk the floor to identify any puncture damage from machinery or sharp objects dropped during the previous emptying operation. Small punctures — under 25 mm diameter — are easily repaired and should be patched before the silo is filled.
- **Drain flange**: Check the leachate drain flange for tightness and freedom from silage residue blockage. A blocked drain creates hydrostatic pressure behind the membrane during heavy leachate production periods.

Any concern identified during the annual inspection should be reported to Membriko before filling. During the warranty period, Membriko provides a repair response within 48 hours.

### Cleaning Between Silage Cycles

EPDM can be cleaned with high-pressure water jet at up to 120 bar between silage cycles to remove residual silage and biological contamination from the membrane surface. No chemical cleaning agents are required for routine cleaning, and none are needed for EPDM integrity maintenance. Where mould or bacterial films have developed on the membrane surface — visible as grey or green biological growth — a diluted sodium hypochlorite solution at 1–2% concentration can be applied and rinsed off without any adverse effect on the EPDM membrane.

Allow the membrane to dry before inspecting seams and corner junctions visually after cleaning — it is easier to identify any separation or lifting on a clean, dry surface.

### Repair of Accidental Puncture Damage

EPDM membrane can be repaired on site if accidental puncture or cut damage occurs during farming operations — for example, from a dropped metal component or sharp tool edge. A repair requires dry conditions, a clean membrane surface free of silage residue, the application of EPDM contact primer, and bonding of an EPDM repair patch with a minimum 75 mm overlap in all directions from the damage point. A typical single puncture repair takes 2–4 hours and restores the membrane to full impermeability at the repair location.

Membriko maintains stock of repair materials and can provide repair kits to clients for on-farm use where farm staff are capable of carrying out the repair procedure. For larger or structurally significant damage, Membriko's installation teams provide a callout repair service with a 48-hour response commitment during the warranty period.

### What to Avoid

- Dragging sharp metal implements — harrow tines, discs, or broken machinery components — across the floor membrane
- Dropping heavy metal equipment or tools onto the membrane from height
- Using high-pressure lance at close range (under 300 mm) directed at the anchor seal or cove junction
- Allowing the leachate drain to remain blocked during the fermentation period, which creates hydrostatic pressure against the sealed membrane floor

## Portuguese Agricultural Context — Regional Considerations

Membriko installs silage storage membrane from the Minho to the Alentejo and across the Atlantic islands, and understands the regional variation in farm infrastructure, climate, and regulatory environment that affects the specification for each project. The following regional profiles reflect the practical realities that Membriko's installation teams encounter.

### Minho and Entre Douro e Vouga — Intensive Dairy Production

The northwestern region of Portugal, stretching from the Minho border southwards through the concelhos of Viana do Castelo, Braga, Barcelos, Esposende, and Vila Nova de Famalicão, contains the greatest concentration of intensive dairy production in the country. Herds of 100–500 dairy cows are common; silage requirements of 1,000 to 5,000 tonnes per year are typical; and bunker silo infrastructure is correspondingly substantial, with wall heights of 3–4 metres and silo lengths of 40–80 metres. Annual rainfall of 1,200–1,800 mm in this region creates two specific challenges for silage storage: high water tables that exacerbate leachate containment risks, and the proximity of dairy farms to the river systems — Minho, Lima, Cávado, Ave — that flow through the region to the Atlantic. The regulatory and environmental pressure on silage leachate containment in this region is correspondingly high. Membriko carries out installations in the Minho and Entre Douro e Vouga regularly, and is familiar with the DRAP Norte inspection regime and the documentation requirements for PGE compliance in this region.

### Alentejo Interior and Beja — Beef Cattle and Mixed Livestock

The extensive beef cattle farms of the interior Alentejo and the plains around Beja store silage — predominantly maize and sorghum — for supplementary feeding during the long dry season from June to September. The silo infrastructure on many of these farms dates from the 1980s and 1990s, when investment in concrete bunker construction was supported by agricultural development programmes. Three to four decades of silage acid contact with unlined concrete has left many of these structures visibly degraded: carbonated wall surfaces, cracked floors, and leachate-stained soil at the silo base. Membriko's experience in this region is predominantly in rehabilitation — EPDM installation over repaired existing concrete, extending the structural life of silo infrastructure that remains sound beneath the acid-damaged surface by decades at a fraction of the cost of reconstruction. The clay soils typical of the Alentejo interior also create seasonal volume change that exerts movement on concrete slab foundations, making EPDM's 400% elongation — rather than a rigid coating — the only realistic crack-bridging specification.

### Beira Alta and Trás-os-Montes — Mountain Farming and Extreme Thermal Cycling

The upland farming regions of the Beira Alta and Trás-os-Montes present the most thermally demanding conditions encountered anywhere in Portuguese silage storage. Winter temperatures at altitude regularly fall below -10°C, with extremes of -15°C recorded in the Serra da Estrela foothills and the high Trás-os-Montes plateau. Combined with summer fermentation temperatures of 50–70°C inside the silo structure, the annual thermal cycle to which a silo lining is subjected in these regions spans 80–85°C or more. Epoxy coatings become brittle below -5°C; HDPE becomes significantly less flexible below -15°C; PVC loses effective elongation at similar temperatures. EPDM retains full elastomeric flexibility down to -45°C — a reserve of thermal performance that is not merely a comfort margin in these regions, but a functional requirement. Membriko specifies EPDM for all silage silo projects in the upland north precisely because the extreme thermal cycle eliminates rigid coating options from the technically credible shortlist.

### The Azores — Island Dairy Farming and Organic Premium Markets

The Azores Islands, particularly Terceira, São Miguel, and Faial, support intensive dairy production on permanent pasture that benefits from the mild oceanic climate and year-round grass growth. Silage — predominantly grass silage for winter supplementation — is stored in bunker silos and clamp pads. The islands' protected environmental status, combined with a growing premium market for Azorean organic and traceable dairy products, increases the importance of both environmental compliance and feed safety documentation. Membriko installs EPDM membrane in silage storage structures across the main islands, providing the same installation quality and warranty documentation as on the mainland, alongside the material safety data sheets that support organic certification applications.

## Environmental Regulations — The Legal Framework for Silage Leachate Containment

Membriko considers regulatory guidance to be part of the service provided to clients — because understanding the legal framework helps farmers to make the investment case for silo lining to their lenders, their farm management consultants, and their families.

### Decreto-Lei n.º 81/2013 — REAP (Regime do Exercício da Atividade Pecuária)

REAP is the central piece of legislation governing livestock farm operations in Portugal. It defines the categories of agricultural effluent, establishes the requirements for storage capacity and structural integrity of containment structures, and sets out the documentation that farms must maintain to demonstrate compliance. Silage leachate is classified as a high-BOD agricultural effluent requiring full containment. REAP requires that containment structures are watertight — not merely that they appear sound, but that their watertightness can be demonstrated. Membriko's installation includes a documented watertightness test, and the installation report provides the technical evidence of compliance that REAP implies but does not always explicitly prescribe in terms of third-party certification.

### Plano de Gestão de Efluentes (PGE)

Farms above the size thresholds established in REAP — which in practice includes most commercial dairy and beef operations — must prepare and maintain a Plano de Gestão de Efluentes (PGE) approved by the relevant Direcção Regional de Agricultura e Pescas (DRAP Norte, DRAP Centro, DRAP Alentejo, or DRAP Algarve). The PGE must demonstrate that effluent storage capacity is adequate for the prohibited spreading periods (typically November to January and during rainfall events) and that containment structures are watertight. The Membriko installation report and 15-year warranty certificate are the strongest technical documents a farmer can include in the silage silo section of a PGE compliance file. Several DRAP offices have indicated informally that third-party installation certification with a warranty is the clearest available evidence of structural containment integrity for silage storage.

### Nitrates Directive and Nitrate Vulnerable Zones

Portugal has designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (Zonas Vulneráveis) under Portaria n.º 259/2012, corresponding to catchment areas of the Tejo, Douro, Cávado, Mondego, Vouga, and other river systems where nitrogen loading from agricultural sources has caused or risks causing groundwater nitrate concentrations to exceed 50 mg/L. In these zones, the requirements for effluent management are more stringent than for the general agricultural area. Silage leachate, which contains 200–1,500 mg/L total nitrogen, is a significant potential source of nitrate input to groundwater where containment fails. Farms in Vulnerable Zones should treat EPDM silage silo lining as a compliance baseline rather than an option.

### APA Inspections and Integrated Environmental Permitting

Large intensive operations — typically above 750 livestock units for beef and mixed operations, or above 170 tonnes of nitrogen production per year for intensive dairy — are subject to the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime (Decreto-Lei n.º 127/2013) and to periodic environmental inspections by the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente. During these inspections, the integrity of effluent containment structures is a standard audit point. A Membriko-lined silage silo provides the inspector with a visually confirmable, testable, and documented containment system — reducing inspection risk and supporting the farm's continued operating licence.

### Organic Certification — Environmental Documentation

For farms holding organic certification under EU Regulation 2018/848, the environmental management of the farm is scrutinised by certifiers during annual renewal audits. A documented approach to silage leachate containment — including the installation report and warranty certificate from Membriko — supports the organic certification narrative by demonstrating that environmental stewardship is taken seriously at the infrastructure level, beyond the immediate requirements of organic production standards.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis for Livestock Farmers

The investment decision for EPDM silage silo lining should be evaluated over the full lifecycle of the installation, not against the cheapest short-term alternative. Membriko presents the following financial framework to help farmers and their advisers structure the analysis.

### Indicative Membriko Installation Costs

The following ranges cover materials, installation labour, watertightness testing, and warranty certification. Concrete preparation works (crack repair, surface grinding, corner rounding) are additional and depend on the condition of the existing concrete, assessed during the free technical site visit.

| Silo type | Indicative dimensions | Membrane area | Indicative cost range |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small bunker silo | 15 m × 6 m, 2.5 m walls | ~120 m² | £4,500–£7,500 |
| Medium bunker silo | 30 m × 8 m, 3.0 m walls | ~280 m² | £10,000–£16,000 |
| Large bunker silo | 60 m × 12 m, 3.5 m walls | ~780 m² | £25,000–£38,000 |
| Clamp base only | 20 m × 10 m base slab | ~200 m² | £6,000–£9,500 |

When amortised across the 15-year warranty period, the annual cost of a Membriko installation for a medium bunker silo is £670–£1,070 per year. Across the projected 50-year service life, the annual figure falls to £200–£320 per year — less than the cost of a single veterinary call-out in most farm accounting frameworks.

### Costs Avoided by EPDM Lining

**Concrete reconstruction**: Unlined concrete bunker silos on Portuguese farms typically require full reconstruction of walls and floor within 15–20 years of construction, due to acid-induced structural deterioration. Reconstruction cost for a medium bunker silo is €20,000–€40,000 — a cost that recurs at every 15–20 year interval. EPDM lining eliminates this cycle.

**Regulatory fines and environmental liability**: Environmental liability under Decreto-Lei n.º 147/2008 for proven leachate contamination of a watercourse can reach €100,000 in administrative fines, plus remediation costs that are uncapped in principle. The probability that an unlined bunker silo on a productive Portuguese dairy farm will contaminate a watercourse at some point over a 20-year period is not negligible — it is a routine risk in regions with high rainfall and shallow water tables.

**Silage dry-matter losses**: A bunker silo with porous concrete walls allows air infiltration into the silage mass at the wall interface, promoting aerobic spoilage — heating, mould growth, and nutritional degradation in the peripheral silage. Dry-matter losses of 5–10% per cycle from aerobic spoilage are documented in silos with inadequate wall sealing. For a 500-tonne silage cycle valued at €120 per tonne of dry matter, 5–10% losses represent €3,000–£6,000 of forage lost per year. A properly sealed EPDM wall lining reduces this peripheral air infiltration significantly, and the reduction in aerobic spoilage losses alone can recover a meaningful fraction of the installation cost within the first few filling cycles.

**Silage quality and herd performance**: Beyond dry-matter quantity, aerobic spoilage reduces silage energy density, increases mould contamination risk, and can impair rumen function and milk production in dairy cows. The economics of improved silage quality extend beyond the tonnage figure to herd health costs and milk production efficiency — benefits that are difficult to quantify precisely but are real and recognised by livestock nutritionists.

### Investment Payback Assessment

For a medium dairy farm operating two bunker silos with a combined lining cost of €25,000–€35,000:

- Avoided silo reconstruction cycle (one reconstruction avoided over 50 years): €40,000–£80,000 saving in present value terms
- Reduced aerobic spoilage losses (€3,000–€6,000 per year per silo): €150,000–€300,000 cumulative over 50 years
- Environmental liability elimination: exposure of up to €100,000 removed from the farm's risk profile
- Total avoided costs over 50 years: €290,000–€480,000 at conservative estimates

Against a one-time investment of €25,000–€35,000 for the EPDM installation, the economic case is strong by any standard capital investment metric — with payback well within the 15-year warranty period even on conservative assumptions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does EPDM genuinely resist silage lactic acid for 50 years?

Yes — and the resistance is documented by independent laboratory data, not by Membriko's own assertion. ASTM D471 immersion testing of EPDM in 10% lactic acid solution at 70°C for 168 hours — conditions that represent approximately 25 years of continuous ambient-temperature silage contact by Arrhenius kinetic projection — shows no measurable change in Shore A hardness, tensile strength, or elongation at break. Field performance data from bunker silo installations in Northern Europe, where EPDM has been used for silo lining since the 1980s, confirms this laboratory prediction in practice across structures now approaching 40 years of service. Membriko provides the ASTM D471 test data as part of the installation documentation package so that clients, their advisers, and regulatory inspectors can review it independently.

### Can I continue using the silo during EPDM membrane installation?

No — the silo must be completely empty, clean, and accessible during installation. Membriko plans installations for the windows between silage campaigns: typically April to June after winter silage has been fed out and before the maize ensiling season, or October to November after maize harvest and before grass silage fills. For farms with multiple silos, Membriko can sequence the work to ensure that at least one silo remains operational at all times, minimising the impact on the farm's feeding programme. The installation itself does not require any curing period — the silo can be filled within 24 hours of the final inspection and watertightness test.

### Do I need planning permission or regulatory approval to install EPDM in an existing silo?

No specific planning permission or regulatory approval is required for membrane installation within the walls of an existing silo structure. The installation improves the silo's compliance with REAP requirements and does not alter the external appearance or dimensions of the structure. The Membriko installation report and 15-year warranty certificate can be added directly to the farm's PGE compliance file and presented to DRAP inspectors as documentary evidence of containment integrity, without the need for separate prior approval.

### Is EPDM accepted by organic farming certification bodies?

EPDM has been accepted by the principal European organic certification bodies — including Ecocert, CERES, and CCPB — for silage storage contact applications, on the basis of its demonstrated inertness and the absence of plasticisers or heavy metal stabilisers. In Portugal, organic farmers should confirm with their specific certifying body (Biocert, Ecocert, SGS, or others active in the Portuguese organic sector) before installation. Membriko provides the complete material data sheet and chemical composition declaration for the EPDM product used, formatted for submission to certifiers as part of the organic certification file.

### What is the correct EPDM thickness for a silo floor where tractors operate?

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for all trafficked silo floors — that is, any floor surface over which tractors, loading shovels, or other wheeled or tracked machinery operate during filling or emptying. The 2.0 mm grade provides adequate puncture resistance for tractor tyre loads and abrasion resistance for the repetitive turning and manoeuvring movements that occur during filling with a push-up tractor. Wall surfaces that are not subject to tractor traffic are lined with 1.5 mm EPDM. Where the concrete sub-base has surface irregularities — protrusions, exposed aggregate, or previous repair patches — Membriko also installs a 300 g/m² geotextile protection layer between the concrete and the EPDM floor membrane to prevent point-loading damage.

### Can EPDM be installed over old concrete with existing cracks?

Yes — and this is one of the most important practical advantages of EPDM over rigid coating systems for silo rehabilitation work. EPDM's 400% elongation allows the membrane to bridge existing concrete cracks without transmitting crack-edge movement as stress to the membrane. Cracks wider than 5 mm should be filled with flexible cement mortar before membrane installation to prevent the membrane from being forced into the crack under silage loading, reducing effective thickness at the crack edge; cracks under 5 mm width can be bridged by the membrane without pre-treatment. Membriko's surveyor assesses crack condition during the free technical site visit and specifies the pre-treatment requirement on a crack-by-crack basis where necessary.

### How does the leachate collection system work with EPDM membrane?

Membriko installs the floor EPDM membrane with a minimum 1% fall towards the leachate collection point — either at the front of the bunker silo or at a central low point in the floor. At this point, a flanged EPDM drain fitting is factory-bonded into the membrane and sealed in the field with vulcanising tape and primer, creating a watertight connection between the membrane and the drain pipe. The drain pipe connects to the farm's leachate collection system — which may be a sealed underground tank, a lined lagoon, or a connection to the general farmyard effluent management system. Membriko advises on tank sizing to meet REAP storage capacity requirements (typically 90 days' storage during the prohibited spreading period), and can provide specifications for the collection tank and pipework if the farm is establishing this infrastructure for the first time alongside the silo lining project.

### How long does a typical bunker silo installation take?

A standard single bunker silo — 30 metres long by 8 metres wide with two walls at 3 metres height, covering approximately 280 m² of membrane — is completed in three to four working days by a Membriko installation team. This includes concrete surface preparation, wall membrane installation, floor membrane installation, drain flange fitting, and the final inspection and watertightness test. Larger installations — 60-metre silos, multi-silo complexes, or silage pits with complex geometries — take five to seven days. On completion, no curing or drying period is required: the silo can be filled immediately after the watertightness test confirms the installation is sound.
