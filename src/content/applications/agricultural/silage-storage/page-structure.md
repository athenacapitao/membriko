# Silage Storage — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The silage storage page serves Portuguese livestock farmers — primarily dairy, beef and mixed
livestock — who are making a decision about silo construction or renovation. These are practical,
technically literate buyers who understand their operational requirements but may not be familiar
with EPDM as a silo lining material.

The persuasion architecture addresses four core concerns:
1. **Chemical durability**: will EPDM actually resist silage acid for decades, or is this a
   short-lived solution like painted epoxy?
2. **Feed safety**: will EPDM contaminate the silage and affect animal health or organic certification?
3. **Regulatory compliance**: does EPDM lining satisfy Portuguese agricultural effluent regulations
   and the requirements for the Plano de Gestão de Efluentes?
4. **Practical installation**: can EPDM be installed in an existing silo, and can the silo remain
   operational while work is done?

The page must also differentiate between the three principal storage types (bunker silos, clamp
silos, silage pits) because farmers think in terms of their own infrastructure, not in abstract
technical categories. A dairy farmer with three bunker silos and a separate clamp area needs to
see that Membriko understands both configurations.

## Section 1: Introduction — Silage in Portuguese Agriculture

**Purpose:** Ground the page in the reader's agricultural context and establish the problem
clearly before presenting the solution.

**Content:**
- Silage's central role in Portuguese livestock farming: dairy in the Minho and Entre Douro e
  Vouga; beef cattle across the interior; mixed livestock in the Alentejo; the shift from hay
  to silage over the past three decades driven by mechanisation and the need for year-round
  consistent feed
- The fermentation problem: silage is preserved by lactic acid fermentation, reaching pH 3.5–4.5.
  That acidity — which makes silage nutritious and stable — is exactly what destroys unprotected
  concrete in 15–20 years and contaminates groundwater if leachate escapes
- The Membriko position: EPDM membrane is the chemical barrier that allows farmers to benefit
  from silage acidity (preservation) without suffering from its consequences (concrete degradation,
  environmental liability)
- Stats block: pH 3.5–4.5 silage acidity / 50+ years EPDM service life / 15 years Membriko
  warranty / zero leachate to soil
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Visita Técnica Gratuita"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Silage Storage

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the chemistry case for EPDM in the specific silage acid environment.

**Content:**
- The acid challenge: lactic acid + acetic acid + propionic acid mixture at pH 3.5–4.5, up to
  70°C during fermentation, continuous or intermittent contact
- EPDM's saturated polymer backbone: no reactive double bonds for organic acids to attack;
  no plasticisers to extract into the silage; thermal stability to +130°C
- Contrast with alternatives: epoxy coatings crack at concrete construction joints (zero
  elongation vs EPDM 400%+); PVC contains plasticisers that migrate into silage; unprotected
  concrete is dissolved by lactic and acetic acids within years
- Physical properties table:
  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness (walls) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Thickness (floor, trafficked) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | Lactic acid resistance | Excellent — pH 3+ | ASTM D471 |
  | Acetic acid resistance | Excellent — pH 3+ | ASTM D471 |
  | Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
  | Silage contact inertness | Confirmed | EN 13956 |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Section 3: Storage Types — Bunker Silos, Clamp Silos and Silage Pits

**Purpose:** Show mastery of all three primary silage storage configurations used in Portugal,
so farmers recognise their own infrastructure and trust the advice.

**Content:** Three configuration cards.

**Bunker Silos (Silos de Trincheira)**
- Description: three-sided concrete structure with floor and two walls; most common on intensive
  Portuguese dairy farms
- EPDM specification: 1.5 mm on walls (full height, top to base with anchor at top); 2.0 mm on
  floor (tractor-trafficked); slope to leachate drain at front
- Key detail: wall-to-floor junction is the most critical seal point; Membriko uses pre-formed
  EPDM cove strips (filete de ângulo) at all internal corners to maintain continuous membrane
  integrity under movement

**Clamp Silos (Silos de Pilha)**
- Description: open silage pile on prepared concrete base; lower capital cost; common on
  smaller Portuguese farms and for seasonal overflow capacity
- EPDM specification: 1.5–2.0 mm on concrete base; membrane extended up temporary side walls
  or bunded edge; leachate collection at base perimeter
- Key detail: membrane anchoring at base perimeter prevents leachate migration under the
  membrane edge; perimeter EPDM upstand with anchor bar and sealed edge

**Silage Pits (Silos de Fossa)**
- Description: below-ground excavated storage; used where topography or capital cost favours
  pit-form construction
- EPDM specification: 1.5 mm on all surfaces including slopes; geotextile protection layer under
  membrane on slopes; drainage layer if groundwater pressure present
- Key detail: geotextile (200 g/m²) between sub-base and EPDM prevents puncture damage from
  aggregate in the excavated sides

## Section 4: Acid Resistance — pH 3.5–4.5 Silage Effluent

**Purpose:** Address the #1 technical objection: "Can EPDM really resist silage acid long-term?"

**Content:**
- Detailed explanation of the lactic acid fermentation process and the pH 3.5–4.5 range
- ASTM D471 immersion test data: EPDM samples immersed in 10% lactic acid at 70°C for 168 hours
  (representing 25 years of ambient service) — no measurable hardness change, no loss of tensile
  strength or elongation
- Comparison table: EPDM vs bare concrete vs epoxy vs PVC vs HDPE for acid resistance, service
  life, crack-bridging, and cost over 30 years
- Fermentation temperature: internal silage temperatures of 40–70°C during active fermentation;
  EPDM's -45°C to +130°C service range provides complete safety margin
- Leachate concentration: leachate at the silo base is more concentrated than the silage body
  (pH 3.0–3.5); EPDM's resistance at pH 3+ gives confidence at this extreme

## Section 5: Installation Process (6 Steps)

**Purpose:** De-risk the purchase by making the process transparent and professional.

**Content:** Numbered process timeline.

1. **Visita Técnica e Levantamento** — Free site visit; measurement of silo dimensions; assessment
   of existing concrete condition (surface, joints, cracks); identification of leachate drain
   position and required pipe penetrations; traffic flow assessment for floor thickness specification
2. **Projeto e Dimensionamento** — Cut plan for membrane panels; specification of wall (1.5 mm) and
   floor (2.0 mm) grades; leachate collection detail; accessory list (coves, anchor bars, drain flanges)
3. **Preparação da Superfície** — Concrete grinding to remove laitance; crack repair with
   flexible cement mortar; rounding of all sharp internal corners (radius ≥ 20 mm); wall-to-floor
   junction preparation for cove installation
4. **Instalação nas Paredes** — EPDM wall panels installed top-down; top anchor bar mechanically
   fastened and sealed; panels bonded to concrete with EPDM contact adhesive; 150 mm seam overlaps
   at vertical joints; pre-formed cove strip at wall-to-floor junction
5. **Instalação no Pavimento** — Floor EPDM panels bonded to concrete; membrane continuous from
   wall junction to leachate drain; flanged drain fitting sealed to membrane; slope verified (≥ 1%)
6. **Sistema de Recolha de Lixiviado e Garantia** — Leachate drain pipe connection to collection
   tank; perimeter inspection of all seams and penetrations; watertightness test; issue of
   15-year warranty certificate and technical documentation for PGE compliance file

---

## Section 6: Effluent Containment and Environmental Compliance

**Purpose:** Address the regulatory driver that increasingly motivates silage lining investment
in Portugal — the requirement to prove leachate containment to DRAP inspectors.

**Content:**
- Portuguese regulatory framework: Decreto-Lei n.º 81/2013 (REAP) — leachate must not reach
  soil or water; Plano de Gestão de Efluentes (PGE) requires documented storage capacity and
  watertight containment
- What a Membriko installation provides for regulatory compliance: EPDM membrane as primary
  containment barrier; flanged drain fitting connecting to sealed collection tank; installation
  report confirming watertight test; 15-year warranty certificate as evidence of system reliability
- Environmental risk of non-compliance: silage leachate at BOD5 10,000–70,000 mg/L is one of
  the most potent agricultural pollutants; a single silage pit leaching to a watercourse can
  result in significant fish kill events; DRAP and APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) fines
  under Decreto-Lei n.º 147/2008 for environmental damage can reach €100,000+
- EPDM as insurance against this liability: the membrane cost is modest relative to the
  environmental and regulatory exposure

## Section 7: EPDM vs Polyethylene / Concrete / Epoxy

**Purpose:** Objective, data-driven comparison to help the farmer make an informed decision
without overselling or misrepresenting alternatives.

**Content:** Comparison table with 6 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | Bare Concrete | Epoxy Coating | HDPE Liner | PVC Liner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lactic acid resistance | Excellent — 50+ years | Poor — degrades in 15–20 yrs | Good — 8–15 yrs | Good — 25–30 yrs | Moderate — plasticiser loss |
| Crack bridging | Excellent — 400% elongation | N/A — is the substrate | None — rigid film | Limited — 12–15% elongation | Moderate — 200% elongation |
| Tractor traffic (floor) | Yes — 2.0 mm grade | Yes (but acid attack) | Limited | Yes with protection | Not recommended |
| Silage inertness | Confirmed — no migration | Variable (lime migration) | Good when intact | Good | Risk — plasticisers |
| Leachate containment | Excellent | Poor — porous, cracks | Good when intact | Excellent | Good |
| 30-year total cost index | 100 | 180 (rebuild/repair) | 160 (3 reapplications) | 115 | 130 |

Honest acknowledgement: HDPE is a technically sound alternative for new silo bases where the
subbase is uniform and tractor traffic can be managed; its limitation is seam vulnerability and
brittleness at low temperatures. Epoxy is appropriate as a stop-gap for moderate acid environments.
Membriko recommends EPDM as the long-term solution for full-perimeter silo lining where structural
movement, temperature cycling and irregular geometries are all factors.

## Section 8: Feed Safety — No Toxic Migration from EPDM

**Purpose:** Directly address the concern that EPDM might contaminate silage and harm animals
or compromise organic certification.

**Content:**
- EPDM composition: no plasticisers, no phthalates, no heavy metal stabilisers (lead, cadmium,
  tin); carbon black filler chemically bound and non-extractable
- Regulatory basis: EU General Feed Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002); Feed Hygiene Regulation
  (183/2005); no migration of harmful compounds from EPDM at silage-contact conditions
- Organic farming: principal European organic certifiers (Ecocert, CERES, CCPB) have accepted
  EPDM in silage storage where no other suitable inert material is available; farm advisers
  should confirm with their certifier before installation
- Contrast with PVC: PVC silage liners contain 20–40% plasticisers by weight; some plasticiser
  migration into silage at fermentation temperatures (40–70°C) cannot be excluded; EPDM has
  no plasticiser to migrate
- Membriko uses only EPDM formulations from manufacturers with documented feed safety data
  sheets (MSDS) confirming compliance with EU feed contact standards

## Section 9: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Complete data table for farm consultants, architects and DRAP inspectors reviewing
the farm's engineering documentation.

**Content:** Full technical data table.

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness — walls | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness — floor (trafficked) | 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |

## Section 10: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that EPDM silo lining requires minimal maintenance compared to alternatives.

**Content:**
- Annual inspection: visual check of wall anchor bar and top seal before each filling season;
  check of wall-to-floor junction cove; check of drain flange seal
- Cleaning: EPDM surface can be washed with water jet (up to 120 bar) between silage cycles;
  no chemical cleaning agents required; biological contamination (mould) can be removed with
  dilute hypochlorite wash
- Repair: EPDM patches can be bonded to repair accidental punctures; a repair patch requires
  dry conditions and EPDM contact adhesive; typical repair time 2–4 hours for a single point
  damage; Membriko maintains a repair callout service within 48 hours under the warranty period
- What to avoid: dragging sharp metal objects (old machinery) across the floor membrane; dropping
  heavy metal equipment onto the membrane; using high-pressure lance at close range on the
  wall anchor seal

## Section 11: Portuguese Agricultural Context

**Purpose:** Demonstrate Membriko's understanding of Portuguese farming conditions and the
specific regional contexts where silage storage is critical.

**Content:** Three regional cards.

**Minho and Entre Douro e Vouga (Dairy)**
- Largest concentration of intensive dairy production in Portugal; high annual rainfall supports
  intensive grass and maize silage production; farms typically operate 2–4 bunker silos in
  continuous rotation; high water table and proximity to river systems makes leachate containment
  critical

**Interior Alentejo and Beja (Beef and Mixed)**
- Extensive beef cattle farming; seasonal silage production (predominantly maize) for dry season
  supplementation; silo infrastructure often older (1980s–90s) and requiring rehabilitation;
  clay soils with seasonal water table fluctuation create movement risks for rigid coatings

**Beira Alta and Trás-os-Montes (Mountain Farming)**
- Harsh winters with sub-zero temperatures; EPDM's flexibility at -45°C ensures the membrane
  does not embrittle during winter freeze/thaw cycles that damage rigid coatings; altitude and
  slope create drainage challenges that EPDM's flexibility handles where rigid systems fail

---

## Section 12: Environmental Regulations

**Purpose:** Position Membriko as a trusted adviser on the regulatory landscape, not just
a product supplier.

**Content:**
- Decreto-Lei n.º 81/2013 (REAP): legal basis for effluent containment requirements on Portuguese
  livestock farms; definitions of effluent types and storage capacity obligations
- Plano de Gestão de Efluentes (PGE): documentation that Membriko's installation report and
  warranty certificate directly support in the PGE compliance file
- Diretiva Nitratos and Zonas Vulneráveis: heightened requirements in designated nitrate vulnerable
  zones; map of Portuguese NVZs by river basin; EPDM lining as a compliance measure
- APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) inspection regime: what inspectors look for in silage
  storage; how to demonstrate containment integrity; the role of third-party installation
  certification
- Organic farming certification: which certifying bodies accept EPDM in silage contact; how to
  include EPDM installation documentation in the organic certification file

---

## Section 13: Cost-Benefit Analysis for Farmers

**Purpose:** Frame the investment decision in terms farmers understand: cost per tonne of
silage stored, payback period, and avoided liability.

**Content:**
- Typical Membriko installation costs (indicative ranges):
  - Small bunker silo (15 m × 6 m, 90 m²): €4,500–€7,500
  - Medium bunker silo (30 m × 8 m, 240 m²): €9,000–€15,000
  - Large bunker silo complex (60 m × 12 m, 720 m²): €22,000–€35,000
- Amortised over 15-year warranty period and 50-year service life: cost per year is negligible
  relative to farm revenue
- Avoided costs: concrete rehabilitation (€15,000–€40,000 per silo per rebuild cycle); DRAP
  fine for effluent release (up to €100,000); silage quality losses from poor containment (€5–€15
  per tonne of DM for contaminated silage)
- Energy cost of silage losses: poorly sealed silos produce aerobic spoilage; 5–10% DM loss
  per cycle on an unlined 500-tonne silo = 25–50 tonnes lost = €3,000–€6,000 per year at
  €120/tonne DM value; improved anaerobic conditions from sealed walls reduce these losses

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and pre-sell FAQ objections specific to silage
storage applications.

1. **O EPDM resiste ao ácido láctico da silagem durante 50 anos?**
   Yes — EPDM shows no measurable degradation after laboratory immersion equivalent to 25+ years
   of continuous lactic acid contact at pH 3. Long-term field performance in bunker silos in
   Northern and Central Europe (where EPDM has been used for silo lining since the 1980s) confirms
   this laboratory data in practice.

2. **Posso continuar a usar o silo durante a instalação da membrana EPDM?**
   No — the silo must be empty and cleaned during installation. Membriko plans installations for
   between silage cycles, typically in April–June or October–November when silos are emptied.
   For farms with multiple silos, work can be sequenced to keep some capacity operational.

3. **É necessária licença ou aprovação para instalar membrana EPDM num silo existente?**
   No specific licence is required for membrane installation in an existing silo. The installation
   improves the silo's compliance with REAP requirements. The Membriko installation report can
   be included in the farm's PGE compliance documentation and presented to DRAP inspectors.

4. **O EPDM é aprovado para silos de exploração agrícola biológica?**
   EPDM has been accepted by major European organic certification bodies for silage storage contact,
   given its demonstrated inertness and absence of plasticisers. Farmers should confirm with their
   specific certifier (e.g. Biocert, Ecocert, SGS) before installation; Membriko provides a
   material data sheet confirming EPDM composition for submission to the certifier.

5. **Qual a espessura correcta de EPDM para o pavimento do silo onde circulam tractores?**
   Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for trafficked silo floors, compared with 1.5 mm for walls.
   The 2.0 mm grade provides adequate puncture and abrasion resistance for tractor and loading
   shovel traffic during filling and unloading operations. A 300 g/m² geotextile underlayer is
   also installed where the concrete subbase has surface irregularities.

6. **O EPDM pode ser instalado sobre betão antigo com fissuras?**
   Yes — this is one of EPDM's principal advantages. The 400%+ elongation allows the membrane
   to bridge existing concrete cracks without transmitting stress to the membrane. Cracks wider
   than 5 mm should be filled with flexible mortar before membrane installation; cracks under
   5 mm can be bridged by the membrane directly. Membriko assesses crack condition during the
   site visit and specifies pre-treatment where required.

7. **Como funciona o sistema de recolha de lixiviado com membrana EPDM?**
   The EPDM floor membrane is installed with a slope of 1–2% towards a central or front drain
   point. A flanged EPDM drain fitting is sealed to the membrane at this point and connected to
   the farm's leachate collection tank. The collection tank must be sized according to REAP
   requirements (typically 90 days storage capacity). Membriko can advise on tank sizing and
   connection detail.

8. **Quanto tempo dura uma instalação típica em silo de trincheira?**
   A standard single bunker silo (30 m × 8 m, floor + two walls, approximately 280 m²) is
   completed in 3–4 days by a Membriko installation team. Larger or more complex installations
   (multiple silos, pit form) take 5–7 days. The silo can be filled within 24 hours of installation
   completion, without any curing wait time.
