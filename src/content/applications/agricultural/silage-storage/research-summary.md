# Silage Storage — EPDM Research Summary

## Silage Biochemistry and the Lining Challenge

Silage is preserved forage produced by the anaerobic fermentation of green plant material —
principally maize (corn), grass, whole-crop cereals, and legumes. The preservation mechanism is
lactic acid fermentation: naturally occurring Lactobacillus bacteria convert water-soluble
carbohydrates in the crop into lactic acid, reducing the pH of the silage mass from approximately
6.5 at ensiling to a stable preservation pH of 3.5–4.5 within 3–6 weeks.

The acidity of well-fermented silage is comparable to vinegar (pH 2.4) or lemon juice (pH 2.0)
though typically slightly higher due to buffering by plant proteins. The fermentation also produces
subsidiary acids — acetic acid (vinegar acid), propionic acid, and butyric acid in variable
proportions depending on fermentation quality. A well-sealed, rapidly fermented silage will be
predominantly lactic acid (60–70%) with minimal butyric acid (an indicator of poor fermentation).
Poorly sealed or slowly fermented silage produces higher butyric acid proportions with associated
nutritional loss and odour problems.

Key lining chemistry challenge: a silage storage structure must withstand continuous or intermittent
contact with an aqueous acid mixture at pH 3.5–4.5 (dropping to pH 3.0 in the leachate concentrated
at the base of the structure) across a temperature range of approximately 5°C (winter ambient) to
70°C (internal temperature during active fermentation, which generates significant heat).

## Silage Effluent (Leachate): Composition and Volume

Silage leachate is the liquid expelled from the silage mass under the combined effects of:
1. High moisture content of the ensiled crop (above 25–30% dry matter)
2. Physical compression of the crop by tractors during filling or by a weighted cover
3. Osmotic pressure from the high acid concentration

Leachate composition is highly variable but typically contains:
- Lactic acid and volatile fatty acids: 3,000–15,000 mg/L COD (chemical oxygen demand)
- Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5): 10,000–70,000 mg/L (compare: raw municipal sewage ~300 mg/L)
- Total nitrogen: 200–1,500 mg/L (predominantly organic-N and ammonium-N)
- pH: 3.0–4.5 at source

This exceptional biological oxygen demand means that even small volumes of leachate reaching
surface water or groundwater have severely damaging environmental consequences. Silage leachate
has been identified as one of the most potent agricultural water pollutants per unit volume.

Leachate volumes depend primarily on crop moisture content:
- Wilted silage (30–35% DM): negligible leachate
- Standard silage (20–25% DM): 50–100 litres per tonne of crop ensiled
- High-moisture silage (15–20% DM, e.g. early-cut grass): 200–300 litres per tonne

A Portuguese dairy farm ensiling 500 tonnes of maize silage at 20% DM will generate 25,000–50,000
litres of leachate per ensiling cycle. This leachate requires complete containment.

## EPDM Chemical Resistance to Silage Acids

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) exhibits outstanding resistance to the full range of organic
acids present in silage leachate, by virtue of its saturated polymer backbone:

**Lactic acid resistance:**
Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) at concentrations up to 10% w/v causes no measurable
change in EPDM hardness, tensile strength or elongation after extended immersion (ASTM D471 method,
168 hours at 70°C, representing approximately 25 years of ambient-temperature service via Arrhenius
projection). This is the most critical acid for silage liner performance.

**Acetic acid resistance:**
EPDM shows excellent resistance to acetic acid at concentrations encountered in silage leachate
(typically 0.5–3% w/v). At higher laboratory test concentrations (10% acetic acid, 70°C), marginal
swelling of 2–5% by volume is observed — within acceptable service limits.

**Propionic and butyric acid resistance:**
EPDM is resistant to propionic acid (a feed preservative also produced in silage) and butyric acid
(a marker of poor fermentation). No structural degradation at silage-relevant concentrations.

**Comparative acid resistance (pH 3–5):**
| Material | Lactic acid resistance | Acetic acid resistance | Service life assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| EPDM | Excellent | Excellent | 50+ years |
| Concrete (unprotected) | Poor — surface carbonation and erosion | Poor — leaches calcium | 15–20 years (with deterioration) |
| Epoxy coating (concrete) | Good initially | Good initially | 8–15 years (micro-cracking) |
| HDPE liner | Good | Good | 20–30 years |
| PVC liner | Moderate | Moderate — plasticiser extraction | 10–15 years |
| Polypropylene | Good | Good | 20–30 years |

EPDM's key advantages over HDPE and polypropylene in silo applications:
- Elongation of 400%+ vs HDPE at 12–15%: EPDM accommodates substrate movement and thermal cycling
  without stress cracking
- Seamability: EPDM seams are vulcanised (chemically fused), creating bonds equivalent in strength
  to the parent membrane; HDPE seams are heat-welded and can be stress points
- Flexibility at low temperature: EPDM remains flexible to -45°C vs HDPE becoming brittle below -15°C

## Silage Storage Structure Types

### Bunker Silos (Silos de Trincheira)
Bunker silos are the most common intensive silage storage type on Portuguese dairy and beef farms.
They consist of three-sided concrete structures open at the front and top:
- Two parallel concrete walls (typically 2.5–4.0 m high, 20–60 m long)
- A concrete floor (with 1–2% slope to leachate drain at the front)
- Open top covered with plastic film weighted by tyres or purpose-made weights
- Open front face for loading and unloading

Concrete is attacked by silage acids at all surfaces in contact with the silage mass or leachate.
EPDM membrane applied to the floor and walls creates a complete chemical barrier. The floor EPDM
must be installed with appropriate thickness (1.5 mm minimum) to resist damage from tractor traffic
during filling; 2.0 mm is specified for high-traffic bunker floors.

### Clamp Silos (Silos de Pilha)
Clamp silos are farm-scale silage piles on prepared concrete bases without permanent side walls.
They are lower in capital cost but less efficient in terms of leachate containment and sealing.
EPDM membrane applied to the base slab contains the leachate; temporary wall boards or earth
banks confine the silage laterally. The membrane is carried up the temporary walls and anchored
to prevent leachate escape under the walls.

### Silage Pits (Silos de Fossa)
Below-ground silage storage: excavated pits lined with EPDM on all surfaces. Less common in
Portugal but used on farms with shallow rock or unstable terrain. The pit form offers natural
temperature stability but requires careful EPDM installation on slopes and corners.

### Tower Silos (Silos de Torre)
Vertical cylindrical silos, traditionally concrete stave construction. Less common for grass and
maize silage in Portugal; more associated with grain storage. EPDM internal lining is used for
rehabilitation of deteriorated stave silos.

## Regulatory Context: Portuguese Agricultural Effluent Law

Portugal has specific legislation governing silage leachate containment:

**Decreto-Lei n.º 81/2013, de 14 de junho (Regime do Exercício da Atividade Pecuária — REAP)**
This is the primary regulation for Portuguese livestock operations. It establishes requirements
for effluent storage capacity, including silage leachate, as a function of farm size and local
sensitive receptor risk. Key provisions:
- Effluent storage must provide capacity for the period when land spreading is prohibited (typically
  November–January and during wet weather)
- Storage structures must be constructed to prevent leakage to soil or water bodies
- Silage leachate is classified as a Type III agricultural effluent (high BOD, requiring containment)

**Plano de Gestão de Efluentes (PGE)**
Farms above specified size thresholds require a formal effluent management plan (PGE) approved
by the Direcção Regional de Agricultura e Pescas (DRAP). The plan must demonstrate that leachate
storage capacity is adequate and that the containment structure is watertight. A Membriko-installed
EPDM lining with 15-year warranty documentation supports PGE approval.

**Diretiva Nitratos (91/676/CEE) — Portuguese Implementation**
Portugal implemented the EU Nitrates Directive in Portaria n.º 259/2012. While primarily targeting
nitrogen from livestock effluents, its application to silage leachate (as a nitrogen-containing
effluent) is relevant in Nitrates Vulnerable Zones (Zonas Vulneráveis), particularly in river
basin areas of the Tejo, Douro and Cávado.

**Environmental licensing (Licença Ambiental / PCIP)**
Large intensive livestock operations require an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)
licence under Decreto-Lei n.º 127/2013. Environmental compliance at inspection includes verification
of silage storage integrity. EPDM-lined silos with documented testing records provide clear
compliance evidence.

## Feed Quality and EPDM Inertness

The fundamental requirement for any silage contact material is that it must not migrate substances
into the silage that affect animal health or product quality. This is particularly relevant for
dairy operations where silage composition directly affects milk composition, and for organic farms
where input restrictions apply.

EPDM's suitability for silage contact is established by its chemical composition and inertness:
- No plasticisers: EPDM contains no phthalate or other plasticisers (unlike PVC-based liners)
- No heavy metal stabilisers: modern EPDM formulations are free of lead, cadmium and tin stabilisers
- Sulphur vulcanisation by-products: present at trace levels in the membrane; not extractable into
  silage acid environment at concentrations of concern for animal nutrition
- Carbon black filler: chemically inert, bound into the polymer matrix, not extractable

Regulatory basis in Portugal for feed contact materials: Regulamento (CE) n.º 1935/2004 (materials
in contact with food) does not explicitly cover silage storage liners (silage is intermediate
feed, not food for human consumption). The applicable framework is the General Feed Law (Regulation
(EC) No 178/2002) and the hygiene of feed materials (Regulation (EC) No 183/2005). EPDM meets
the requirements of these frameworks for silage contact applications.

For organic farming (Certificação Biológica under EU Regulation 2018/848), the acceptability of
EPDM in contact with organic silage depends on the certifying body; the principal European organic
certifiers have accepted EPDM membrane in silage silos given its demonstrated inertness.

## Key Performance Data

**Temperature resistance during fermentation:**
Active silage fermentation generates metabolic heat. Internal silage temperatures during the first
2–6 weeks can reach 40–70°C, particularly in large bunker silos with imperfect anaerobic conditions.
EPDM service temperature range of -45°C to +130°C (continuous) comfortably exceeds all conditions
encountered in silage storage. Thermal cycling between winter (ambient -5°C in northern Portugal)
and fermentation peak temperatures creates no mechanical stress in EPDM due to its low modulus
and high elongation.

**Tractor traffic resistance:**
EPDM at 2.0 mm installed over a smooth concrete substrate withstands normal tractor and loading
shovel (pá carregadora) traffic during silo filling and unloading. Best practice specifies:
- 1.5 mm EPDM for walls (no tractor traffic)
- 2.0 mm EPDM for floor (tractor and machinery traffic)
- Geotextile protection layer (300 g/m²) under floor EPDM where subbase is irregular

**Elongation and structural movement:**
Concrete silo structures are subject to thermal movement, initial settlement, and seasonal soil
movement. Bunker silo walls of 30 m length experience approximately 12–18 mm of thermal expansion/
contraction annually. EPDM with 400%+ elongation absorbs this movement without stress at seams
or bonds. Rigid coatings (epoxy, polyurethane) develop micro-cracks at construction joints under
the same movement regime.

**Weld / seam performance:**
EPDM seams vulcanised with QuickSeam tape or liquid contact adhesive achieve:
- Peel strength: ≥ 0.6 N/mm (EN 12316-2)
- Shear strength: ≥ 0.8 N/mm (EN 12317-2)
- These values are maintained after immersion in lactic acid solution at pH 3.5 for 1,000 hours
  (no strength reduction observed in Membriko supplier test data)
