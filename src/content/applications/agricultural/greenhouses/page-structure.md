# Greenhouses (Estufas) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The greenhouse waterproofing page must serve a commercially specific audience: Portuguese
horticultural producers who make investment decisions based on production cost, regulatory
compliance, water management efficiency, and crop protection. This is not a general consumer
audience — it is an audience of agricultural professionals who will respond to technical precision,
sector-specific knowledge, and credible references to Portuguese agricultural reality.

The persuasion architecture follows the producer's logic: first establish the production and
regulatory context that creates the need for serious waterproofing infrastructure (water scarcity,
NVZ compliance, organic certification, crop protection), then establish EPDM as the material that
addresses all of these requirements simultaneously, then walk through the specific greenhouse
applications (floor, gutters, collection, cisterns), then address the specific greenhouse types
found in Portugal (tunnel, multi-span, glass), then provide the comparative and technical data
needed to justify the investment decision, then close with the regulatory framework and Membriko's
process and warranty. FAQs capture the specific pre-sales questions that greenhouse operators ask
before commissioning a waterproofing installation.

The Algarve and Oeste horticulture regions, and the growing Alentejo Litoral sector, are named
explicitly as contexts because this regional specificity builds credibility with producers who
identify strongly with their production zone.

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Protected Horticulture and the Waterproofing Imperative

**Purpose:** Establish the production context and make the waterproofing need feel immediate
and economically motivated.

**Content:**
- Open with the scale and economic significance of Portuguese protected horticulture: 14,000+ ha
  of protected cultivation; Algarve, Oeste, and Alentejo Litoral as production centres; tomato,
  pepper, cucumber, strawberry, and ornamentals as primary crops
- The water management challenge: drought conditions, rising irrigation costs, NVZ compliance
  requirements, and the increasing requirement for closed-loop water systems in intensive production
- The structural challenge: floor containment, gutter waterproofing, and cistern lining are not
  optional upgrades in a modern greenhouse — they are production infrastructure without which
  regulatory compliance and water efficiency targets cannot be met
- The Membriko answer: EPDM membrane is the only material that provides the chemical inertness,
  root resistance, UV stability, and long service life that greenhouse waterproofing demands
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / 400% elongation / Zero plasticisers / 20-year warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Avaliação Técnica"

---

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Greenhouses

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — establish why EPDM is specifically suited to the greenhouse
environment, not just a generic waterproofing material.

**Content:**
- The four stresses that eliminate most materials from greenhouse applications: agrochemical
  exposure, root contact, humidity and condensation, UV at perimeter zones
- EPDM's saturated backbone: no reactive sites for agrochemicals to attack; no plasticiser to
  leach into irrigation water or growing media
- Root resistance: FLL test / EN 13948 certification — the same test standard used for green
  roof root barriers
- UV stability: 5,000-hour xenon arc weathering test; no cracking or chalking
- Elongation: 400% elongation accommodates substrate settlement, thermal movement, and the
  differential movement at structural penetrations without stress cracking

**Physical data table:**

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (floor) | 1.0-1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (gutters / cisterns) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Root resistance | Pass | EN 13948 / FLL |
| UV resistance | No degradation at 5,000 hrs | EN ISO 4892-3 |
| Temperature range | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| Agrochemical resistance | Full range tested | ASTM D471 / ISO 175 |
| Water contact | No plasticiser migration | ACS / WRAS certif. |
| Service life | 50+ years | Industry field data |

## Section 3: Greenhouse Types — Tunnel, Multi-Span, and Glass Houses

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko understands the specific structural and operational
characteristics of each greenhouse type in Portugal, and that EPDM applies appropriately to all.

**Content:** Three greenhouse type cards.

**Single-Span Tunnel Greenhouses (Estufas de Túnel)**
- Context: the most common structure in Portugal; steel hoops 4-8 m span, PE film cover;
  foundation strips and floor drainage as primary waterproofing locations
- EPDM applications: foundation apron, perimeter collection gutter lining, floor containment
  membrane where NVZ compliance requires it
- Note on film compatibility: EPDM is not a replacement for the PE covering film — it
  waterproofs the structural elements and containment systems that the film cannot address

**Multi-Span Greenhouse Complexes (Complexos Multispan)**
- Context: industrial-scale structures of 1-10 hectares; continuous gutter system between spans;
  prevalent in Algarve and Oeste; high-value crop production with significant water reuse systems
- EPDM applications: continuous gutter lining across all spans; perimeter collection channel;
  underground cistern or open reservoir lining; floor containment in production bays
- Scale note: the continuous gutter system in a 3-hectare multi-span complex can exceed 2,000
  linear metres — EPDM's welded seam system provides monolithic watertight construction
  regardless of length

**Glass Greenhouses (Estufas de Vidro)**
- Context: high-value research, ornamental production, and premium year-round horticulture;
  concrete floor and gutter systems standard; higher UV transmission to perimeter areas
- EPDM applications: concrete floor waterproofing; gutter and drainage channel lining; cistern
  and sump waterproofing; roof drainage collection
- Compatibility note: EPDM membrane can be installed under concrete pavers or growing bed
  structures without compression limitation

---

## Section 4: Floor Waterproofing and Containment

**Purpose:** Address the floor containment application as the most structurally significant
and regulatory-driven element of greenhouse waterproofing.

**Content:**
- Two functions of greenhouse floor waterproofing: nutrient containment (NVZ compliance) and
  groundwater exclusion (high water table areas)
- Installation sequence: sub-base preparation; blinding layer (sand or lean concrete); EPDM
  membrane laid in single sheets; overlap seams taped and bonded; perimeter upstand to
  foundation wall; collection drain penetrations through flanged EPDM accessories
- Thickness and specification: 1.0 mm for standard containment; 1.5 mm where groundwater
  pressure or heavy traffic (fork-lift access) applies
- Drainage integration: perimeter collection drain in EPDM-lined channel connects to cistern
  or balancing tank; design allows monitoring and metering of drainage volumes for regulatory
  reporting
- Protection layers: geotextile fleece on top of membrane protects against mechanical damage
  from foot traffic and growing media installation; can be walked on immediately after
  geotextile installation

---

## Section 5: Irrigation Water Collection — Gutters, Channels, and Cisterns

**Purpose:** Position EPDM as the material of choice for the water collection infrastructure
that greenhouse operators are investing in to meet water efficiency targets.

**Content:**
- The economic case for water collection: collected condensate and roof drainage at €0.80-1.20/m³
  mains water replacement value; a 1 ha multi-span collecting 400-600 m³/year saves €320-720/year
  in water cost, plus the regulatory benefit of reduced mains abstraction
- Gutter lining: EPDM in continuous sheet conforms to any gutter section profile; no joints
  required within a gutter run; seamed only at gutter-to-downpipe connections and expansion joints
- Collection channel: perimeter channel linking all gutter downpipes to cistern; EPDM-lined
  cast-in-place concrete channel or formed EPDM channel on earth sub-base
- Underground cisterns: single EPDM sheet welded to cistern dimensions; no seams in cisterns
  up to 15.25 m wide; flanged penetrations for inlets, outlets, overflow and access hatches
- Chemical neutrality: collected water used for direct irrigation of crops — EPDM releases no
  plasticisers, biocides, or heavy metals into stored water; compatible with organic certification

## Section 6: Installation Process (7 Steps)

**Purpose:** Make the installation process predictable and professional; reduce perceived risk
of commissioning a complex agricultural waterproofing project.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Visita Técnica e Levantamento** — On-site survey of greenhouse structure, floor area,
   gutter system, existing drainage, and collection points; measurement for membrane quantity;
   assessment of substrate condition and preparation requirements; identification of all
   penetration points (downpipes, drains, columns, ventilation ducts)
2. **Projecto de Impermeabilização** — Membrane layout plan specifying sheet widths, seam
   positions, penetration details, perimeter termination, and connection details between
   floor, gutter, and cistern elements; material take-off and specification; programme
   schedule minimising disruption to production
3. **Preparação de Substrato** — Concrete repair on gutters and floors; sub-base compaction
   verification for earthwork areas; grinding of sharp edges and protrusions; cleaning
   and degreasing of concrete surfaces; installation of perimeter drain formwork where required
4. **Instalação de Membrana** — Membrane laid from roll and positioned; full-surface adhesive
   bonding on concrete substrates; loose-lay with geotextile protection on earthwork substrates;
   perimeter upstands formed and secured to wall or foundation with termination bar
5. **Emendas e Pontos Singulares** — Overlap seams bonded with QuickSeam tape and primer;
   penetration sleeves for all downpipes, column bases, and drain connections using flanged
   EPDM accessories; inside and outside corners formed with pre-cut EPDM patches
6. **Sistemas de Drenagem e Recolha** — EPDM collection channel and cistern lining; connection
   of gutter membrane to cistern; inlet, outlet, overflow, and access penetrations sealed with
   flanged compression fittings; hydraulic testing of cistern before backfill where applicable
7. **Inspecção, Teste e Documentação** — Visual inspection of all seams and details; water test
   of all drainage channels and cistern; electronic leak detection where concealed elements
   require it; delivery of as-built documentation, membrane certification sheets, and
   20-year Membriko installation warranty

## Section 7: EPDM vs Polyethylene Film, HDPE, Concrete, and Bitumen

**Purpose:** Provide the objective comparison data that producers need to justify the investment
in EPDM over lower-cost alternatives.

**Content:** Comparison table with 6 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | PE Ground Film | HDPE Geomembrane | Cement Coating | Bitumen |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 1-4 years | 20-30 years | 5-15 years | 10-20 years |
| Agrochemical resistance | Excellent | Good | Good | Moderate | Poor |
| Root resistance | Excellent (EN 13948) | Poor | Moderate | N/A | Moderate |
| Watertight containment | Yes — full | No — partial | Yes | Yes (if uncracked) | Yes (if uncracked) |
| Crack bridging | Excellent — 400% | N/A | Moderate | None | None |
| Organic certification compat. | Yes | Conditional | Conditional | Yes | No |

Honest acknowledgement: HDPE geomembrane is a technically acceptable choice for large flat
cisterns and reservoirs where the seaming can be carried out by a thermowelding specialist.
For the complex geometries, penetration details, and small-scale elements (gutters, channels,
floor perimeters) typical of greenhouse installations, EPDM's cold-bonded seaming system and
higher flexibility provide significant installation and long-term performance advantages.

## Section 8: Humidity and Condensation Management

**Purpose:** Address the specific condensation challenge in greenhouse environments that many
waterproofing contractors do not understand.

**Content:**
- Condensation physics in greenhouses: warm, humid interior air meets cold structure and
  covering; condensate volume calculation example for a 1 ha multi-span at typical
  winter conditions
- Gutter design for condensation: continuous eaves gutter at 2-4% fall; EPDM lining of
  aluminium or steel gutter sections with pre-formed internal corners and outlet details
- Foundation corrosion protection: EPDM apron membrane at base of columns and perimeter
  walls prevents condensate pooling at the most vulnerable corrosion location; extend 300 mm
  above and below ground level on all steel foundation connections
- Floor drainage design: floor graded at 0.5-1.0% to perimeter collection drain; EPDM
  floor membrane installed below geotextile protection to maintain drainage while providing
  containment
- Interior condensation vs. exterior rainwater: differentiated collection where possible
  for water quality management (interior condensate is cleaner than exterior runoff)

## Section 9: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Provide the complete data table for agronomists, agricultural engineers, and
subsidy application documentation.

**Content:** Full technical data table.

| Property | Value | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (floor, standard) | 1.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (floor, high load) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |

| Service life | 50+ years | Industry field data |

---

## Section 10: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that EPDM greenhouse waterproofing requires minimal ongoing
maintenance; reinforce total cost of ownership argument.

**Content:**
- Annual maintenance: visual inspection of seam lines and perimeter terminations; check
  that perimeter upstands are not displaced by growing bed movement or fork-lift contact;
  check drain penetrations for root intrusion or blockage
- Gutter maintenance: standard gutter cleaning schedule (twice yearly minimum) removes debris
  that could accumulate and cause water to overflow the membrane rather than a membrane defect
- Floor membrane: geotextile protection layer replaces EPDM inspection as the routine
  maintenance focus; if geotextile is torn or displaced, inspect EPDM beneath before damage
  from traffic
- Repair procedure: EPDM patches bonded with primer and QuickSeam tape; most repairs
  completable in under 2 hours without draining or production disruption; permanent repair
  documented and included in warranty record
- Chemical cleaning: standard greenhouse disinfection protocols (hydrogen peroxide, peracetic
  acid, sodium hypochlorite) compatible with EPDM — no membrane protection required during
  routine greenhouse sterilisation
- Membriko inspection offer: on-site technical inspection available at 5 years and 10 years
  post-installation; inspection report provided as maintenance record for subsidy audit trail

## Section 11: The Portuguese Greenhouse Sector — Algarve, Oeste, and Alentejo Litoral

**Purpose:** Demonstrate deep understanding of the regional production context; build credibility
with producers who identify strongly with their growing region.

**Content:**
- **Algarve:** 3,000+ ha of protected horticulture concentrated in the Barlavento and Sotavento
  coastal plains; primary crops tomato, pepper, cucumber; water scarcity is the defining
  production constraint; municipal water at premium cost; investment in EPDM-lined cisterns
  and collection systems driven by the 2022 drought; DRAP Algarve actively promotes water
  efficiency investment eligible for subsidy
- **Oeste (Estremadura):** The highest concentration of tunnel greenhouse production in mainland
  Portugal; Torres Vedras, Caldas da Rainha, and Óbidos municipalities; strawberry, tomato,
  lettuce, ornamentals; NVZ designation of the Tejo estuary catchment creates compliance
  pressure for floor containment; proximity to Lisbon creates labour and service access
  advantages; Membriko's base in Pombal places the region within operational reach
- **Alentejo Litoral:** Fastest-growing production zone; large-scale berry production
  (strawberry, blueberry) by major Portuguese and international operators; very high levels
  of investment in CEA (Controlled Environment Agriculture); new facilities being built with
  full waterproofing specification from the outset; strong demand for cistern and reservoir
  lining as part of water management infrastructure
- **Ribatejo and Centro:** Mixed horticulture and floriculture; older greenhouse stock requiring
  retrofit waterproofing; smaller-scale producers for whom Membriko's Pombal base offers
  practical proximity

---

## Section 12: Regulations — DRAP, APA, Nitrates Directive, Organic Farming

**Purpose:** Provide the regulatory certainty that professional greenhouse operators need;
position EPDM documentation as evidence for subsidy applications and inspection compliance.

**Content:**
- **EU Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) and Portuguese NVZ designation:** Operators in Nitrate
  Vulnerable Zones (Zonas Vulneráveis aos Nitratos) must demonstrate containment of nutrient
  leaching; EPDM floor membrane with collection drain system provides documentable compliance
  infrastructure; DRAP inspectors recognise certified membrane installation as satisfactory
  evidence of containment intent
- **Decreto-Lei 235/97 and Portaria 259/2012:** Portuguese implementation of the Nitrates
  Directive; Good Agricultural Practice codes require nutrient management plans for intensive
  greenhouse operations; physical containment infrastructure supports compliance
- **APA water quality requirements:** Installations near surface water bodies or in water
  protection zones may require environmental licencing that includes demonstration of runoff
  and nutrient containment — EPDM installation documentation provides the evidence
- **EU Organic Regulation 2018/848:** EPDM does not introduce prohibited substances;
  compatible with certified organic production; Ecocert and CERTIS do not identify EPDM
  as a prohibited material
- **PDR2020 / PT2030 subsidy documentation:** Rural development programme subsidies for
  greenhouse modernisation and water efficiency investment require documentation of the
  installed systems; Membriko provides membrane certification, installation warranty, and
  as-built documentation suitable for subsidy application files

---

## Section 13: Organic Farming Compatibility

**Purpose:** Address the specific requirements of organic greenhouse producers — a growing
and commercially premium segment of Portuguese horticulture.

**Content:**
- Organic production in Portugal: growing sector driven by export demand (principally Germany,
  Netherlands, UK) and premium domestic market; Alentejo and Algarve as primary organic
  vegetable regions; organic area increasing at approximately 8% per year
- Why membrane material matters in organic production: the EU Organic Regulation requires that
  materials in contact with organic production inputs (water, growing media, soil) do not
  introduce prohibited synthetic substances; this scrutiny extends to waterproofing membranes
  that contact irrigation water or growing media
- EPDM's organic compatibility: no plasticisers (phthalates or adipates are not on the EU
  approved list for organic farming contacts); no organotin or heavy metal stabilisers; no
  synthetic biocides incorporated into the membrane; no organohalogen compounds; ACS/WRAS
  water contact certification demonstrates absence of harmful migration
- Practical guidance: Membriko provides membrane certification documentation and formulation
  data suitable for submission to organic certification bodies; this documentation has
  been accepted by Ecocert France and CERTIS Portugal in previous organic greenhouse projects
- Distinction from HDPE: some HDPE geomembranes contain antioxidant additives that may
  conflict with organic requirements; EPDM's simpler additive package (primarily carbon black
  and sulphur vulcanisation system) is easier to document for organic compliance

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture specific pre-sales questions from greenhouse operators; reduce enquiry
load and demonstrate sector expertise.

1. **A membrana EPDM é compatível com os adubos e fitofármacos usados na minha estufa?**
   Yes. EPDM has documented chemical resistance to the full range of agrochemicals used in
   Portuguese protected horticulture, including NPK fertiliser solutions, chelated micronutrients,
   copper-based fungicides, sulphuric acid at pH-correction concentrations, and quaternary
   ammonium disinfectants used in greenhouse sterilisation. The membrane does not degrade under
   agrochemical contact and does not release contaminants into contact water.

2. **Posso usar a água recolhida nos caleiros e na cisterna EPDM para regar directamente as culturas?**
   Yes. EPDM is certified for contact with water used for human consumption (ACS France, WRAS UK)
   — the standard for irrigation water reuse is less stringent. The absence of plasticisers,
   biocides, and heavy metal stabilisers in EPDM ensures that water stored in EPDM-lined cisterns
   is not contaminated with membrane-derived compounds. Membriko provides the certification
   documentation needed for subsidy applications and regulatory compliance files.

3. **Qual a espessura de EPDM necessária para o pavimento da minha estufa?**
   For standard containment on a prepared sub-base (compacted stone or lean concrete), 1.0 mm
   EPDM with geotextile protection is appropriate. Where the floor must resist fork-lift traffic
   or heavy growing bed infrastructure, 1.5 mm is specified. Cisterns and gutters are typically
   lined with 1.5 mm. Membriko specifies the appropriate thickness after assessing the production
   system and traffic loads at the site visit.

4. **A membrana EPDM resiste às raízes das culturas (tomate, pepino, morango)?**
   Yes. EPDM root resistance is tested and certified under EN 13948 (the European standard for
   root-resistant membranes, originally developed for green roofs where root pressure over decades
   must be resisted). The same resistance applies to greenhouse crops. This certification is
   particularly relevant for floor membranes installed beneath growing beds where high root-pressure
   crops such as tomato and cucumber are cultivated.

5. **Tenho uma estufa multispan com 2 hectares. O EPDM é viável para todo o sistema de caleiros?**
   Yes. Multi-span greenhouse gutter systems are one of the applications where EPDM's advantages
   are most clear: the continuous gutter lining eliminates the joints and junctions that cause
   leaks in aluminium or steel gutters without a membrane; the EPDM seaming system is applied
   cold without specialist equipment; and the membrane can be installed in full production without
   dismantling the gutter structure. Membriko has experience with multi-span systems up to 5
   hectares and provides a detailed project programme to minimise production disruption.

6. **A instalação da membrana obriga a interromper a produção?**
   For gutter lining, installation is carried out from the structure exterior and typically does
   not require production interruption — the interior crop continues normally. For floor
   waterproofing, the area under installation must be cleared of crops and equipment for the
   duration of the work. Membriko programmes floor installations in sections, working with the
   producer's crop rotation schedule to minimise the area out of production at any one time.
   A typical 1 ha floor installation is completed in 5-8 working days.

7. **Quais os documentos que a Membriko fornece para o meu dossier de candidatura PDR2020/PT2030?**
   Membriko delivers: the membrane manufacturer's technical data sheet and CE certification;
   ACS/WRAS water contact certification where applicable; the project as-built drawing showing
   membrane layout, seam positions, and drainage connections; the 20-year installation warranty
   certificate; and a handover report. This documentation package is designed to satisfy
   the requirements of PDR2020 and PT2030 rural development programme subsidy files and DRAP
   inspection records.

8. **A minha estufa está em Zona Vulnerável aos Nitratos. O EPDM resolve o problema de conformidade?**
   An EPDM floor membrane with perimeter collection drain and EPDM-lined cistern provides the
   physical containment infrastructure that demonstrates compliance with the Good Agricultural
   Practice requirements under Portaria 259/2012 (Portugal's NVZ implementation). DRAP inspectors
   recognise certified membrane installation as satisfactory evidence of nutrient containment.
   Membriko provides the installation documentation that becomes part of the farm's environmental
   compliance file. The collection and reuse of drainage water through the EPDM-lined cistern
   further supports compliance with nutrient management plan requirements.
