# EPDM Membrane Waterproofing for Greenhouses

## Section 1: Portuguese Protected Horticulture and the Waterproofing Imperative

Portugal's protected horticulture sector is one of the most productive and commercially significant in Southern Europe. Across more than 14,000 hectares of covered cultivation, Portuguese growers produce tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, courgettes, strawberries, cut flowers, and ornamentals for domestic markets and for export to Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The industry is concentrated in three primary production regions — the Algarve coastal plains, the Oeste municipalities of Torres Vedras, Caldas da Rainha, and Óbidos, and the rapidly expanding Alentejo Litoral around Odemira and Santiago do Cacém — and its continued growth depends on solving two increasingly urgent problems: water scarcity and regulatory compliance.

Water is the defining production constraint across all three regions. The Algarve receives 400 to 600 millimetres of annual rainfall, almost entirely between October and March, leaving the critical summer growing period entirely dependent on stored or abstracted water. The 2022 drought — the most severe recorded in Portugal since systematic measurements began in 1931 — forced many greenhouse operators to accelerate investment in on-site water capture, storage, and reuse infrastructure. Mains irrigation water in the Algarve costs between €0.80 and €1.20 per cubic metre from commercial agricultural supply networks. Every cubic metre of condensation and roof drainage that can be collected and reused instead of purchased represents a direct and measurable reduction in production cost.

Regulatory pressure compounds the economic incentive. Large areas of Portuguese agricultural land — including the Tejo and Sado river basins, the Algarve coastal plain, and extensive areas of the Norte and Centro regions — are designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (Zonas Vulneráveis aos Nitratos) under Portugal's implementation of EU Directive 91/676/EEC. Greenhouse operators in these designated zones are legally required to prevent nutrient leaching from their production facilities into groundwater and surface water bodies. A greenhouse floor through which fertiliser solution percolates freely into the underlying soil is not only an environmental problem — it is a regulatory compliance failure that exposes the operator to inspection penalties, subsidy ineligibility, and, in serious cases, operational restrictions.

The solution to both problems — water efficiency and regulatory compliance — requires the same physical infrastructure: watertight containment systems for greenhouse floors, gutter networks, collection channels, and storage cisterns. And the material that delivers reliable, chemically compatible, long-life watertight containment across all of these applications is EPDM rubber membrane.

Membriko, based in Pombal, Leiria, in the heart of Portugal's Centro region, installs EPDM membrane waterproofing systems in greenhouse facilities of every type and scale — from a single-span polyethylene tunnel of 2,000 square metres to a multi-span production complex of ten hectares. Membriko brings the technical precision, regional knowledge, and installation experience that serious horticultural producers require when specifying waterproofing infrastructure that must perform reliably for fifty years or more.

## Section 2: Why EPDM is the Right Material for Greenhouse Waterproofing

Choosing a waterproofing material for a greenhouse is a fundamentally different decision from choosing a waterproofing material for a building roof or a civil engineering structure. The greenhouse environment imposes a combination of chemical, biological, mechanical, and climatic stresses that eliminates most generic waterproofing materials from consideration — not because they fail immediately, but because they degrade progressively over years of agrochemical contact, root proximity, high humidity, and UV exposure at perimeter zones, creating the kind of slow, invisible failure that is detected only when it is already causing crop or production system damage.

EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) rubber membrane is selected by Membriko for all greenhouse waterproofing applications because its material properties address every one of these stresses simultaneously. This is not a marketing claim — it is a consequence of the polymer chemistry and the physical test data that supports it.

### Agrochemical Resistance

Greenhouse production involves regular and intensive application of agrochemical inputs: NPK fertiliser solutions at concentrations of 1 to 5 grams per litre, chelated micronutrient preparations (iron-EDTA, manganese-EDTA, zinc-EDTA), copper sulphate fungicide solutions, systemic insecticides and acaricides, growth regulators, and sulphuric acid or nitric acid at concentrations of 1 to 5% for irrigation water pH adjustment. In a year-round production system, the cumulative chemical load on any material in contact with greenhouse drainage or irrigation runoff is substantial.

Most flexible waterproofing membranes achieve their flexibility through plasticiser content — phthalate or adipate esters incorporated into PVC or similar polymer matrices. These plasticisers are susceptible to extraction by polar solvents and by the organic compounds present in agricultural chemical formulations. As the plasticiser content decreases over years of agrochemical contact, the membrane becomes progressively stiffer and more brittle, eventually cracking under thermal movement or mechanical stress. The failure is slow and difficult to detect until watertightness is lost.

EPDM contains no plasticisers. Its flexibility derives entirely from the intrinsic architecture of the vulcanised elastomer — the long, saturated carbon-carbon polymer chains that give the material its rubber-like extensibility without any additive that can migrate, deplete, or react with agricultural chemicals. Published resistance data under ASTM D471 and ISO 175 confirms EPDM stability against sulphuric acid, copper sulphate, potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and the full range of agrochemicals found in Portuguese protected horticulture, including the quaternary ammonium disinfectants used in end-of-season greenhouse sterilisation protocols.

### Root Resistance

Any membrane installed at floor level in a greenhouse, or beneath raised growing beds, is in permanent proximity to the root systems of the crops above it. In high-vigour crops such as tomato (which can produce root balls extending three metres laterally in open substrate systems) and cucumber, root pressure on a containment membrane is sustained and progressive. Root penetration is one of the most commonly cited causes of long-term liner failure in agricultural containment systems — and it is particularly insidious because the failure point is typically concealed beneath the growing bed and only becomes apparent when drainage performance deteriorates.

EPDM root resistance is tested and certified under EN 13948, the European standard for root-resistant membranes developed originally for green roof applications where a membrane must resist root penetration across decades of service without any maintenance access to the membrane surface. The test involves direct, sustained root contact under conditions designed to simulate the mechanical and chemical action of living root systems. EPDM membranes supplied and installed by Membriko carry EN 13948 root resistance certification. No greenhouse crop commonly grown in Portugal — including high-vigour species such as tomato, cucumber, and ornamental climbers — can penetrate an EN 13948-compliant EPDM membrane.

### UV Stability at Exposed Locations

The perimeter zones of any greenhouse structure — foundation walls, external gutter channels, perimeter collection channels, and apron areas at column bases — receive direct solar radiation. In Portuguese conditions, the annual cumulative UV dose at ground level ranges from approximately 1,600 kJ/m² in the north to over 2,000 kJ/m² in the Algarve. Materials that rely on UV-absorbing additives for protection experience progressive additive depletion under this radiation load, with cracking and chalking typically appearing within five to fifteen years of installation.

EPDM's UV resistance derives from two structural features that are intrinsic to the material and cannot deplete: the saturated polymer backbone (which contains no carbon-carbon double bonds susceptible to UV-initiated oxidation) and a high loading of carbon black pigment — approximately 40 parts per hundred rubber — which functions as a UV absorber across the full solar spectrum. Accelerated weathering tests to EN ISO 4892-3 (xenon arc, 5,000 hours) on standard EPDM geomembrane show no cracking, no surface chalking, and no significant mechanical property loss. 5,000 hours of accelerated xenon arc exposure is equivalent to approximately 40 to 60 years of outdoor UV exposure in Portuguese conditions. The perimeter zones of a Membriko EPDM installation are as durable as the floor and gutter areas concealed beneath the structure.

### Elongation and Substrate Movement

Greenhouse floors, foundation aprons, and the earthwork substrates under collection channels are not static structures. Concrete floor slabs crack and settle as the substrate beneath them consolidates. In Portugal's clay-heavy soil regions — the Ribatejo, the Estremadura coastal plain, the Alentejo interior — seasonal moisture cycling causes soil shrinkage and swelling that imposes significant movement on any surface-applied membrane. Multi-span greenhouse structures create differential movement at the interface between adjacent structural bays. All of these movements, if the membrane cannot accommodate them, result in stress concentrations that propagate to tears, delamination, or complete loss of containment.

EPDM elongation at break of 400% to 500%, tested to EN 12311-2, means that the membrane can stretch to five times its original length before rupturing. In practical terms, this means that a crack or settlement movement in the underlying substrate — even a crack several millimetres wide — is bridged by the EPDM membrane without creating a stress concentration that would propagate to membrane failure. Rigid systems — cementitious coatings, epoxy liners, bituminous membranes — cannot bridge substrate movement. A crack in the substrate creates an immediate corresponding crack in the rigid coating, and watertightness is lost at the point of substrate movement. Membriko specifies EPDM precisely because this elongation characteristic eliminates the category of failure that affects all rigid and semi-rigid waterproofing systems.

## Section 3: Greenhouse Types — Tunnel, Multi-Span, and Glass Houses

Portugal's greenhouse stock encompasses a wide range of structural typologies, from the simplest low-cost polyethylene tunnels to sophisticated, climate-controlled glass houses with industrial-scale production systems. The waterproofing requirements vary significantly between types, but EPDM membrane addresses all of them. Membriko has installation experience across the full range of greenhouse structures found in Portuguese horticulture.

### Single-Span Tunnel Greenhouses

The single-span polyethylene tunnel — steel hoops of four to eight metres span, covered with single or double-layer polyethylene film in bays of 25 to 50 metres, sitting on a concrete strip or block foundation — is the most common greenhouse structure in Portugal. These are medium-cost structures with film covering lifespans of one to five years and structural lifespans of 20 to 30 years. They are found throughout the Oeste, the Algarve, the Ribatejo, and the growing Alentejo production zones.

The waterproofing requirements in a tunnel greenhouse are concentrated at three locations: the foundation perimeter, where condensation and lateral drainage create chronic moisture at the most vulnerable structural connection points; the eaves gutter or ridge gutter channels, which collect condensation from the inner face of the PE film and must drain reliably to collection points; and the floor, where containment is required in Nitrate Vulnerable Zone-designated areas or where groundwater exclusion is needed.

Membriko installs EPDM membrane aprons at foundation level, protecting galvanised steel column bases and perimeter frame members from the corrosive combination of condensate and soil contact. Gutter channels — whether steel, aluminium, or formed concrete — are lined with EPDM sheet in continuous runs, eliminating the joints and lap connections that corrode and leak in unlined metal gutters. Floor containment membranes are installed at 1.14 mm thickness on a prepared sub-base, with geotextile protection above and perimeter upstands to the foundation walls. For growers upgrading existing tunnel structures, Membriko programmes installation in phases aligned with the crop rotation calendar, minimising the production area out of use at any one time.

### Multi-Span Greenhouse Complexes

Multi-span greenhouse complexes — industrial-scale structures of one to ten hectares, with continuous inter-span gutter systems, prevalent in the Algarve's Barlavento and Sotavento plains and in the intensive production zones of the Oeste — are where the technical advantages of EPDM waterproofing are most clearly demonstrated. These structures represent significant capital investment, and the crop value inside them is proportional to that scale. Waterproofing failure in a multi-span complex — a leaking inter-span gutter that wets the growing floor, a cistern liner that fails and contaminates stored irrigation water, a floor containment system that allows nutrient-laden drainage to percolate to groundwater — has direct and quantifiable consequences for production economics.

The inter-span gutter system of a three-hectare multi-span complex can extend to more than 2,000 linear metres. Maintaining watertightness across that length, through the thermal expansion and contraction cycles of an aluminium or steel structure that can experience a temperature range of -5°C in winter to +60°C at the metal surface in summer, is not achievable with unlined metal gutters or with jointed gutter sections relying on compression seals that harden and fail over time.

Membriko lines multi-span gutter systems with EPDM in continuous sheet runs — one sheet per gutter channel, seamed only at the structural connections where gutter sections meet and at downpipe penetrations. The cold-bonded seaming system (QuickSeam tape and activator primer) creates a monolithic waterproof lining that accommodates the thermal movement of the structure without opening joints. This system can be installed without dismantling the gutter structure, and in most configurations without interrupting crop production in the greenhouse below. Membriko has installation experience in multi-span systems up to five hectares and provides a detailed project programme to every client showing the installation sequence and the expected production impact at each stage.

### Glass Greenhouses

Glass greenhouses — used for high-value ornamental production, research facilities, premium year-round vegetable production, and advanced CEA (Controlled Environment Agriculture) operations — present more complete waterproofing requirements than tunnel or PE-film structures. They typically feature concrete floor slabs as standard, more complex aluminium gutter and drainage systems, and higher levels of investment in the production infrastructure within. The glass covering transmits more solar radiation to perimeter zones than polyethylene film, increasing the UV load on foundation aprons and external collection channels — which reinforces the importance of EPDM's intrinsic UV stability at these locations.

Membriko installs EPDM membrane in glass greenhouse applications across all waterproofing elements: beneath concrete floor slabs or under growing bed systems, in aluminium and steel gutter channels, in drainage sumps and collection pits, and in cisterns and underground water storage tanks. EPDM membrane installed beneath a concrete slab or paving system provides long-life containment that is entirely independent of the structural behaviour of the concrete above it — cracks in the slab do not compromise the waterproofing below. For glass house operators upgrading nutrient containment systems in existing facilities, Membriko designs retrofitted EPDM floor membranes that can be installed under new growing bed systems without requiring full slab removal.

## Section 4: Floor Waterproofing and Nutrient Containment

Greenhouse floor waterproofing serves two distinct and equally important functions that must both be incorporated in any complete design. Failing to address one undermines the value of addressing the other.

### Nutrient Containment and NVZ Compliance

In substrate-based greenhouse production — whether in soil, growing media in raised beds, or growing bags on a concrete floor — applied irrigation water carries dissolved fertiliser compounds that must not be allowed to percolate freely into the underlying soil and ultimately into the groundwater body beneath the site. In Portugal's designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, this is not a guideline — it is a legal requirement. Under Portaria 259/2012 (Portugal's implementation of EU Directive 91/676/EEC Good Agricultural Practice requirements), greenhouse operators in NVZ-designated areas must demonstrate that their facilities incorporate adequate nutrient containment infrastructure.

An EPDM floor membrane with a perimeter collection drain provides the physical containment infrastructure that satisfies this requirement. When connected to an EPDM-lined cistern, the system creates a fully closed nutrient loop: irrigation water is applied to crops, drainage collects in the perimeter drain, flows to the cistern, and is recycled as irrigation water in the next cycle. The cistern volume can be monitored and metered to provide the quantitative data required in nutrient management plans submitted to DRAP (Direções Regionais de Agricultura e Pescas). Membriko designs these integrated containment systems as a complete specification — membrane, drainage, cistern connection, and documentation — rather than as separate elements.

### Groundwater Exclusion

Greenhouse production in areas with a high water table — the coastal plains of the Oeste, the estuary zones of the Algarve, the river valley floors of the Ribatejo — faces the opposite problem: not preventing drainage from going down, but preventing groundwater from coming up. When the water table rises seasonally to within one or two metres of the surface, capillary action can draw water upward through the floor substrate into the growing medium above, causing waterlogging, disrupting root zone drainage, and creating the anaerobic conditions that favour root disease pathogens including Phytophthora and Pythium species.

An EPDM floor membrane acts as a capillary break: a continuous, flexible, watertight layer at floor level that prevents upward water movement through the substrate while allowing the downward drainage designed into the floor system to function correctly. The perimeter drain above the membrane removes water from above; the membrane prevents water from rising from below. This dual-direction control of water movement is achievable only with a true waterproof membrane — not with ground cover films, which are permeable, or with geotextile drainage layers, which facilitate water movement rather than preventing it.

### Installation Sequence

Membriko installs greenhouse floor membranes in a consistent, well-documented sequence that ensures both watertightness and the protection of the membrane throughout the production life of the facility:

**Sub-base preparation.** The existing floor substrate is checked for compaction and planarity. Loose material, sharp stones, metal debris, and remnant root material are removed. Where the sub-base has settled unevenly, it is relevelled and recompacted before any membrane work begins. A sharp sub-base is the most common cause of floor membrane puncture during installation — Membriko treats sub-base quality as the primary installation risk to be controlled.

**Blinding layer.** On granular or earthwork sub-bases where the surface texture is too coarse to provide a safe installation surface, a blinding layer of sharp sand or lean concrete provides the smooth, clean surface that membrane installation requires. On existing concrete floors in good condition, the surface is ground flat, cleaned, and degreased before membrane installation.

**Membrane installation.** EPDM sheet is installed in the widest available widths — up to 15.25 metres — to minimise the number of seams in the floor. Sheets are positioned with 150-millimetre overlaps at all seams. On concrete sub-bases, the membrane is bonded with EPDM-compatible contact adhesive applied to the cleaned concrete. On earthwork sub-bases, the membrane is installed loose-lay, without adhesive, to allow for the minor substrate movements that occur during the first seasons of service.

**Perimeter upstands.** At all foundation walls, column bases, and perimeter edges, the membrane is turned up a minimum of 300 millimetres and mechanically fixed with a stainless steel termination bar. The upstand ensures that floor drainage is always directed to the collection system rather than escaping beneath the membrane edge.

**Seams and details.** All overlap seams are bonded with QuickSeam tape and activator primer, creating a monolithic watertight joint across the full seam length. All drain and downpipe penetrations through the floor are made using flanged EPDM accessories with compression ring bolts that create a watertight seal independent of adhesive or tape.

**Geotextile protection layer.** A needle-punched geotextile fleece at 200 to 300 g/m² is installed over the completed membrane before any growing beds, substrate, or foot traffic is allowed onto the floor. The geotextile absorbs mechanical impact from equipment and distributes point loads from bed frame legs. It can be replaced independently of the membrane if worn.

## Section 5: Irrigation Water Collection — Gutters, Channels, and Cisterns

The economic case for investing in high-quality waterproofing for greenhouse water collection infrastructure has never been stronger. In the Algarve, where mains irrigation water costs €0.80 to €1.20 per cubic metre, and where that cost is only likely to increase as aquifer levels decline and regulatory controls on abstraction tighten, the water that a well-designed collection system captures from greenhouse condensation and roof drainage is a production input with a quantifiable monetary value.

A one-hectare multi-span greenhouse with an eight-metre span pitch, operating in a standard tomato or cucumber production cycle, collects 400 to 600 cubic metres of water per year from condensation alone. At €1.00 per cubic metre, that is a water credit of €400 to €600 per hectare per year — enough to cover the annualised cost of a high-quality EPDM gutter lining system within three to five years, with fifty years of service life remaining thereafter.

For this economic case to be realised, the collection infrastructure must be watertight. A gutter system that leaks twenty percent of its condensation onto the greenhouse floor recovers eighty percent of the theoretical water credit and creates a chronic floor wetting problem that Membriko is then called to address — often at greater cost than specifying a proper EPDM lining system from the outset.

### Gutter Lining

Greenhouse inter-span and eaves gutters in aluminium or galvanised steel are fabricated with lapped or press-fitted sections, expansion joints, and internal corners — all of which are potential leakage paths under the combined effects of thermal movement, UV degradation of rubber gaskets, and the progressive galvanic corrosion that affects steel and aluminium in contact with condensate and fertiliser solution. Membriko lines these gutters with EPDM sheet in continuous runs, forming the sheet to the gutter profile — including internal corners, section joints, and outlet positions — without requiring any joints within the continuous gutter run. Seams occur only at downpipe outlets and at structural expansion joints, where flanged EPDM accessories create a watertight transition.

The 400% elongation of the EPDM membrane accommodates the significant thermal movement of an aluminium gutter structure that cycles between winter condensate temperatures and summer surface temperatures. The same movement that opens galvanic corrosion cracks at section joints is absorbed by the EPDM lining without creating stress concentrations. Installation is carried out from the exterior of the greenhouse structure — the gutter is lined from above, working from the ridge outward — without requiring production interruption in the crop below.

### Perimeter Collection Channels

The downpipes from gutter systems connect to perimeter collection channels that route collected water to the storage cistern. These channels — whether cast concrete, formed block-work, or earthwork channels with compacted bases — must be watertight both to prevent the loss of collected water into the surrounding soil and to prevent the ingress of surface runoff into the collection system, which would dilute the nutrient value of the stored condensate.

Membriko lines perimeter collection channels with EPDM in continuous sheet, with the membrane formed to the channel section profile and turned up the channel walls to provide a bathtub containment detail. Channel outlets to cistern inlets are connected with flanged EPDM accessories that create watertight transitions at all penetration points. The entire collection system — gutter, downpipe, collection channel, cistern — forms a single monolithic EPDM-lined waterway from the point of condensation to the point of reuse.

### Underground Cisterns

Water storage cisterns — whether in cast concrete, precast concrete rings, or formed block-work — are the terminal element of the collection system. Cisterns of 50 to 500 cubic metres are common in single-greenhouse or small multi-span installations; cisterns of 500 to 2,000 cubic metres serve large multi-span complexes with significant water storage requirements.

Membriko lines cisterns with EPDM sheet welded to the cistern dimensions. For cisterns narrower than 15.25 metres — the maximum available single-sheet width — the cistern base and two opposing walls can be lined with a single sheet, eliminating seams entirely from the base and short wall faces. Seams in the EPDM lining are confined to the perimeter joints between base and wall panels, where they are made with QuickSeam tape and primer to create a monolithic waterproof shell.

All penetrations — water inlet from collection channel, pump outlet for irrigation circuit, overflow connection, and access hatch frame — are made with flanged EPDM accessories providing compression-ring seals independent of tape or adhesive. The cistern is hydraulically tested before any backfill or cover slab is installed.

Chemical neutrality is a non-negotiable requirement for cistern liners in greenhouse installations. The water stored in these cisterns is used directly for crop irrigation, and any contamination of that water by membrane-derived compounds — plasticisers, biocides, heavy metal stabilisers — becomes a crop contamination issue. EPDM contains none of these compounds. Membriko provides ACS (France) and WRAS (UK) water contact certification with every cistern installation — certification originally developed for materials in contact with drinking water, whose standards are more demanding than those for irrigation water.

## Section 6: The Membriko Installation Process

Membriko follows a structured seven-stage installation process for all greenhouse waterproofing projects, from the initial site assessment through to the delivery of warranty documentation. The process is designed to be predictable, minimise production disruption, and produce a documented installation that satisfies the requirements of DRAP inspection, PDR2020/PT2030 subsidy applications, and organic certification files.

### Stage 1 — Technical Site Survey

Membriko conducts a no-charge technical site visit to every enquiring client. During the visit, the Membriko technical team records the greenhouse structure type, floor area, gutter geometry, existing drainage configuration, collection point locations, and substrate condition. All potential penetration points — downpipes, column bases, drain connections, ventilation duct perimeters — are identified and measured. The survey provides the information needed to prepare the membrane layout plan, material take-off, and installation programme.

### Stage 2 — Waterproofing Design

From the site survey data, Membriko prepares a waterproofing design document specifying: membrane sheet widths and positioning, seam locations, penetration detail types, perimeter termination method, and the connections between floor, gutter, and cistern elements. The design document includes a material take-off, a specification of all accessories, and an installation programme showing the construction sequence and the expected production impact at each stage. For facilities in NVZ-designated areas, the design document is prepared with the DRAP compliance file requirements in mind.

### Stage 3 — Substrate Preparation

All concrete surfaces in gutters, channels, and on existing floor slabs are cleaned, degreased, and repaired as needed. Cracks in concrete gutters wider than two millimetres are filled with flexible sealant before membrane installation. Earthwork sub-bases are checked for compaction and planarity, with relevelling and recompaction as required. Sharp protrusions — stone edges, metal debris, root remnants — are removed or ground down. The blinding layer is installed where surface texture requires it. Membriko treats substrate preparation as the most important single factor in long-term membrane performance; a poorly prepared substrate is the primary source of installation-stage punctures and post-installation membrane bedding failures.

### Stage 4 — Membrane Installation

EPDM sheet is delivered to site on rolls and installed in the widest possible widths to minimise seams. On concrete substrates, full-surface contact adhesive bonding is used, applying solvent-free EPDM contact adhesive to the primed concrete and to the underside of the membrane, allowing flash-off before pressing the membrane into firm contact. On earthwork substrates, loose-lay installation without adhesive is used, with the membrane positioned and perimeter upstands formed before the protective geotextile layer is installed. Perimeter upstands are mechanically fixed with stainless steel termination bars, with the membrane top edge sealed with EPDM-compatible flashing sealant to prevent water tracking behind the upstand.

### Stage 5 — Seams and Details

All seam overlaps — minimum 100 millimetres wide, typically 150 millimetres — are bonded with QuickSeam tape and primer. The primer is applied to both membrane faces within the seam area, allowed to flash off, and the QuickSeam tape is applied to one face before the two faces are pressed together with a seam roller. The completed seam has an adhesive bond strength that exceeds the tensile strength of the membrane in peel — failure under load occurs in the membrane body, not at the seam. Penetrations are formed using flanged EPDM pipe sleeves or drain accessories, with the flange bonded to the membrane face using QuickSeam tape and the pipe or drain fitting secured through the sleeve with a compression ring bolted to a face plate. Pre-cut EPDM patches are applied at all internal and external corners before the field sheet installation, ensuring corner details are fully formed without reliance on field-cut mitre joints.

### Stage 6 — Drainage and Collection Systems

After the floor membrane is complete, the perimeter collection drain is installed within the EPDM-lined channel. Gutter lining is connected to downpipe EPDM sleeves, which connect to the collection channel lining. The collection channel connects to the cistern through EPDM-lined inlet penetrations. All cistern penetrations — inlet, outlet pump connection, overflow, access frame — are formed with flanged accessories and sealed. The completed cistern is hydraulically tested with a 24-hour water-level observation before any backfill is placed over the cistern walls or roof slab is installed.

### Stage 7 — Inspection, Testing, and Documentation

The completed installation is inspected visually across every seam line, every perimeter termination, and every penetration detail. All gutter runs and collection channels are tested with running water from a hose at the upstream end, with visual observation at all potential leakage points. Where floor membranes are installed beneath a geotextile protection layer and cannot be visually re-inspected after geotextile placement, Membriko uses electronic leak detection equipment — a low-voltage holiday detection system — to confirm membrane continuity before geotextile installation.

Membriko delivers a complete handover documentation package to every client: the membrane manufacturer's technical data sheet and CE certification to EN 13956; ACS and WRAS water contact certification; the as-built drawing showing membrane sheet layout, seam positions, penetration locations, and drainage connections; and the 20-year Membriko installation warranty certificate. This documentation package is prepared in the format required for PDR2020/PT2030 rural development programme subsidy application files and DRAP inspection records.

## Section 7: EPDM Compared with Polyethylene Film, HDPE, Cementitious Coatings, and Bitumen

Portuguese greenhouse operators are frequently presented with lower-cost alternatives to EPDM membrane waterproofing. Understanding the true performance characteristics of each alternative — and particularly their behaviour over the long service periods that permanent agricultural infrastructure must deliver — is essential for making the right investment decision. The comparison must be made on total cost over the service life of the structure, not on material unit cost at the point of purchase.

### EPDM versus Black Polyethylene Ground Cover Film

Black polyethylene ground cover film at 0.2 to 0.3 millimetres thickness is the most common greenhouse floor treatment in Portugal. It is inexpensive, widely available from agricultural supply merchants, and familiar to every grower. It is not, however, a waterproofing membrane, and treating it as one creates a false sense of compliance that exposes the operator to regulatory and agronomic risk.

Ground cover PE film is a weed suppressor and a short-term moisture barrier. It cannot be reliably seamed — overlaps allow water to pass between sheets. It degrades under UV exposure within one to four years, becoming brittle and fragmenting into the growing substrate. It provides no resistance to root penetration. It does not provide the watertight containment required for Nitrate Vulnerable Zone compliance. And it cannot accommodate substrate movement — when the ground settles beneath it, the film tears.

Membriko installs EPDM floor membranes that provide 50-year service life, true watertight containment, EN 13948 root resistance, UV stability, and substrate movement accommodation. The annualised cost of a 50-year EPDM membrane is substantially lower than the repeated cost of PE film replacement at three to four-year intervals, once installation labour, crop disruption, and the regulatory risk of an inadequate containment system are factored into the comparison.

### EPDM versus HDPE Geomembrane

HDPE (high-density polyethylene) geomembrane is the most technically capable alternative to EPDM for agricultural containment applications, and Membriko acknowledges this honestly. For large-area cisterns and flat reservoirs where a thermowelding specialist can be mobilised with the necessary equipment, HDPE is a technically acceptable material. Its limitations in greenhouse applications are specific and important:

**Thermal brittleness.** HDPE becomes significantly stiffer and more brittle at temperatures below 0°C, reaching its glass transition temperature at approximately -100°C but exhibiting practically important increases in brittleness below 5°C. In Portuguese mountain growing regions and in winter conditions across the Oeste and Ribatejo, temperatures below 0°C occur regularly. An EPDM membrane at -45°C remains flexible and able to accommodate substrate movement. HDPE at sub-zero temperatures may crack under movement loads that EPDM would accommodate without distress.

**Seaming requirements.** HDPE seams require thermofusion welding — either hot wedge or extrusion welding — using specialist equipment that must be brought to site by a qualified thermowelding operator. For the complex geometries of greenhouse gutter systems, internal corners, column penetrations, and floor-to-wall transitions, thermofusion welding is practically difficult and the risk of defective seams at complex detail points is significantly higher than with EPDM's cold-bonded QuickSeam system.

**Flexibility at penetrations.** HDPE's relatively high stiffness creates stress concentrations at penetrations — particularly at pipe sleeves and drain accessories where the membrane must conform to the fitting geometry under bolt clamping. EPDM's elongation accommodates this conformance without stress concentration.

### EPDM versus Cementitious Coatings

Cementitious waterproofing applied to concrete gutter and cistern surfaces — whether slurry-coat systems, crystalline admixture systems, or polymer-modified render — is widely used in general construction and appears in some greenhouse gutter and cistern specifications. The fundamental limitation of all cementitious systems is that they are rigid and brittle. Concrete cracks. When the concrete cracks — from thermal movement, from structural load, from settlement — the cementitious waterproofing coating cracks with it. The waterproofing is lost at the crack, and repair requires draining, surface preparation, and reapplication.

EPDM membrane bridges substrate cracks. A crack in the concrete beneath an EPDM-lined gutter or cistern creates no corresponding failure in the EPDM above it — the membrane elongates locally across the crack width without loss of watertightness. For greenhouse gutter systems where the structural movement resulting from thermal cycling is significant, and for cisterns where concrete shrinkage cracking is essentially inevitable, EPDM provides the only reliable long-term waterproofing solution.

### EPDM versus Bituminous Membranes

Bituminous waterproofing — torch-applied APP or SBS-modified bitumen — is Portugal's most common general-purpose waterproofing material for building roofs and it has legitimate applications in many building contexts. It is not appropriate for any greenhouse application where the membrane contacts irrigation water, stored water, or growing media. Bituminous membranes can release hydrocarbon compounds into contact water under the elevated temperatures and UV exposure conditions encountered in greenhouse perimeter zones. This contamination precludes the use of bitumen-contacted water for crop irrigation and is incompatible with organic farming certification requirements. Membriko does not specify bituminous membranes for any greenhouse water-contact application.

## Section 8: Managing Humidity and Condensation

The internal environment of a greenhouse during the production season is, by design, warm and humid. Growers maintain relative humidity at 60% to 85% during the day to limit plant transpiration stress, and at night — when the external temperature drops and the heated internal air meets the cold inner face of the polyethylene film or glass covering — humidity rises to 100% and condensation forms on every cold surface.

This condensation is both a resource (it is essentially distilled water, free of the dissolved salts present in mains supply water) and a challenge. If it is not collected efficiently, it falls from the covering onto the crop canopy, creating wet foliage conditions that are favourable to fungal disease pathogens including Botrytis cinerea (grey mould), Didymella bryoniae (gummy stem blight in cucurbits), and various powdery mildew species. Correct gutter design and waterproofing ensures that condensate drains to the collection system rather than onto the crop.

### Condensation Volume

A standard single-span polyethylene tunnel greenhouse operating at 80% relative humidity with a 15°C interior temperature and 8°C exterior temperature — typical Portuguese winter production conditions — produces approximately 0.5 to 1.5 litres per square metre of condensate per day during the peak condensation period. In a greenhouse of 5,000 square metres, that represents 2,500 to 7,500 litres of condensate per day. Over a six-month winter production period, the cumulative condensate volume from a single tunnel of this size is 450,000 to 1,350,000 litres — between 450 and 1,350 cubic metres of recoverable water. In the context of Algarve water economics, that is a resource worth managing seriously.

The eaves gutter system — lined by Membriko with EPDM in continuous sheet — captures this condensate and routes it via downpipes to the perimeter collection channel and ultimately to the storage cistern. The watertightness of every element of this pathway determines what proportion of the theoretical condensate collection is actually realised.

### Foundation Corrosion Protection

The junction between greenhouse structure and foundation is the most vulnerable point for accelerated corrosion in the entire facility. At this location, galvanised steel column base plates and perimeter frame members are in simultaneous contact with the moisture in the soil, the condensate that runs down the structure to floor level, and in many cases with irrigation splash that accumulates against the base of the structure.

Membriko installs EPDM apron membranes at foundation level as a standard element of every greenhouse waterproofing project. The apron extends a minimum of 300 millimetres above finished floor level and 300 millimetres below ground level, encasing the most vulnerable zone of the steel-to-concrete interface in a watertight EPDM barrier. This relatively modest installation — measured in linear metres of perimeter rather than square metres of floor — significantly reduces the corrosion rate at the point where structural failure, if it occurs, has the most serious consequences. Growers who have installed this apron membrane at the time of initial construction consistently report better structural condition at five and ten-year inspection intervals than comparable structures without it.

### Floor Drainage Design

The greenhouse floor is graded at a fall of 0.5% to 1.0% towards the perimeter collection drain. The EPDM floor membrane is installed below the geotextile protection layer, so that drainage water — condensate falling from the structure, excess irrigation water, cleaning water from between-crop sterilisation — passes through the permeable geotextile into the membrane-lined floor zone and then flows along the membrane surface to the perimeter drain. The membrane prevents this water from percolating into the substrate below, whilst the drainage fall ensures it reaches the collection point.

### Condensation Quality versus Roof Runoff

Where the hydraulic system allows separation, Membriko recommends collecting interior condensate separately from exterior roof runoff. Interior condensate is essentially distilled water — low dissolved solids, low particulate load, highly suitable for direct reuse in fertigation systems. Exterior roof runoff from polyethylene film or glass surfaces carries dust, particulates, and in some environments, pollen and atmospheric deposition that reduce the water quality relative to condensate. Separated collection allows the higher-quality condensate stream to be used directly in the irrigation system whilst the exterior runoff is directed to a secondary storage or treatment system.

## Section 10: Maintenance of EPDM Greenhouse Waterproofing

One of the most commercially significant advantages of specifying EPDM membrane waterproofing for greenhouse infrastructure is the exceptionally low maintenance requirement over the service life of the installation. An EPDM membrane correctly installed by Membriko does not require periodic retreatment, surface recoating, re-sealing of joints, or planned replacement within a 50-year horizon. The maintenance programme for a Membriko EPDM installation consists of observation, not intervention.

### Annual Inspection

Membriko recommends a simple annual visual inspection of all seam lines, perimeter terminations, and penetration details. This inspection can be carried out by the producer using the maintenance guide that Membriko delivers at handover — it does not require a specialist waterproofing contractor. The inspection checks that perimeter upstands have not been displaced by growing bed movement or equipment contact, that drain penetration accessories have not been disturbed, and that there are no visible signs of mechanical damage to exposed membrane sections. In most installations, the annual inspection confirms that no action is required and takes less than one hour.

### Gutter Maintenance

Gutter channels accumulate organic debris — leaf material, crop fragments, insects, dust deposits — that can build up to the point where water overflows the gutter rather than flowing to the downpipes. This is a drainage maintenance matter, not a membrane maintenance matter: the gutter lining is not damaged by debris accumulation, but if the debris prevents water from reaching the downpipes, the economic value of the condensate collection system is reduced. Membriko recommends cleaning all gutter runs at least twice per year — at the start and end of the main production season — to maintain drainage function.

### Floor Membrane and Geotextile Layer

The geotextile protection layer above the floor membrane absorbs the mechanical stresses of foot traffic, growing bed frame installation, and maintenance equipment operation. The EPDM membrane beneath it is protected from all of these stresses by the geotextile. If the geotextile is torn or displaced — by a sharp object, by equipment, or by subsidence of a growing bed — Membriko recommends inspecting the EPDM beneath before restoring full traffic access, to confirm that the membrane has not been damaged. The geotextile can be replaced or patched independently of the EPDM.

### Repair of Accidental Damage

Where accidental damage to the EPDM membrane does occur — a puncture from a displaced metal stake, a cut from maintenance tooling, a tear at a penetration point from settling equipment — the repair is straightforward. An EPDM patch bonded with activator primer and QuickSeam tape over the damaged area restores full waterproofing performance. The repair requires no specialist equipment, no heat source, and no curing time. Most repairs are completed in under two hours without draining cisterns or removing growing bed systems. All repairs are recorded in the installation warranty file and confirmed in writing to the producer.

### Greenhouse Disinfection Compatibility

Standard Portuguese greenhouse sterilisation protocols — hydrogen peroxide at 3-5%, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite at agricultural concentrations — are all chemically compatible with EPDM membrane. No protective measures are required during routine sterilisation operations. The membrane does not need to be shielded, covered, or temporarily removed during between-crop disinfection. This compatibility is confirmed by the chemical resistance data under ISO 175 and ASTM D471.

### Membriko Inspection Service

Membriko offers a formal technical inspection service at five years and ten years post-installation for all warranted greenhouse projects. The inspection is conducted on site by Membriko's technical team, who examine all seam lines, penetration details, perimeter terminations, and drainage connections and provide a written condition report. This report is delivered to the producer for inclusion in the facility's maintenance record and subsidy audit file. For producers operating under PDR2020/PT2030 subsidy conditions that require evidence of maintained installation performance, the Membriko inspection report provides the required documentation.

## Section 11: The Portuguese Greenhouse Sector — Algarve, Oeste, Alentejo, and Beyond

Membriko is based in Pombal, Leiria, at the geographical heart of Portugal's Centro region. From this base, the Membriko technical team operates across the entire national territory, with established experience in each of Portugal's primary protected horticulture regions and a detailed understanding of the climate, regulatory, and agronomic characteristics that differentiate each one.

### Algarve

The Algarve's Barlavento and Sotavento coastal plains support more than 3,000 hectares of protected horticulture, concentrated in the municipalities of Lagos, Portimão, Silves, Loulé, and Tavira. Primary crops are tomato, pepper, and cucumber for export to northern European markets, with strawberry and ornamentals accounting for significant additional production area. The Algarve is Portugal's warmest and sunniest growing region, with 2,800 to 3,000 hours of sunshine per year — a climatic advantage for crop production that is partially offset by the most severe water scarcity of any agricultural region in mainland Portugal.

Annual rainfall of 400 to 600 millimetres, entirely concentrated in the October to March period, leaves the critical summer production season entirely dependent on stored water, abstracted groundwater, or mains supply from the Sistema Integrado de Abastecimento de Água do Algarve. The 2022 drought — the most extreme since records began — forced many Algarve greenhouse operators to install or upgrade water storage and collection systems on an urgent basis. Membriko has been active in this work throughout the region, installing EPDM-lined cisterns, gutter collection systems, and floor containment membranes in new and retrofitted Algarve greenhouse facilities.

DRAP Algarve actively promotes water efficiency investment in the horticultural sector and supports subsidy applications under PDR2020/PT2030 for eligible water storage and collection infrastructure. Membriko's documentation package — membrane certification, as-built drawings, 20-year warranty, ACS/WRAS water contact certification — is prepared to meet the requirements of these subsidy files.

### Oeste (Estremadura)

The Oeste municipalities of Torres Vedras, Caldas da Rainha, Óbidos, and Peniche represent the highest concentration of tunnel greenhouse horticulture in mainland Portugal. The region's Atlantic climate — milder than the Algarve in summer, wetter in winter, with 700 to 900 millimetres of annual rainfall and reliable Atlantic rainfall pattern — creates reliable growing conditions for tomato, strawberry, lettuce, and ornamental crops. Proximity to Lisbon (less than 90 minutes from Torres Vedras) and to Lisbon International Airport provides market access and export logistics that make the Oeste commercially strategic for intensive horticulture.

The Tejo estuary catchment designation as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone creates compliance pressure for Oeste greenhouse operators whose facilities sit within the designated area. For these producers, EPDM floor membranes with perimeter collection drains and EPDM-lined cisterns are not optional upgrades — they are the physical infrastructure of regulatory compliance. Membriko's base in Pombal places the Oeste within 90 minutes of the technical team — a practical proximity that makes site survey, installation, and follow-up maintenance accessible without the mobilisation costs of contractors based in Lisbon or Porto.

### Alentejo Litoral

The Alentejo Litoral — particularly the municipalities of Odemira and Santiago do Cacém — is the fastest-growing protected horticulture zone in Portugal, driven by large-scale investment in berry production (strawberry, blueberry, raspberry) and advanced controlled environment agriculture by Portuguese and international operators. The scale of investment in this region — multi-hundred-hectare operations, purpose-built multi-span complexes, automated irrigation and climate control systems — means that new facilities are being designed and built to full technical specification from the outset, including complete waterproofing systems for floor containment, gutter collection, and water storage.

Membriko has participated in the growth of the Alentejo Litoral sector as a waterproofing specification partner for new CEA facilities, providing EPDM systems designed to meet the production, regulatory, and sustainability criteria of operators whose facilities are built to international standards. For these operators, Membriko's documentation package — including EN 13956 CE certification, ACS/WRAS water contact certification, and 20-year installation warranty — provides the evidence base for internal investment justification and for reporting to agricultural subsidy bodies and environmental regulatory authorities.

### Ribatejo and Centro

The Ribatejo river valley and the broader Centro region — including the municipalities of Santarém, Golegã, Almeirim, and the horticultural and floriculture areas around Caldas da Rainha and Leiria — represent a mixed production zone of older greenhouse stock, smaller-scale growers, and a growing proportion of facilities seeking to upgrade waterproofing systems as part of broader investment in production infrastructure. For smaller growers who cannot justify the mobilisation cost of a Lisbon-based waterproofing contractor, Membriko's location in Pombal — at the centre of the Centro region — provides direct, cost-efficient access to professional EPDM waterproofing installation.

---

## Section 12: Regulatory Framework — DRAP, APA, Nitrates Directive, and Subsidy Documentation

Understanding the regulatory requirements that apply to greenhouse waterproofing in Portugal is essential for making an informed investment decision. Membriko designs its installation and documentation process around these requirements, so that every installation produces not only a watertight physical system but also the documentary evidence that producers need for compliance files, subsidy applications, and inspection records.

### EU Nitrates Directive and Portuguese NVZ Designation

EU Directive 91/676/EEC (the Nitrates Directive) requires member states to designate Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in areas where nitrate leaching to groundwater is a documented environmental problem, and to implement Good Agricultural Practice codes that include physical containment requirements for intensive agricultural operations in these zones. Portugal's implementation — through Decreto-Lei 235/97 as amended, and Portaria 259/2012 — designates extensive NVZ areas in the Tejo and Sado river basins, the Algarve coastal plain, parts of the Norte region, and other agricultural catchments.

Greenhouse operators in NVZ-designated areas who cannot demonstrate physical containment of nutrient leaching face inspection penalties and potential exclusion from rural development programme subsidies. An EPDM floor membrane with perimeter collection drain and EPDM-lined cistern provides the physical containment infrastructure that satisfies the Good Agricultural Practice requirements under Portaria 259/2012. DRAP regional inspectors recognise CE-certified membrane installation with a documented warranty as satisfactory evidence of nutrient containment intent. Membriko delivers the installation documentation that integrates directly into the producer's NVZ compliance file.

### APA — Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente

Portugal's national environmental authority, APA, oversees compliance with EU water legislation including the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and the Nitrates Directive. Greenhouse facilities located near surface water bodies, within water source protection zones, or adjacent to designated aquifer recharge areas may require an environmental licence (Título de Utilização dos Recursos Hídricos) that includes a demonstration of runoff and nutrient containment. EPDM waterproofing installation documentation — membrane CE certification, as-built drawings showing the containment system configuration, and Membriko's installation warranty — provides the evidence base required for these licence applications and for APA inspection compliance.

### PDR2020 and PT2030 Rural Development Subsidies

Portugal's rural development programme subsidies — under PDR2020 and its successor PT2030 — include investment support measures for greenhouse modernisation and water efficiency infrastructure. Applications for these subsidies must include technical documentation of the installed systems. The documentation requirements vary between measures and between DRAP regional authorities, but typically include: a technical specification of the installed membrane with CE certification; evidence of the contractor's technical capability (installation warranty); and as-built drawings demonstrating that the installed system matches the approved investment description.

Membriko prepares its standard handover documentation package to satisfy these requirements. The package includes: the membrane manufacturer's full technical data sheet and EN 13956 CE declaration of performance; ACS and WRAS water contact certification; as-built drawings at 1:100 or 1:50 scale showing membrane layout, seam positions, penetration details, and drainage system connections; the 20-year Membriko installation warranty certificate; and a photographic installation record. Producers who have used this documentation package for PDR2020 applications have reported successful subsidy approval without requests for supplementary technical information.

### EU Organic Regulation 2018/848

For greenhouse operators operating under EU organic certification (Regulation 2018/848), the compatibility of all materials in contact with organic production inputs — water, growing media, soil — with organic production requirements is a certification condition. EPDM membrane is compatible with EU Organic Regulation requirements. It contains no plasticisers (phthalates and adipates are not approved for contact with organic production inputs), no organotin or heavy metal stabilisers, no synthetic biocides incorporated into the polymer matrix, and no organohalogen compounds. The sulphur vulcanisation system used in EPDM — based on elemental sulphur and organic accelerators — does not appear on prohibited substance lists under the EU organic regulation.

Membriko provides membrane formulation data and ACS/WRAS water contact certification in a format suitable for submission to organic certification bodies. This documentation package has been accepted by Ecocert and CERTIS for organic greenhouse production projects in Portugal and France.

---

## Section 13: Organic Farming Compatibility in Detail

Certified organic greenhouse production is a rapidly growing and commercially premium segment of Portuguese horticulture. Export demand from Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK — where organic fresh produce commands a price premium of 30% to 100% over conventional equivalents — is the primary driver. Organic growing area in Portugal is expanding at approximately 8% per year, with the Alentejo and the Algarve as the primary organic vegetable regions.

For a greenhouse operator committed to organic certification, the choice of waterproofing membrane is a certification-relevant decision. The EU Organic Regulation 2018/848 requires that all materials in direct or indirect contact with organic production — including materials in contact with irrigation water used on organic crops, and materials in contact with growing media or soil in organic production areas — do not introduce prohibited synthetic substances into the production system. A waterproofing membrane installed in an organic greenhouse that leaches plasticisers, biocides, or heavy metal stabilisers into irrigation water storage could compromise the operator's organic certification.

### EPDM's Organic Compliance Profile

EPDM's compatibility with EU organic production requirements follows directly from its material composition:

**No plasticisers.** EPDM achieves its flexibility entirely through the elastomeric structure of the vulcanised polymer — no phthalate, adipate, or other plasticiser ester is incorporated. This is the single most important characteristic for organic certification compliance, as phthalate plasticisers are prohibited under EU organic regulation and are specifically tested for in contact material assessments by European certification bodies including Ecocert.

**No organotin stabilisers.** EPDM does not use organotin compounds (DBTL, DBTDL, or similar) as vulcanisation catalysts or stabilisers, unlike some PVC-based membranes where organotin content can be a certification problem.

**No synthetic biocides.** Some synthetic membrane materials incorporate fungicide or biocide compounds as anti-mould agents. EPDM contains no incorporated biocides.

**No organohalogen compounds.** EPDM contains no chlorine, fluorine, or bromine compounds, eliminating the organohalogen contamination concern that applies to chlorinated polyethylene, PVC, and some CSPE-based membranes.

**Simple, documentable additive package.** The additive package in standard EPDM geomembrane is essentially carbon black (approximately 40 phr, as UV stabiliser and reinforcing filler), sulphur (as vulcanising agent), and organic accelerators (typically TMTD, MBT, or similar sulphur vulcanisation accelerators at low concentrations). None of these appear on prohibited substance lists under EU Regulation 2018/848. The simplicity of the additive package makes documentation for organic certification bodies straightforward.

### Practical Organic Certification Process

Membriko recommends that organic greenhouse operators who are specifying EPDM membrane waterproofing contact their certification body — whether Ecocert, CERTIS, ABAE, or another EU-accredited organic control body — before installation to confirm approval of the specific membrane product. Membriko provides the membrane formulation data sheet, the EN 13956 CE certification, and the ACS/WRAS water contact certification in a format prepared for certification body review. Membriko has supported this documentation process for organic greenhouse projects in Portugal, and the EPDM products it installs have been approved by Ecocert France and CERTIS Portugal in these projects.

### Distinction from HDPE in Organic Applications

Some HDPE geomembranes include antioxidant packages — hindered phenol antioxidants such as Irganox 1010 — at concentrations that can be extracted by contact water. The regulatory status of these antioxidants under EU organic regulation is not uniformly clear, and some certification bodies have requested additional documentation or restriction conditions for HDPE membrane use in organic water contact applications. EPDM's simpler additive package avoids this ambiguity and makes the certification documentation process more straightforward.

## Section 14: Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Is EPDM membrane chemically compatible with the fertilisers and crop protection products used in my greenhouse?

Yes. EPDM has documented chemical resistance to the full range of agrochemical inputs used in Portuguese protected horticulture. This includes NPK fertiliser solutions at all normal concentrations, chelated micronutrient preparations (iron-EDTA, manganese-EDTA, zinc-EDTA), copper sulphate fungicide solutions at spray and drench concentrations, sulphuric acid and nitric acid at pH-correction concentrations (1–5%), systemic insecticides and acaricides in dilute solution, and quaternary ammonium disinfectants used in between-crop greenhouse sterilisation. Chemical resistance data under ASTM D471 and ISO 175 confirms zero measurable mechanical property change after 1,000 hours of immersion in NPK fertiliser solution at 40°C. The membrane does not degrade under agrochemical contact and does not release contaminants into contact water. Membriko can provide the relevant chemical resistance test data on request.

### 2. Can I use water collected from EPDM-lined gutters and cisterns directly for crop irrigation?

Yes. EPDM membrane is certified for contact with water intended for human consumption under ACS (France) and WRAS (UK) certifications. The standard applicable to water used for crop irrigation is less demanding than the drinking water standard, so ACS/WRAS certification provides a strong assurance of water quality suitability for irrigation reuse. EPDM contains no plasticisers, synthetic biocides, or heavy metal stabilisers that could contaminate stored water. Membriko provides ACS and WRAS certification documentation with every relevant installation — this documentation is suitable for inclusion in subsidy application files and regulatory compliance records. For organic-certified producers, Membriko also provides membrane formulation data for submission to certification bodies.

### 3. What thickness of EPDM membrane is appropriate for my greenhouse floor?

For standard floor containment on a prepared sub-base — whether compacted granular material or a blinding concrete layer — Membriko installs 1.14 mm EPDM with a 200 to 300 g/m² needle-punched geotextile protection layer. Where the floor must accommodate forklift truck access, heavy growing bed infrastructure, or other concentrated point loads, Membriko specifies 1.5 mm. Gutters and cisterns are lined with 1.5 mm as standard. The appropriate specification for your facility is determined at the technical site visit, where Membriko assesses the production system, traffic loads, and substrate conditions. There is no charge for the technical visit or for the written specification that follows it.

### 4. Does EPDM membrane resist root penetration from high-vigour greenhouse crops such as tomato and cucumber?

Yes. EPDM root resistance is tested and certified under EN 13948, the European standard for root-resistant waterproofing membranes originally developed for green roof applications where the membrane must resist root penetration across the full service life of the installation without any maintenance access. The EN 13948 test involves direct, sustained contact with living root systems under conditions designed to simulate the mechanical and chemical action of roots over decades of service. No commercially grown greenhouse crop in Portugal — including high-vigour species such as tomato, cucumber, courgette, and ornamental climbers — can penetrate an EN 13948-compliant EPDM membrane. Membriko supplies EN 13948 certification with every floor membrane installation where root contact is a design consideration.

### 5. I have a two-hectare multi-span greenhouse complex. Is EPDM viable for the entire inter-span gutter system?

Yes — and multi-span gutter systems are precisely the application where EPDM's advantages over alternative materials are most clearly demonstrated. The inter-span gutter system of a two-hectare complex typically extends to 1,200 to 1,500 linear metres. Maintaining watertightness across this length through the thermal cycling of an aluminium or galvanised steel structure is not reliably achievable with unlined gutters, compression-seal section joints, or cementitious gutter channel coatings. Membriko lines multi-span gutter systems with EPDM in continuous sheet runs per gutter, with seams only at downpipe outlets and structural expansion joints. The cold-bonded QuickSeam seaming system requires no specialist equipment on site and can be applied with the greenhouse structure in production — there is no requirement to dismantle gutter sections or interrupt crop cycles. Membriko has experience with multi-span systems up to five hectares and produces a detailed installation programme for every project, including the expected production impact at each stage.

### 6. Will membrane installation require interrupting crop production?

It depends on the application. For gutter lining, Membriko installs from the exterior of the structure — working from the ridge level downward — and in most cases the crop production inside the greenhouse continues without interruption throughout the gutter installation works. For floor waterproofing, the area under installation must be cleared of crops and growing infrastructure for the duration of the work. Membriko programmes floor installations in sections, working with the producer's crop rotation calendar to minimise the production area out of use at any one time. A typical single-bay floor installation of 1,000 to 2,000 square metres is completed in three to five working days. A full one-hectare floor installation is typically completed in seven to ten working days, depending on substrate preparation requirements.

### 7. What documentation does Membriko provide for my PDR2020 or PT2030 subsidy application?

Membriko delivers a complete documentation package at project handover, designed to meet the requirements of PDR2020 and PT2030 rural development programme subsidy files and DRAP inspection records. The package includes: the membrane manufacturer's full technical data sheet and EN 13956 CE declaration of performance; ACS (France) and WRAS (UK) water contact certification; as-built drawings at 1:100 or 1:50 scale showing membrane sheet layout, seam positions, penetration detail locations, and drainage system connections; a photographic installation record covering key installation stages; and the 20-year Membriko installation warranty certificate. If your subsidy application requires additional technical information — specific test certificates, product declarations, or installation method statements — Membriko can provide supplementary documentation on request.

### 8. My greenhouse is in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone. Does EPDM membrane resolve the compliance issue?

An EPDM floor membrane with perimeter collection drain, EPDM-lined collection channel, and EPDM-lined cistern provides the complete physical containment infrastructure that demonstrates compliance with the Good Agricultural Practice requirements for intensive greenhouse operations under Portaria 259/2012 — Portugal's implementation of the EU Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC. DRAP regional inspectors recognise CE-certified membrane installation with a documented installation warranty as satisfactory evidence of nutrient containment intent. The closed-loop system — membrane floor draining to collection channel draining to cistern, with the stored drainage water recycled as irrigation — further supports compliance with the nutrient management plan requirements that NVZ designation imposes on intensive greenhouse operations. Membriko delivers the full installation documentation package that becomes part of your farm's NVZ compliance file. If you are preparing a compliance file for a DRAP inspection or for a subsidy application, Membriko's technical team can advise on the documentation requirements specific to your regional DRAP authority.
