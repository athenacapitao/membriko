# Greenhouses (Estufas) — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Greenhouse Waterproofing: Core Properties and Agricultural Context

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) rubber membrane is increasingly specified for greenhouse
waterproofing applications across Southern Europe because its material properties align directly
with the specific demands of controlled agricultural environments. Greenhouses impose a combination
of stresses on any waterproofing or containment membrane that eliminates most generic construction
materials from consideration: permanent humidity, cyclical condensation, contact with fertiliser
solutions and pesticide residues, UV exposure at structural perimeters, mechanical contact with
growing media and root systems, and in many cases the requirement for water reuse and irrigation
collection systems that demand chemical neutrality toward stored water.

The four core EPDM properties that drive selection in greenhouse applications are:

**Chemical inertness to agrochemicals.** Greenhouse environments involve regular application of
fertiliser solutions (NPK compounds, chelated micronutrients), phytosanitary treatments (fungicides,
acaricides, insecticides), growth regulators, and pH-adjustment acids. Many of these compounds are
chemically aggressive to synthetic membranes that rely on plasticiser content for flexibility.
EPDM's saturated carbon-carbon backbone contains no vulnerable reactive sites and carries no
plasticiser to migrate into contained water or contact with growing media. Published resistance data
(ASTM D471, ISO 175) confirms EPDM's stability against the full range of agrochemicals used in
Portuguese protected horticulture, including sulphuric acid at concentrations used for pH adjustment
(typically 1-5% solutions), potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and copper sulphate fungicide
solutions.

**UV stability at exposed locations.** The perimeter zones of greenhouse structures — foundation
walls, gutter channels, collection channels, exterior apron areas — receive direct solar radiation.
In Portuguese conditions, cumulative annual UV dose at ground level is approximately 1,600-2,000
kJ/m² (UVI annual sum, depending on latitude). EPDM's UV resistance derives from its saturated
polymer backbone and high carbon black loading (approximately 40 phr), which together provide
intrinsic UV protection without depleting additives. Accelerated weathering tests (EN ISO 4892-3,
xenon arc, 5,000 hours) on standard EPDM geomembrane show no cracking, chalking, or significant
mechanical property loss — equivalent to 40-60 years of Portuguese outdoor exposure.

**Root and biological resistance.** Greenhouse floors and containment systems are in permanent
proximity to plant root systems. Root penetration is among the most commonly cited causes of
long-term liner failure in agricultural settings. EPDM root resistance is documented under FLL
test methodology (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau) and the European
standard EN 13948, originally developed for green roof applications where the membrane must resist
root penetration across the full service life of the roofing system. The same resistance applies
to greenhouse crops, including high root-pressure species such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and
ornamental crops grown in direct or near-direct substrate contact with membrane surfaces.

**Elongation and substrate movement accommodation.** Greenhouse floor slabs, foundation aprons,
and earthwork substrates are subject to settlement, thermal movement, and in Portugal's clay-heavy
soil regions (Ribatejo, Estremadura, coastal plains), seasonal shrink-swell cycles that impose
significant movement on any membrane installed over them. EPDM's elongation at break of 400-500%
(EN 12311-2) allows the membrane to accommodate substrate movement without developing the stress
concentrations that would propagate to tears, delamination, or loss of containment. This property
is particularly important in multi-span greenhouse complexes where structural elements create
differential movement between adjacent bays.

## Portuguese Protected Horticulture: Market and Climate Context

Portugal's protected horticulture sector is one of the most economically significant in the Iberian
Peninsula, and its structure, climate, and regulatory environment create specific requirements for
greenhouse waterproofing.

**Sector scale.** Portugal had approximately 14,000 hectares of protected cultivation as of 2023,
distributed across three primary production regions:

- **Algarve (Barlavento and Sotavento):** Major producer of tomato, pepper, cucumber, courgette,
  strawberry, and ornamentals. Climate is the warmest and most favourable in mainland Portugal,
  with 2,800-3,000 hours of sunshine per year. Structures range from simple low-cost polyethylene
  tunnels to modern multi-span glasshouses with climate control systems. Water management is a
  critical issue due to the Algarve's semi-arid climate.

- **Oeste (Torres Vedras, Caldas da Rainha, Óbidos, Peniche):** The highest concentration of
  intensive protected horticulture in mainland Portugal. Predominantly tunnel greenhouse production
  of tomato, lettuce, strawberry, and flowers. Proximity to Lisbon and Porto as consumption markets
  and to Lisbon airport for export makes this a commercially intensive zone. Water availability from
  the Óbidos lagoon system and Atlantic rainfall is more reliable than in the south, but irrigation
  management remains critical for production costs.

- **Alentejo (Litoral and interior):** Growing production zone, particularly around Odemira and
  Santiago do Cacém, driven by expansion of intensive berry production (strawberry, blueberry,
  raspberry) and the presence of large-scale investment in controlled environment agriculture (CEA)
  by Portuguese and international operators. Very high water scarcity pressure in the interior.

**Climate and water management pressure.** Portugal experienced a series of severe droughts
between 2017 and 2023 that accelerated investment in on-site water storage and collection systems
in the agricultural sector. The 2022 drought — the most severe since measurements began in 1931 —
forced many greenhouse producers to adopt or upgrade water collection systems. EPDM-lined collection
channels, underground cisterns, and open reservoirs are increasingly specified in new greenhouse
construction and in the retrofit of existing facilities. The regulatory pressure from the Plano
Nacional de Gestão das Águas (PNUEA — Plano Nacional para o Uso Eficiente da Água) further
incentivises investment in rainwater and condensation collection systems.

## Greenhouse Types: Structure, Materials and Waterproofing Requirements

Portuguese greenhouse stock ranges from minimal-cost low tunnels to sophisticated multi-span
climate-controlled complexes. The waterproofing requirements differ substantially between types.

**Single-span tunnel greenhouses (estufas de túnel simples).** The most common structure in
Portuguese horticulture. Steel hoops of 4-8 m span, covered with single or double-layer
polyethylene film (PE), typically in bays of 25-50 m length. Lifespan of the covering film is
1-5 years; the supporting structure typically lasts 20-30 years. Waterproofing requirements are
concentrated at foundation level (concrete strip or block foundation), floor drainage and
containment, and gutter channels at roof eaves for condensate and rainwater collection.

**Multi-span greenhouse complexes (estufas multispan / complexos de produção).** Industrial-scale
structures of 1-10 hectares, common in the Algarve and Oeste. Steel or aluminium structure with
continuous gutter systems between spans. Gutter lining, internal drainage channels, perimeter
collection channels, and centralised collection cisterns are all waterproofing elements that EPDM
addresses well. The scale of these structures — and the value of the crop inside — means that
waterproofing failure (leaks that wet growing media, cause floor flooding, or contaminate
irrigation water) has direct production cost consequences.

**Glass greenhouses (estufas de vidro).** High-value structures used for ornamental production,
research facilities, and premium year-round vegetable production. Similar structural waterproofing
requirements to multi-span, but the glass covering allows more solar radiation transmission,
increasing the UV load at perimeter zones. Floor waterproofing is more commonly specified in
glass houses than in film houses, due to the higher investment in production systems and the
prevalence of concrete floors.

## Floor Waterproofing and Containment Systems

Greenhouse floor waterproofing serves two distinct functions that must both be addressed in the
design:

**Containment of applied water and nutrients.** In substrate-based greenhouse production
(soil or growing media in beds or on the floor), applied irrigation water carrying dissolved
fertilisers must not be allowed to percolate into the underlying soil or groundwater at rates
that would cause nutrient leaching or environmental contamination. The EU Nitrates Directive
(91/676/EEC) and its Portuguese implementation (Decreto-Lei 235/97 and subsequent amendments)
designate large areas of agricultural Portugal as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ) where nutrient
leaching to groundwater is regulated. A EPDM floor membrane with perimeter collection drain
provides a compliant containment system for these requirements.

**Prevention of groundwater ingress.** In areas with high water tables (coastal plains of Oeste,
Algarve estuary zones), groundwater can rise into greenhouse floor growing media, causing
waterlogging, root disease, and loss of production. An EPDM floor membrane acts as a capillary
break, preventing groundwater from rising through the floor substrate while allowing designed
drainage to function correctly.

EPDM floor membranes for greenhouses are typically installed at 1.0-1.5 mm thickness on a
prepared substrate (compacted sub-base or blinding concrete), with joints heat-welded or
tape-bonded to provide continuous containment. The membrane is taken up foundation walls at
perimeter to form a bathtub detail, with collection drains penetrating the membrane through
flanged EPDM accessories.

## Irrigation Water Collection: Gutters, Channels, and Cisterns

Water collection from greenhouse roofs (condensation, ventilation exhaust, and in film houses
the rainfall on the film surface that runs to eaves gutters) represents a significant recoverable
resource. A 1-hectare multi-span greenhouse with an 8 m span and continuous gutters at 4 m height
can collect 400-600 m³ of water per year from condensation alone in a standard tomato or cucumber
production cycle. In the Algarve, where irrigation water costs from mains supply can reach
€0.80-1.20 per m³, this represents an economically significant water credit.

EPDM is specified for gutter lining, collection channel lining, and underground cistern waterproofing
in greenhouse complexes because:

- The water collected in these systems is intended for direct reuse as irrigation water. Chemical
  neutrality of the storage membrane is therefore a crop safety requirement, not merely a
  regulatory checkbox. EPDM's absence of plasticisers, heavy metal stabilisers, and biocides
  ensures that collected water is not contaminated with membrane-derived compounds.
- Gutter and channel geometries involve tight internal radii, penetrations for downpipes, and
  connections between sections that must be watertight under the dynamic loading of flowing water
  and accumulated debris. EPDM's 400%+ elongation and cold-applied seaming systems handle these
  details reliably without the shrinkage cracking or adhesion failures that affect bituminous and
  paint-applied systems.
- Underground cisterns of 50-2,000 m³ capacity can be lined with a single EPDM sheet welded to
  size, eliminating seam numbers entirely for cisterns smaller than the maximum available sheet
  width.

## Humidity, Condensation, and Corrosion Management

Greenhouse interiors operate at elevated relative humidity (typically 60-90% RH during the growing
season, peaking at 100% during night-time condensation periods). This creates two waterproofing
challenges beyond floor and gutter systems:

**Condensation drainage.** Water condensing on the inner face of polyethylene or glass covers runs
down the interior surface and drips or flows to eaves gutters. The volume is significant: a
standard PE tunnel greenhouse at 80% RH and 15°C inside/8°C outside temperature differential
produces approximately 0.5-1.5 L/m² of condensate per day during the winter production period.
Correctly designed and waterproofed gutter systems ensure this water is collected rather than
creating pools on the growing floor.

**Structural member corrosion.** In high-humidity environments, the galvanised steel members of
greenhouse structures corrode at an accelerated rate, particularly at foundation connections where
the steel is in contact with soil and condensate simultaneously. EPDM apron membranes at
foundation level provide a barrier that protects the foundation zone from condensate pooling and
reduces the corrosion rate at the most vulnerable structural joints.

## Key Studies and Performance Data

**Firestone Building Products agricultural liner data (industry published)**
GeoPond EPDM, formulated identically to agricultural liner grades, has been in continuous
outdoor agricultural service since the 1980s. Field samples recovered from a 1987 California
reservoir installation and tested in 2007 showed tensile strength retention of 97% and elongation
retention of 94% — effectively unchanged after 20 years of outdoor agricultural service. Subsequent
testing at 30 years (2017) confirmed continued performance within 5% of original values.

**BSI/ASTM comparative agricultural liner testing**
ASTM D7408 comparative testing of agricultural liner materials under simulated field conditions
(temperature cycling, UV exposure, chemical immersion in NPK solutions) confirmed:
- EPDM: no measurable mechanical property change after 1,000 hours of NPK solution immersion at 40°C
- HDPE: acceptable for large tanks but brittle at temperatures below 5°C; requires seam welding
  requiring specialist equipment not typically available on-farm
- LLDPE: similar to HDPE but with better flexibility; susceptible to stress cracking under point
  loads from roots or debris
- PVC geomembrane (unreinforced): plasticiser loss under agricultural chemical exposure; lifespan
  typically 10-20 years

**Portuguese Nitrate Vulnerable Zones**
Under Portaria 259/2012 (updated implementation of Directive 91/676/EEC), the designated NVZ areas
in Portugal include major agricultural regions in the Tejo and Sado river basins, the Algarve
coastal plain, and parts of the Norte region. Greenhouse operators in these zones are required to
demonstrate nutrient containment. A continuous EPDM floor membrane with perimeter collection drain,
combined with a monitored cistern, provides documentable compliance with nutrient leaching prevention
requirements under inspection by DRAP (Direções Regionais de Agricultura e Pescas).

**Portuguese agricultural water efficiency policy (PNUEA)**
Portugal's national programme for efficient water use (PNUEA) sets sector targets for agricultural
water efficiency. The programme incentivises investment in water recycling, including the collection
and reuse of drainage and condensate water from protected horticulture facilities. EPDM-lined
collection systems — documented with membrane certifications and installation warranties — provide
the evidence base needed for subsidy applications under PDR2020 (Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural)
and its successor PT2030 agricultural measures.

## EPDM vs Competing Materials in Greenhouse Applications

**EPDM vs polyethylene film (standard greenhouse floor cover):**
Loose-lay polyethylene ground cover film (typically 0.2-0.3 mm black PE, sometimes woven PP) is
the most common greenhouse floor treatment in Portugal. It is a weed suppressant and moisture
barrier but not a true waterproofing membrane — it does not provide the watertight containment
required for NVZ compliance, cannot be reliably seamed, and degrades under UV exposure within
1-4 years. EPDM provides 50+ year service life, true watertight containment, and the root and
chemical resistance that ground cover film cannot offer.

**EPDM vs HDPE geomembrane:**
HDPE (high-density polyethylene) is a cost-competitive alternative for large flat applications
such as cistern bases and reservoir liners. Its limitations in greenhouse applications are thermal
brittleness (HDPE becomes brittle at temperatures below 0°C, which are reached in Portuguese
mountain regions during winter), seaming requirements (thermal welding requiring specialist
equipment), and inflexibility that creates stress concentrations at penetrations and
perimeter details. EPDM is more forgiving in installation and more flexible at cold temperatures.

**EPDM vs concrete waterproofing admixtures and coatings:**
Cementitious waterproofing (applied to concrete gutter and cistern surfaces) and crystalline
admixtures are used in some greenhouse construction. These systems are rigid, brittle, and cannot
bridge cracks that develop in concrete as it settles or thermally cycles. EPDM membranes applied
to concrete surfaces bridge cracks up to several millimetres without loss of waterproofing
integrity.

**EPDM vs bituminous membranes:**
Bituminous waterproofing (torch-applied APP or SBS-modified bitumen) is widely used in Portugal
for general construction waterproofing but is not appropriate for greenhouse floor applications
where the membrane contacts irrigation water or growing media. Bituminous membranes can release
hydrocarbon compounds into contact water, are UV-sensitive without mineral aggregate surfacing,
and are not certified for contact with water intended for agricultural reuse. EPDM is the
appropriate material for all greenhouse water-contact applications.

## Regulatory and Certification Framework

**APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente):** Portugal's national environmental authority oversees
compliance with EU water legislation, including the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and
Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC). Greenhouse operators in regulated catchments must demonstrate
that their facilities do not cause diffuse nutrient pollution of surface or groundwater. EPDM
floor membranes and collection system waterproofing provide the physical infrastructure for
compliant closed-loop nutrient management.

**DRAP (Direções Regionais de Agricultura e Pescas):** Regional agricultural authorities
responsible for inspection of agricultural facilities, administration of rural development
programme subsidies, and enforcement of environmental agricultural legislation. Subsidy
applications for greenhouse investment under PDR2020/PT2030 measures typically require
demonstration of water management compliance. EPDM installation documentation (membrane
certification, installation warranty, water contact approval) provides the required evidence.

**Organic farming certification (NP EN 17510 / EU 2018/848):** EPDM membranes are compatible
with organic production requirements. The EU Organic Regulation (2018/848) requires that materials
in contact with soil, growing media, or water used in organic production do not introduce prohibited
substances or contaminants. EPDM contains no plasticisers, heavy metal compounds, synthetic
biocides, or organohalogen compounds that would conflict with organic certification requirements.
Certification bodies (Ecocert, CERTIS) do not identify EPDM membrane as a prohibited material
in certified organic greenhouse production.
