# Livestock Facilities — EPDM Research Summary

## Sector Overview: Portuguese Livestock Industry

Portugal's livestock sector represents a significant pillar of the national agricultural economy.
According to Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE) data, Portugal has approximately:
- 1.6 million cattle (primarily in the Alentejo, Trás-os-Montes, and Açores)
- 2.3 million pigs (concentrated in the Centro and Alentejo regions)
- 35 million poultry (broilers and layers, across all regions)
- 2.2 million sheep and goats (interior and south)

The sector generates approximately 5.8 million tonnes of livestock effluent annually, of which a
significant proportion requires regulated storage and management under the Diretiva Nitratos
(91/676/CEE, transposed by DL 235/97 and later DL 68/99 and DL 81/2013).

Suinicultura (pig farming) is the most regulation-intensive subsector due to high nitrogen loads
in slurry. The Norte and Centro regions contain the highest density of intensive pig installations
within Portuguese Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (ZVN — Zonas Vulneráveis ao Azoto).

## Key Chemical Challenges in Livestock Environments

### Ammonia (NH₃)
Ammonia is the primary chemical aggressive agent in livestock facilities. Decomposition of
urea in livestock urine produces ammonia through enzymatic hydrolysis. Typical concentrations:
- Slurry lagoons: 2,000-5,000 mg NH₃-N/litre in liquid fraction
- Dairy wash-down water: 200-800 mg NH₃-N/litre
- Piggery wash-down: 500-2,000 mg NH₃-N/litre
- Air concentration in enclosed buildings: up to 50 ppm (OSHA limit: 25 ppm TWA)

EPDM exhibits excellent resistance to ammonia at all livestock-relevant concentrations. Long-term
immersion testing (ASTM D471) shows less than 5% change in tensile strength and less than 8%
change in elongation after 168 hours immersion at 50°C in 10% ammonia solution. This performance
is significantly superior to both HDPE (surface etching noted at elevated concentrations) and
concrete (alkaline attack on cement matrix, progressive porosity).

### Hydrogen Sulphide (H₂S)
Anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in slurry produces hydrogen sulphide. H₂S is:
- Highly toxic (IDLH: 50 ppm; immediately dangerous at 100 ppm)
- Corrosive to copper, mild steel, and some polymers
- Problematic for concrete surfaces through sulphuric acid secondary formation

EPDM exhibits good resistance to H₂S. No evidence of chain scission or plasticiser leaching
(relevant to HDPE comparison) at typical livestock concentrations.

### Slurry pH
Livestock slurry pH varies by species and management:
- Pig slurry (liquid): pH 7.0-8.5 (can reach 9.0 in aerated lagoons)
- Cattle slurry: pH 7.5-8.5
- Poultry litter leachate: pH 8.0-9.5
- Dairy wash-down: pH 6.5-8.0

EPDM is rated for continuous service at pH 4-12, covering all livestock effluent types without
compromise to membrane integrity.

### Biological Attack
Microbial colonisation on membrane surfaces is a documented concern in permanently wet
environments. Research from Wageningen University (Netherlands) on EPDM pond liners in
agricultural use found no significant penetration of biofilm into EPDM bulk material over a
10-year observation period. The smooth vulcanised surface resists adhesion more effectively than
textured HDPE, and the absence of plasticisers removes a potential carbon source for microbes
that would selectively colonise PVC-based membranes.

## Facility Types Requiring Waterproofing

### Slurry Lagoons (Lagoas de Chorume/Estrume Líquido)
The primary regulatory-driven application. Portuguese law requires:
- Minimum storage capacity: 90 days of production (DL 81/2013, Annex)
- For ZVN installations: 180 days minimum in zones with winter application restrictions
- Watertight construction with documented integrity

Lagoon volumes in practice: 200 m³ to 8,000 m³ for intensive farms. EPDM is installed on
compacted earth or concrete bases, with geotextile protection layer and anchored perimeter.

### Manure and Solid Effluent Storage (Estrumeiras)
Covered or open solid manure storage platforms require waterproofed bases to prevent leachate
infiltration. The leachate from solid manure is highly concentrated (COD 5,000-25,000 mg/L)
and must be collected and stored, not allowed to percolate. EPDM lining of concrete estrumeira
bases is increasingly specified to prevent this.

### Drinking Troughs (Bebedouros e Açudes)
Large-capacity water storage for livestock (cattle troughs, water reservoirs for intensive
units). EPDM is certified safe for livestock watering applications — no plasticiser leaching,
no taste or odour transfer at livestock-relevant temperatures.

### Wash-down Collection Areas (Fossas de Lavagem)
Collection pits for wash-down water from milking parlours, piggery aisles, and poultry houses.
Typically 20-200 m³, heavily contaminated with detergents and biological material.

### Biogas Digesters (Digestores de Biogás)
Anaerobic digestion of slurry is growing in Portugal under PNEC 2030 incentives. EPDM membranes
are used for digester gas-holder covers (floating gas storage) and for lagoon covers that double
as gas collection systems. The membrane must resist methane (CH₄), CO₂, and trace H₂S in the
biogas mixture.

## Regulatory Framework — Portugal

### DL 81/2013 — Gestão de Efluentes Pecuários
The core regulatory instrument. Requires all farms above thresholds to:
- Submit a Plano de Gestão de Efluentes Pecuários (PGEP)
- Maintain storage capacity meeting minimum periods
- Demonstrate effluent containment to DRAP (Direcção Regional de Agricultura e Pescas)

Threshold for obligatory PGEP: ≥ 10 Capitais Animais (animal equivalents).

### Diretiva Nitratos (91/676/CEE) — Portuguese Implementation
Transposed as DL 235/97 (initial) and subsequent revisions. Designates Nitrate Vulnerable Zones
(ZVN) where stricter application and storage rules apply. Farms in ZVN must:
- Store 180 days of production (not 90 days)
- Keep records of effluent application
- Apply effluent only within permitted periods

ZVN in Portugal include parts of: Ria de Aveiro, Baixo Mondego, Lezíria do Tejo, Lower Alentejo,
Algarve (Barlavento and Sotavento aquifer zones).

### DRAP Licensing
Regional agricultural directorates (DRAPC, DRAP Alentejo, DRAP Norte, etc.) issue licences for
livestock facilities. Environmental compliance of slurry storage is a mandatory licensing condition.
EPDM membrane systems with documented installation and integrity testing are accepted as proof of
compliance by all DRAPs.

### Licenciamento Zero / SIR (Sistema de Indústria Responsável)
Larger pig and poultry farms may fall under the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED/BREF for
Intensive Livestock) and require integrated environmental licensing. EPDM effluent containment
is compatible with BAT (Best Available Technique) requirements for slurry storage.
