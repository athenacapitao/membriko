# Livestock Facility Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## The Portuguese Livestock Sector and Its Waterproofing Challenges

Portugal operates a substantial livestock sector: 1.6 million cattle, 2.3 million pigs, 35 million poultry, and 2.2 million sheep and goats. These operations generate approximately 5.8 million tonnes of effluent annually — liquid slurry, solid manure, wash-down water — which Portuguese law requires to be stored and managed in an environmentally safe manner. This is not a question of good agricultural practice; it is a legal obligation with concrete consequences.

Decree-Law 81/2013 establishes that all livestock operations above ten animal equivalents must hold an approved Livestock Effluent Management Plan (PGEP — Plano de Gestão de Efluentes Pecuários), with effluent storage systems that are demonstrably watertight. Operations located in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (ZVN — Zonas Vulneráveis ao Azoto) are subject to even stricter requirements. Non-compliance is not a theoretical possibility: the APA (Portuguese Environment Agency) and the regional agricultural directorates (DRAPs) inspect and enforce, with fines reaching €100,000 per infraction and licence suspension as a further sanction.

Membriko, based in Pombal and specialising exclusively in EPDM membrane application, works directly with farm owners, agricultural engineers, and project designers to ensure that effluent storage structures meet legal requirements, perform reliably for decades, and are documented correctly for licensing purposes. This document explains how — with data, with engineering, and with the knowledge of a company that installs membranes in agricultural contexts across Portugal.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Membrane for Livestock Facilities

The choice of waterproofing material in a livestock context cannot be made on price alone. The chemical environment of slurry lagoons, wash-down pits, and biogas digesters is one of the most aggressive that exists for construction materials — more demanding than most industrial environments and incomparably more demanding than any building waterproofing application.

### Intrinsic Chemical Resistance

The primary polymer chain of EPDM is composed of ethylene and propylene units joined by single C-C bonds. This saturation is decisive: the single bonds are chemically stable and are not susceptible to attack by ammonia, organic acids, hydrogen sulphide, nitrogenous compounds, or the cleaning and disinfection solutions used in livestock settings. This is not a surface treatment; it is the molecular architecture of the vulcanised elastomer that confers this resistance.

Immersion testing to ASTM D471 confirms that EPDM membrane retains more than 95% of its tensile strength and more than 92% of its elongation after 168 hours of immersion at 50°C in 10% ammonia solution — conditions considerably more severe than those encountered in any slurry lagoon. This is a performance level that neither reinforced concrete nor plasticised PVC can match.

EPDM operates continuously at pH 4 to 12, covering all livestock effluents: pig slurry (pH 7-8.5), cattle slurry (pH 7.5-8.5), poultry manure leachate (pH 8-9.5), and wash-down water contaminated with alkaline disinfectants (pH up to 12).

### No Plasticisers to Migrate

One of the less-discussed problems with PVC waterproofing in livestock contexts is plasticiser migration. Plasticised PVC contains 30-50% by weight of phthalate or adipate plasticisers that are not chemically bonded to the polymer matrix. In an ammonia-laden, elevated-temperature environment — typical conditions in a slurry lagoon on a Portuguese summer day — this migration is accelerated. The result is a membrane that progressively loses flexibility, contracts, and cracks — precisely where it cannot afford to fail.

EPDM contains no plasticisers. Its flexibility is a property of the vulcanised elastomer network, not of an additive that depletes over time. A Membriko EPDM membrane installed thirty years ago has the same chemical composition it had on installation day. Slurry does not degrade it, ammonia does not embrittle it, and summer heat does not strip it of the mechanical properties that guarantee containment.

### Longevity That Justifies the Investment

A slurry lagoon is a long-duration infrastructure asset. It is rare for a livestock operation to be built with a projected lifespan of under thirty years. EPDM, with a documented service life of 40 to 50 years, is the only waterproofing material that will not require replacement over the normal operating life of a livestock installation. A single installation by Membriko — with our 15-year guarantee — for the entire working life of the farm.

### Confirmed Regulatory Acceptance

Membriko works regularly with the DRAPs (regional agricultural directorates) from north to south of Portugal. EPDM membrane waterproofing systems, accompanied by technical documentation conforming to EN 13956 and an installation certificate, are accepted by licensing authorities as a valid effluent containment solution. The documentation package that Membriko provides after each installation — technical specification, georeferenced photographic record of all installation stages, watertightness test result, and 15-year guarantee certificate — is the supporting evidence that PGEP approval requires.

## Livestock Facility Types — All EPDM Applications

Livestock facility waterproofing is not limited to slurry lagoons. Membriko covers the full range of water and effluent storage structures on a modern livestock operation.

### Slurry and Liquid Manure Lagoons

The primary and most regulated application. DL 81/2013 requires that slurry lagoons be constructed or lined to guarantee zero infiltration into the soil and groundwater. Lagoon volumes range from 200 m³ on small family cattle farms to over 8,000 m³ on intensive pig farms in the Alentejo.

The Membriko system for slurry lagoons comprises: a 300 g/m² (or 500 g/m² for stony ground) non-woven polypropylene geotextile on the compacted substrate; 1.5 mm EPDM membrane (lagoons up to 2,000 m³) or 2.0 mm (larger lagoons or irregular terrain); minimum 200 mm overlap at all seams, vulcanised with certified EPDM seam tape; perimeter anchoring by anchor trench with a minimum depth of 300 mm. Optionally, a floating EPDM cover for ammonia emission reduction and biogas collection.

### Manure Stores — Solid Effluent Storage

Manure stores — platforms for solid manure storage from cattle, sheep, or poultry operations — generate highly concentrated leachate (COD 5,000-25,000 mg/L) that must be collected and must not infiltrate the soil. EPDM installed on the base and side walls of the manure store, with a perimeter collection channel and collection sump connected to the lagoon, guarantees total containment and enables the leachate to be recovered as fertiliser-value effluent.

Membriko installs the system on existing concrete bases (cleaning, crack repair, EPDM with mechanical perimeter fixing) or on new compacted earth bases with geotextile protection. The perimeter channel and collection sump are waterproofed in the same installation process.

### Livestock Drinking Troughs and Water Reservoirs

Water storage for livestock watering requires materials certified as safe for contact with animal drinking water. EPDM contains no plasticisers or compounds that could migrate into the water and affect animal health or production quality. Membriko uses EPDM formulations compatible with water storage for animal drinking water quality — no taste, no odour, no transfer of harmful compounds.

Applications include: large-capacity cattle drinking troughs and reservoirs (5,000-50,000 litres); distribution reservoirs for automated drinking systems in pig units and poultry houses; storage tanks for water systems shared between irrigation and farm cleaning uses.

### Wash-Down Collection Pits and Effluent Recovery

Collection pits for wash-down water from milking parlours, pig house aisles, and poultry buildings concentrate effluent with high chemical load: detergents, disinfectants (hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, quaternary ammonium compounds), biological residues, and dilute slurry. This mixture is aggressive to conventional materials.

EPDM resists all standard agricultural cleaning and disinfection products. Membriko installs wash-down pits in existing concrete (interior rehabilitation without demolition) or new compacted earth construction, with an effluent extraction system and documentation for the PGEP file.

### Anaerobic Digesters and Biogas Systems

Agricultural biogas from livestock slurry is a growing reality in Portugal under the PNEC 2030 objectives. EPDM is the preferred material for floating covers on digester lagoons, where the membrane serves a dual role: containment of the effluent under digestion and collector/storage of the biogas mixture (CH₄, CO₂, trace H₂S). Membriko installs floating EPDM cover systems dimensioned for biogas pressures, with a gas extraction point, safety relief valve, and inspection access.

## Chemical Resistance — What EPDM Withstands That Concrete and HDPE Cannot

### Ammonia: The Primary Aggressor in Livestock Facilities

Ammonia is the decomposition product of animal urea and is present in all livestock effluents. Typical concentrations range from 200-800 mg NH₃-N/L in cattle wash-down water to 2,000-5,000 mg NH₃-N/L in the liquid fraction of pig slurry. In building air, concentrations in inadequately ventilated pig housing can reach 50 ppm — the OSHA occupational exposure limit.

For reinforced concrete, ammonia is a serious aggressor. The ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) reacts with the calcium silicate hydrates in the cement paste (reacting with Ca(OH)₂ to form calcium nitrate and an ammonium salt), progressively destroying the binding matrix. Concrete in unprotected slurry lagoons develops increasing porosity, exudes lime, and loses mechanical integrity over 10 to 20 years — well before the end of the expected useful life of the farming installation.

EPDM has no chemical reaction with NH₃ or NH₄⁺. The ethylene-propylene backbone has no functional groups that react with ammonia. Immersion testing confirms less than 5% change in mechanical properties after prolonged exposure at concentrations far exceeding those found in livestock settings.

### Hydrogen Sulphide (H₂S)

Hydrogen sulphide is produced by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in slurry lagoons. It is extremely toxic (IDLH: 50 ppm; immediately life-threatening at 100 ppm), heavier than air (accumulating in pits and low points), and corrosive to metals and concrete. Secondary degradation of H₂S on moist concrete generates sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) through bacterial action, causing severe acid attack on the concrete matrix.

EPDM exhibits good resistance to H₂S at the concentrations found in livestock facilities (below 500 ppm). No mechanical degradation has been documented in EPDM membranes in prolonged contact with the gas phase of slurry lagoons.

### pH and Organic Compounds

Livestock slurry has pH between 7 and 9.5 depending on species and management system. Poultry manure leachates can reach pH 9-10. Sodium hydroxide cleaning solutions used in milking parlours can briefly reach pH 12-13.

EPDM has a continuous service rating of pH 4 to 12, and short-term resistance (under 4 hours) to pH 13. This covers all livestock chemical exposure scenarios. Concrete, by contrast, suffers alkaline leaching attack above pH 9 (dissolution of Ca(OH)₂ from cement paste) and acid attack below pH 5.

## Installation Process for Livestock Facilities

Installing EPDM membrane in livestock contexts requires specific technical competence — not only in membrane application, but in substrate diagnosis, regulatory sizing, and compliance documentation. Membriko has an established process for each phase.

### 1. Diagnosis and Design

Before any installation, Membriko carries out a technical site visit to the farm. The diagnostic assessment covers: substrate evaluation (soil, existing concrete, embankment slopes); water table depth and hydrostatic uplift risk; confirmation of dimensions and volumes against PGEP requirements; identification of constraints for floating cover installation; and definition of the membrane specification (thickness, formulation for the specific chemical environment). The output is a technical design that supports both construction execution and the licensing process with the DRAP.

### 2. Substrate Preparation

The longevity of the EPDM membrane depends critically on the quality of substrate preparation. For earth-compacted lagoons: compaction to ≥ 95% modified Proctor; levelling of base and embankment slopes; removal of stones, roots, and any sharp objects; installation of 300-500 g/m² protective geotextile. For existing concrete substrates: hydrojetting cleaning; crack repair with epoxy mortar; chamfering of all sharp edges to ensure membrane continuity without stress concentrations.

### 3. EPDM Membrane Installation

EPDM panels are unrolled and positioned to minimise the number of seams, prioritising coverage of the base before the embankment slopes. All seams have a minimum 200 mm overlap, with EPDM vulcanising seam tape applied after surface cleaning with primer. Seams are pressed with a rubber roller to ensure complete adhesion. Penetration details — drainage outlets, pumping inlets, heat exchangers — are executed using factory-vulcanised EPDM moulded pieces, ensuring perfect geometry and the absence of stress-concentrating folds.

### 4. Perimeter Anchoring

Anchoring the membrane at the upper edge of the lagoon is one of the most critical operations of the installation. Membriko uses an anchor trench with a minimum depth of 300 mm, backfilled with concrete after the folded membrane is introduced. On concrete structures, anchoring is achieved with a 50×6 mm stainless steel flat bar screwed at 200 mm centres into drilled fixings, sealed with silicone sealant at the membrane-structure interface. The anchoring system is dimensioned to resist hydrostatic uplift pressure from biogas (where applicable) and wind pressure on the free membrane edge.

### 5. Floating Cover (Optional)

Membriko's floating EPDM cover system is installed on lagoons where ammonia emission reduction is a priority (inhabited zones, ZVN operations with emission constraints) or where biogas collection is desired. The cover floats on the slurry surface, anchored at the perimeter by a guide cable system that allows vertical movement with level changes. A central gas collector connects to the biogas outlet, which can be routed to a safe flaring torch or to an electricity-generating engine. The cover reduces atmospheric NH₃ emissions by 70-90%.

### 6. Watertightness Testing and Documentation

After complete installation, Membriko carries out a hydraulic integrity test: filling with water, 24-hour stabilisation, level readings at start and end of the monitoring period. The test result is documented in a signed technical report. The final documentation package includes: EPDM membrane technical specification (manufacturer data sheet, CE performance declaration), georeferenced photographic record of all installation phases, watertightness test result, and 15-year guarantee certificate issued by Membriko. This package is the supporting evidence that PGEP approval and DRAP licensing require.

## Effluent Containment Legislation — What the Law Requires from Your Operation

Portuguese livestock effluent management legislation is specific, technical, and actively enforced. Many producers are not fully aware of the detail of what is required.

### DL 81/2013 — The Central Regulatory Framework

Decree-Law 81/2013 (as amended by DL 65/2019) governs the management of livestock effluents. The core requirements are:

- **PGEP obligation threshold:** ≥ 10 Animal Equivalents (Capitais Animais). Below this threshold, good agricultural practice guidelines apply; above it, an approved PGEP is mandatory.
- **Minimum storage capacity:** 90 days of effluent production for operations outside ZVN; 180 days for operations within ZVN.
- **Documented watertightness:** The PGEP must include documentary evidence of the impermeability of storage structures. A technical memorandum accompanied by the Membriko membrane data sheet and installation report satisfies this requirement.
- **Prohibition of storage in leaking structures:** Any operation where the DRAP identifies leaks in effluent storage structures is notified for immediate remediation.

### Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (ZVN)

Portugal has designated several ZVNs under the Nitrates Directive. The principal zones include:
- Ria de Aveiro (Centre region)
- Baixo Mondego (Centre region)
- Lezíria do Tejo and Vale do Sorraia (Lisbon and Tagus Valley)
- Campo Branco (Alentejo)
- Barlavento and Sotavento Algarve (groundwater protection zones)

In ZVNs, in addition to the 180-day storage requirement, restrictions apply to the timing of effluent application (prohibition of application during defined winter periods in most zones) and maximum nitrogen load per hectare. Adequate storage capacity is not only a legal requirement — it is an operational necessity to accumulate effluent through application restriction periods.

### How Membriko Documentation Supports Licensing

Membriko provides with each installation a complete documentation package that designers and producers need for PGEP approval at the DRAP:

1. EPDM membrane technical data sheet (EN 13956, CE performance declaration)
2. Installation technical memorandum (system description, thickness, seam overlaps)
3. Georeferenced photographic record (before, during, and after installation)
4. Documented hydraulic watertightness test result
5. Membriko guarantee certificate (15 years)
6. Technical support for responding to DRAP queries during assessment phase

## EPDM vs HDPE vs Reinforced Concrete — An Honest Technical Comparison

Membriko acknowledges that HDPE and reinforced concrete are legitimate alternatives that continue to be specified in Portugal. This comparison explains why Membriko chooses exclusively EPDM for livestock applications.

### EPDM vs Reinforced Concrete

Concrete is the oldest and most intuitive alternative for effluent lagoons. Its weaknesses in livestock contexts are documented and substantial:

- **Cracking:** Concrete cracks through shrinkage, differential settlement, and thermal cycling. A 0.3 mm crack in a slurry lagoon wall is a pathway for soil and groundwater contamination — and is extremely difficult to detect and repair without complete emptying. Legislation does not accept "acceptable cracks" in effluent containment structures.
- **Ammonia attack:** As described above, the ammonium ion progressively degrades the cement matrix over years. Concrete lagoons in intensive pig operations typically require intervention at 15-20 years.
- **Whole-life cost:** The initial cost of concrete may be comparable to EPDM in large volumes. The whole-life cost — including maintenance, crack repairs, and eventual rehabilitation — is consistently higher.
- **No integrated floating cover:** Concrete has no equivalent floating cover system to EPDM.

### EPDM vs HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)

HDPE is the most directly comparable alternative to EPDM in terms of application. Membriko recognises its strengths:

- **Chemical resistance:** HDPE has good resistance to ammonia and livestock slurry — comparable to EPDM for most compounds.
- **Stiffness and elongation:** HDPE has elongation below 10%, compared with 300-400% for EPDM. If the substrate of an HDPE-lined lagoon settles differentially, the membrane cannot adapt — cracking or seam separation is the likely outcome.
- **Field welding:** HDPE seams require hot-fusion welding with specialist equipment and trained, certified operators. An incorrectly executed HDPE field seam is as reliable an infiltration pathway as a concrete crack. Membriko's EPDM seams, executed with vulcanising tape by trained technicians, require no heating equipment and allow immediate visual verification.
- **Damage repair:** A puncture in HDPE (from an animal hoof, a tool, or a sub-surface stone) requires hot-weld patch repair — difficult to execute in the field on an operating lagoon. An EPDM puncture is repaired with a cold-vulcanising patch kit in 30 minutes.
- **Installed cost per m²:** HDPE in large lagoons has a cost per m² competitive with EPDM. The cost differential emerges over the service life (HDPE: 20-30 years; EPDM: 40-50 years) and in the repair cost for accidental damage.

---

## Environmental Compliance — Nitrates Directive, PNEC 2030 and Beyond

Livestock sector environmental regulation is on a trajectory of increasing stringency. Operations that invest now in long-duration compliant solutions avoid regulatory adaptation costs over the next 20-30 years.

### The Nitrates Directive and ZVN Review

Council Directive 91/676/EEC — the Nitrates Directive — commits the European Union to protecting waters against pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources. Portugal reviews its ZVN designations periodically, and the trend is towards expansion as the condition of groundwater bodies is assessed more rigorously. Operations currently outside ZVN may find themselves within new designations at the next review. Having a lagoon with documented, warranted waterproofing is the strongest protection against this regulatory contingency.

### PNEC 2030 and Agricultural Biogas

Portugal's National Energy and Climate Plan (PNEC 2030) includes specific targets for agricultural biogas, with grid injection tariffs and installation support for anaerobic digesters. The Membriko EPDM floating cover membrane is the technically correct solution for:
- Floating covers on slurry digesters (biogas collection)
- Post-digestion lagoons with floating covers (residual biogas collection)
- Digestate storage lagoon waterproofing

Membriko has accumulated experience in agricultural biogas projects and can advise on membrane system compatibility with biogas extraction and utilisation equipment.

### IED — Industrial Emissions Directive

Larger operations (above the Annex I thresholds of the IED: 40,000 poultry, 2,000 production pigs, or 750 breeding sows) are subject to integrated licensing under the Industrial Emissions Directive and the Intensive Livestock BREF document. The BAT reference documents for this sector include effluent containment requirements that Membriko EPDM waterproofing with full documentation satisfies entirely.

## Maintenance of EPDM-Lined Livestock Lagoons and Facilities

One of the greatest practical advantages of EPDM membrane in livestock facilities is the simplicity of maintenance. Membriko recommends the following annual maintenance protocol:

**Annual visual inspection:** Check of the membrane surface visible at the upper edge of the lagoon (above the submerged zone) for any physical damage from equipment or animals. Inspection of the anchor trench and perimeter edge integrity. Inspection for any abnormal bulging or deformation of a floating cover.

**Cleaning:** EPDM is compatible with all standard livestock cleaning and disinfection products — alkaline detergents, weak acids, quaternary ammonium disinfectants, dilute hydrogen peroxide. Prolonged direct contact with concentrated petroleum solvents should be avoided.

**Accidental damage repair:** Accidental punctures (from animal hooves, farm tools, or sub-surface stones migrating under the membrane) are repaired with a cold-vulcanising EPDM patch kit — applied without heat, without specialist equipment, in 30-45 minutes. Membriko supplies repair kits with each installation and offers a repair service with documentation for the PGEP maintenance file.

**Maintenance records:** Membriko offers an annual technical inspection visit with a condition assessment report — a document of additional value for the PGEP file and for DRAP inspections.

## Portuguese Livestock Regulations — Practical Guide for DRAP Licensing

Membriko works with producers and designers throughout the licensing process. Knowledge of the regulatory bodies and procedures is a service we provide as an integral part of each project.

**Regional DRAPs and relevant contacts:**
- DRAP Norte (Porto): competence for Trás-os-Montes, Minho, Douro
- DRAPC (Coimbra): competence for Beiras, Dão-Lafões
- DRAPLVT (Lisbon): competence for Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Ribatejo
- DRAP Alentejo (Évora): competence for Alto and Baixo Alentejo
- DRAP Algarve (Faro): competence for the Algarve region

**Typical licensing timeline for a new lagoon:**
- Application submission and documentation delivery to DRAP: week 1
- DRAP file processing: 4-8 weeks
- Technical site inspection (for larger installations): weeks 8-12
- PGEP approval: weeks 10-16 (depending on DRAP workload)
- Start of construction and membrane installation: after approval

Membriko can begin technical preparation — design, specification, materials quantification — in parallel with the licensing process, minimising the interval between approval and installation completion.

## Biogas Integration — The New Frontier for Livestock Facilities

Agricultural biogas is one of the PNEC 2030 priorities and a concrete economic opportunity for farms with sufficient effluent volumes. Pig slurry yields 20-30 m³ of biogas per tonne (methane content: 60-70%); cattle slurry yields 10-15 m³/tonne. An intensive pig unit of 2,000 animals can generate 300,000-500,000 m³ of biogas per year — sufficient energy for on-farm self-consumption and grid export.

Membriko installs the floating EPDM cover system that transforms a conventional slurry lagoon into an integrated storage and biogas collection system. The system operates on pressure differential: biogas produced by anaerobic decomposition lifts the floating cover, creating a gas chamber between the slurry surface and the membrane. A gas collector at the highest point of the cover extracts the biogas to the utilisation pipework.

Membriko coordinates with the biogas project designer (digester sizing, CHP engine, purification system) to ensure the floating cover is dimensioned and installed to match the utilisation system specification. EPDM is compatible with biogas (CH₄, CO₂, trace H₂S) — validated in installations in service for over ten years of continuous operation.

---

## Health and Safety in Livestock Facilities — Responsibility Membriko Takes Seriously

Livestock environments, particularly slurry lagoons and digesters, present serious health and safety hazards that Membriko integrates into installation procedures.

**Hydrogen Sulphide (H₂S):** H₂S is produced by anaerobic decomposition and accumulates in lower layers of closed lagoons and pits. It is odourless at concentrations above 100 ppm (because it paralyses the olfactory nerve) and rapidly fatal above 300 ppm. Entry into confined spaces containing slurry requires a confined space entry procedure: atmospheric monitoring, forced ventilation, respiratory protective equipment, and a surface attendant with a rescue plan.

**Ammonia (NH₃):** Concentrations above 25 ppm cause airway irritation (ACGIH TLV-TWA: 25 ppm). In enclosed pig houses with inadequate ventilation, concentrations can reach 50 ppm. All Membriko personnel working in these environments are trained and equipped for atmospheric monitoring.

**EPDM membrane contribution to farm safety:** Installation of a floating EPDM cover reduces lagoon NH₃ atmospheric emissions by 70-90%, substantially improving the working environment for farm operators. Total effluent containment eliminates H₂S infiltration into the soil and any potential accumulation in adjacent underground spaces.

Membriko complies with Portuguese occupational health and safety legislation for agricultural work (Portaria 243/2011) and confined space regulations (Lei 102/2009 and NP 1796:2007) in all livestock facility installations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Portuguese legislation require slurry lagoon waterproofing?

Yes, unambiguously. Decree-Law 81/2013 requires that all livestock operations with ten or more Animal Equivalents hold an approved Livestock Effluent Management Plan (PGEP) that includes documentary evidence of the watertightness of all effluent storage structures. The DRAP verifies this requirement in new licensing applications and during inspections of existing operations. Inadequate waterproofing is grounds for a rectification notice and, where documented aquifer contamination has occurred, can result in fines ranging from €1,500 to €100,000.

### Is EPDM accepted by the DRAPs and APA as a valid effluent containment solution?

Yes. Membriko works regularly with DRAPs across all regions of Portugal, and EPDM membrane waterproofing systems accompanied by conformance documentation to EN 13956 are accepted as a valid effluent containment solution by licensing authorities. The critical element is documentation: manufacturer data sheet, CE performance declaration, installation technical memorandum, photographic record, and watertightness test result — all of which Membriko provides after each installation.

### What EPDM membrane thickness is recommended for slurry lagoons?

Membriko specifies 1.5 mm for lagoons up to 2,000 m³ with well-compacted earth substrate and 300 g/m² geotextile protection. For larger lagoons, stony ground, or irregular terrain with pronounced embankment slopes, we specify 2.0 mm for additional puncture protection. For concrete lagoon rehabilitation — where EPDM is installed as interior lining on an existing structure — 1.5 mm is generally sufficient since the rigid substrate eliminates the risk of puncture from substrate settlement.

### Can EPDM be installed inside an existing concrete lagoon that is leaking?

Yes — this is one of the most frequent Membriko applications in livestock contexts. Interior rehabilitation with EPDM without demolition of the concrete structure is both technically effective and economically superior to reconstruction. The process includes: draining and cleaning the lagoon; repairing larger concrete cracks with epoxy mortar (smaller cracks are bridged by EPDM's elongation); installing EPDM with perimeter stainless steel mechanical anchoring; and a documented watertightness test. The result is a lagoon with immediate regulatory compliance and a 15-year Membriko guarantee.

### Does the floating EPDM cover function as a biogas collection system?

Yes. Membriko's floating EPDM cover system is specifically designed to operate in a dual role: reduction of atmospheric ammonia emissions and collection of biogas produced by slurry under anaerobic digestion. The cover floats on the surface, creating a pressurised gas chamber. A central gas collector routes the biogas to the utilisation system (safety flare, CHP engine, boiler). The system is compatible with PNEC 2030 objectives and may qualify for available agricultural biogas support incentives.

### How long does an EPDM membrane last in permanent contact with slurry?

The documented service life of EPDM membrane under chemical immersion conditions is 40 to 50 years with correct installation. This estimate is based on field data from lagoons in service in Europe — the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom — with over 25 years of operation, and on accelerated ageing tests using Arrhenius methodology. Membriko offers a 15-year guarantee on each installation — the longest available in the Portuguese market for this type of application.

### My operation is in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone — what changes in practice?

In ZVNs, the mandatory storage capacity increases from 90 to 180 days of effluent production. Application timing restrictions also apply — prohibition of effluent application during defined autumn and winter periods in most ZVNs — which further increases the need for storage capacity to accumulate effluent through restricted application windows. Membriko can calculate the storage volume required for your ZVN operation and dimension the waterproofing system accordingly.

### Is EPDM safe for drinking troughs and animal water storage?

Yes. EPDM membrane contains no plasticisers, residual solvents, or other compounds that could migrate into the water and affect animal health or production quality. Membriko uses EPDM formulations comparable to those used in human drinking water reservoirs — no taste, no odour, no detectable transfer of harmful compounds at normal service temperatures. For animal drinking water applications, Membriko can provide the specific material data sheet with a declaration of absence of harmful migratable substances.
