# Shed and Garage Roofing (Coberturas de Barracões e Garagens) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Sheds, garages, garden shelters, workshops, carports and agricultural annexes represent the
largest volume category of small-scale roofing in Portugal, yet they receive the least
engineering attention. The dominant roofing materials for these structures are economy bituminous
felt (feltro betuminoso de baixo custo), corrugated fibre-cement (fibrocimento ondulado), corrugated
galvanised steel (chapa ondulada galvanizada), and corrugated bituminous panels (chapa betuminosa
ondulada). All four share the same fundamental weakness: a service life of 10 to 25 years at best,
followed by costly removal and replacement cycles that accumulate over the lifetime of the structure.

EPDM is emerging as the technically and economically superior alternative for all flat and
mono-pitch outbuilding roofs in Portugal. The combination of cold installation (no gas torch
required), single-sheet coverage (no seams on roofs up to 6.1 m wide), compatibility with timber,
metal and concrete substrates, and a proven service life exceeding 50 years makes it uniquely suited
to this market segment. The DIY-accessible nature of EPDM is a secondary but commercially important
factor: for small structures under 30 m², a confident homeowner can achieve a professional-quality
result with the correct kit, reducing cost and expanding the addressable market beyond trade channels.

## EPDM Physical Properties Relevant to Outbuilding Roofs

The physical characteristics of EPDM that are most relevant to shed and garage applications
differ slightly in emphasis from those for commercial flat roofs:

**Substrate compatibility:** Outbuilding roofs are constructed from a wide variety of materials —
OSB board, tongue-and-groove timber planking, corrugated steel, corrugated fibre-cement, concrete,
asbestos-cement (older structures), and aluminium sheeting. EPDM bonds with neoprene contact
adhesive to all non-porous substrates (metal, existing bitumen) and with primer and neoprene adhesive
to porous substrates (timber, OSB, concrete). This universality eliminates the substrate-selection
constraint that limits other systems.

**Single-sheet coverage:** EPDM rolls are manufactured in widths up to 6.1 m and lengths up to
61 m from a single factory-produced sheet. A 4 x 6 m garage roof can be covered with a single piece
requiring no seams in the field — eliminating the highest-risk feature of traditional built-up
systems. This is unique among waterproofing membranes at comparable price points.

**Cold installation:** Unlike bituminous felt applied with a gas torch, EPDM is installed cold using
contact adhesive and seam tape. No open flame is introduced near timber structures, which is a
significant safety advantage. In Portugal, the majority of residential outbuilding structures include
timber roof decking, making cold-applied systems preferable from an insurance, safety and regulatory
perspective.

**Weight:** EPDM at 1.0 mm weighs approximately 1.1-1.3 kg/m². A fully bonded EPDM installation
adds negligible dead load to the roof structure, which is important for lightweight shed and garage
frames not designed to carry ballast.

**UV and thermal resistance:** Outbuilding roofs are often uninsulated, meaning the membrane
surface reaches significantly higher temperatures than insulated building roofs — in southern
Portugal, surface temperatures on black EPDM facing south can exceed 80°C in peak summer. EPDM's
continuous service ceiling of +130°C (peak to +150°C) provides a comfortable safety margin. At
the cold extreme, EPDM remains flexible to -45°C, relevant for garages in Trás-os-Montes and
Serra da Estrela.

## Portuguese Garage and Outbuilding Construction Context

Portuguese residential garages and annexes fall broadly into three construction categories:

**Attached garages (garagem integrada):** Built as part of the main dwelling or as an attached
structure sharing one or more walls. These tend to be masonry or reinforced concrete construction
with a flat or near-flat concrete slab roof. Waterproofing failures here are particularly costly
because water infiltration typically affects the habitable space above or adjacent to the garage.
EPDM on an attached garage roof is effectively the same application as a residential flat roof,
and all the same specification guidance applies.

**Detached concrete garages (garagem independente em betão):** Common throughout suburban and
rural Portugal, particularly in houses built between 1970 and 2000. These are typically single-skin
masonry walls with a concrete or hollow-pot (laje aligeirada) roof slab, often with minimal slope
(0-2%). The original waterproofing was frequently applied bituminous membrane (tela asfáltica) which
has typically reached end of life. EPDM is the optimal renovation material: it can be installed
directly over the existing degraded membrane without removal, reducing cost and waste.

**Timber-framed sheds and shelters (barracões e alpendres em madeira):** Very common as garden
sheds, carports, wood stores and livestock shelters. Roof decking is typically OSB or rough-sawn
timber boards. These represent the primary DIY-accessible EPDM market. A 3 x 4 m shed roof can
be waterproofed with a single 4 x 5 m EPDM sheet, a tin of bonding adhesive and 30 minutes of
work for an experienced installer (or 2-3 hours for a first-time DIY installation).

## Common Roofing Failures for Outbuildings in Portugal

### Economy Bituminous Felt (Feltro Betuminoso Económico)

The most common first-fit material for timber-framed sheds. Typically sold in 1 m wide rolls and
applied in overlapping courses with galvanised clout nails. Lifespan: 5-10 years under Portuguese
UV conditions. Failure modes: UV oxidation causes surface granule loss and crack propagation;
nail holes become entry points as felt contracts thermally; overlapping seam joints open as felt
shrinks. Typically fails first at ridge and eaves where thermal movement is greatest. Cannot be
repaired effectively — when one area fails, the entire felt is compromised.

### Corrugated Fibre-Cement (Fibrocimento Ondulado)

Used extensively from the 1960s to 1990s on agricultural buildings, garages and industrial units.
Asbestos-cement (fibrocimento com amianto) sheets were the standard product until the Portuguese
ban on asbestos in 1993 (Decreto-Lei 101/2005 eventually established the regulatory framework for
existing asbestos removal). Modern fibre-cement is asbestos-free but retains the same lifespan
limitations: algae and lichen colonisation within 5-10 years; joint sealant failure allowing water
ingress at overlaps; fixings corrode and loosen; sheets become porous and fragile over 20-30 years.

Asbestos-cement sheets present a particular challenge for renovation — they cannot simply be
overlaid with EPDM without addressing the health and safety requirements for working with asbestos-
containing materials, which in Portugal requires a certified removal contractor and proper disposal
at an approved facility (PERIGO DE AMIANTO protocols per DL 266/2007).

### Corrugated Galvanised Steel (Chapa Ondulada Galvanizada)

Lifespan of 20-30 years with maintenance, significantly less in coastal saline environments where
zinc depletion accelerates. Primary failure modes: rust through after zinc depletion, particularly
at fixings and cut edges; noise amplification in rain; thermal expansion causes joint movement and
sealant failure. EPDM can be installed over sound galvanised sheet, using mechanical fasteners at
the corrugation crests rather than adhesive (adhesive on corrugated profiles is impractical without
filling the troughs).

### Corrugated Bituminous Panels (Onduline and equivalents)

Lighter than fibre-cement, with a bitumen-impregnated cellulose matrix. Typical lifespan 15-25
years under Portuguese conditions. Subject to UV degradation, delamination at cut edges, and
fixings pulling through the relatively soft panel under wind uplift. A known failure pattern in
Atlantic coastal areas where storm gusts regularly exceed 80 km/h.

## DIY vs Professional EPDM Installation for Outbuildings

EPDM is the only professional waterproofing membrane system that manufacturers explicitly approve
for competent DIY installation on small structures. The UK and German markets have well-established
DIY EPDM kit channels (ClassicBond, RubberBond, Firestone HomeSeries), and the Portuguese market
is following this trend.

**Structures suited to DIY EPDM installation:**
- Flat or mono-pitch roofs under 30 m² with simple rectangular plan
- No penetrations or complex upstand details
- Accessible OSB, plywood or existing flat bituminous surface
- Roof pitch under 15° (steeper pitches require mechanical fastening at edges)

**Structures requiring professional installation:**
- Any garage roof integrated with or directly beneath habitable space
- Roofs with multiple penetrations (vent pipes, drainage, fixings)
- Asbestos-cement substrates (professional removal required first)
- Roofs over 50 m² where seaming is unavoidable
- Mono-pitch structures with parapet walls or complex edge details
- Any installation requiring warranty documentation for mortgage or insurance purposes

The cost differential between DIY and professional installation narrows significantly once tool
hire, adhesive waste, and the probability of a call-back visit for corrections are included.
Membriko's professional installation for a 20 m² shed roof typically completes in 3-4 hours with
two technicians and includes a 20-year warranty — a realistic comparison to a full DIY day.

## Ventilation Considerations for Garages

Garages in Portugal are not required to be thermally insulated to residential standards. However,
two ventilation issues arise specifically from EPDM installation on garage roofs:

**Condensation under impermeable membranes:** Where an uninsulated concrete garage slab is
waterproofed with EPDM and the underside of the slab is exposed to the heated garage interior,
temperature differences can drive interstitial condensation within the slab over winter. This is
rarely a structural problem but can manifest as visible dampness on the slab soffit. The solution
is a vapour control layer at the warm side of the slab (interior face), not modification of the
EPDM above.

**Summer heat buildup:** Black EPDM on an uninsulated roof increases radiant heat gain into the
garage interior. For garages used as workshops or storage for temperature-sensitive materials,
a 50 mm layer of EPS or PIR insulation between deck and membrane significantly improves interior
comfort without structural implications. Alternatively, a cool-roof EPDM variant with an SRI
(Solar Reflectance Index) coating reduces surface temperature by 15-25°C.

## Regulatory Context for Outbuildings in Portugal

**Licensing:** Under Portuguese municipal planning law (RJUE — Regime Jurídico da Urbanização
e Edificação, Lei 60/2007 and subsequent amendments), outbuilding construction below certain
thresholds is subject to simplified licensing or notification (comunicação prévia) rather than full
planning permission (licença de construção). Specifically:
- Attached outbuildings up to 50 m² floor area: comunicação prévia in most municipalities
- Garden sheds and shelters under 10 m²: typically exempt from licensing in residential zones
- Any structure connected to the main dwelling's drainage: requires licença de obras

Waterproofing renovation of an existing outbuilding roof does not require licensing — it falls
within maintenance and repair works (obras de conservação).

**RGEU slope requirements:** The RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas, DL 38 382/51)
specifies a minimum drainage slope of 1% for flat roofs of covered buildings. Outbuilding mono-
pitch roofs typically have slopes of 5-15° (approximately 9-27%), comfortably exceeding this
requirement. Where a concrete garage roof has less than 1% slope as-built, a screed correction
layer or tapered insulation board should be installed beneath the EPDM.

**Fire regulations:** For detached single-storey outbuildings used as garages (not workshop or
storage of flammable materials), the fire reaction class requirements of SCIE (DL 220/2008)
do not typically mandate specific roof membrane fire classifications. For covered car parks
(parques de estacionamento cobertos) of more than 8 spaces or with mechanical ventilation, the
relevant SCIE categories apply and EPDM's Class E fire classification should be confirmed against
the specific project's utilisation category.

| Liquid PU / polyurea | 10-15 years | Good for complex shapes | Requires recoating every 5-10 years |

## Single-Sheet Advantage — Technical Detail

EPDM's widths of up to 6.1 m and lengths up to 61 m mean that virtually any outbuilding roof in
Portugal can be covered with a single factory-produced sheet. This eliminates the need for field
seams — the highest-risk elements in any waterproofing system. When a seam is required (typically
for roofs wider than 6.1 m), EPDM seam tape provides a bonded overlap that, when correctly
applied, achieves the same mechanical strength and waterproofing performance as the membrane
field. However, every avoided seam is a risk eliminated — and for the shed and garage segment,
single-sheet coverage is achievable in almost all cases.

The contrast with traditional built-up bituminous felt is stark: a 4 m wide shed roof requires
four courses of 1 m wide felt, creating three seam lines plus two eave seams — five potential
failure interfaces on a simple roof. EPDM eliminates all of them.
