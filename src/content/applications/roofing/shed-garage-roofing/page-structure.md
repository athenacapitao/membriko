# Shed and Garage Roofing (Coberturas de Barracões e Garagens) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The shed and garage roofing page targets a different audience from the flagship flat-roofs page.
Where flat-roofs speaks to architects, specifiers and building owners managing significant
commercial or residential assets, this page must convert three distinct profiles simultaneously:

1. **The DIY-inclined homeowner** who has a leaking shed or garage and is searching for a permanent
   solution they can apply themselves this weekend.
2. **The property owner with a detached garage or outbuilding** who wants a professional solution
   but is price-conscious and needs to understand why EPDM is worth more than a felt repair.
3. **The small contractor or builder** who regularly quotes on shed and garage roof replacements
   and needs a reliable product supplier and installer for jobs too small for commercial firms to
   bother with.

The page's persuasion arc is shorter and more practical than the flat-roofs page. Outbuilding
owners make faster decisions and are less motivated by 40-page technical specifications. The
content must communicate value quickly: one sheet, cold install, 50 years, done. Membriko is the
professional backstop for when DIY is not appropriate or not desired.

The comparison section is especially important here: the direct competition is not TPO or PVC
(no outbuilding owner is choosing between thermoplastic membranes) — it is felt, corrugated
sheet and fibrocimento. These comparisons must be honest and specific, not dismissive.

The FAQ section carries extra weight because DIY installers and first-time buyers have very specific,
practical questions that drive high-intent searches ("can I put EPDM on corrugated iron", "how
thick EPDM for shed", "EPDM DIY garage Portugal").

## Section 1: Introduction — Small Buildings Matter Too

**Purpose:** Establish that outbuilding waterproofing deserves the same engineering rigour as
commercial roofing. Hook all three audience profiles.

**Content:**
- Open with the observation that a leaking shed or garage is often tolerated for years because the
  building "is just an outbuilding" — but the contents, the structure, and potentially the habitable
  space above or beside it are all at risk.
- State the market problem: the default choice for shed and garage roofs in Portugal (economy felt,
  corrugated fibre-cement) was never engineered to last more than 10-20 years, yet the structures
  they cover are expected to last 50+.
- Introduce Membriko and EPDM as the permanent solution: one installation, no torch, no seams, 50+
  years without maintenance.
- Mention availability of both professional Membriko installation and DIY-accessible product kits.
- Stat blocks: 50+ years life / from 1 day install / zero maintenance / 20-year warranty

## Section 2: Why EPDM Is Ideal for Shed and Garage Roofs

**Purpose:** Build the rational case that EPDM is the correct material for this specific
application — not a commercial product being repurposed, but the optimal solution.

**Content:**
- Cold installation compatibility with timber, metal and concrete substrates
- Single-sheet coverage up to 6.1 m wide — no field seams for most outbuilding roofs
- Lightweight (no structural dead load additions)
- DIY-accessible for competent installers on simple structures
- No torch, no odour, no fire risk near timber
- UV and thermal performance across Portugal's full climate range

**Visual:** Icon grid (6 icons with short labels)

## Section 3: Outbuilding Roof Types

**Purpose:** Help visitors identify their specific roof type and confirm EPDM is suitable.

**Content:** Three roof profile sub-sections:

1. **Flat Roof (Cobertura Plana)** — 0-5° slope, typically concrete slab or timber deck. Most
   common on attached garages. EPDM is the premier flat-roof material; full adhesive or ballasted
   system depending on substrate.

2. **Mono-Pitch (Cobertura de Uma Água)** — 5-15° slope, the standard shed profile. Single-sheet
   EPDM bonded to OSB or timber deck, with lapped edges at eaves and ridge secured with aluminium
   trim. The simplest and most common EPDM outbuilding application.

3. **Apex / Duo-Pitch (Cobertura de Duas Águas)** — Two-slope roof meeting at a ridge. EPDM can
   cover apex roofs in two sheets joined at the ridge with EPDM seam tape, or for smaller structures
   (ridge width under 3 m) sometimes in a single sheet with formed ridge detail. More complex
   installation — professional installation recommended.

## Section 4: Common Failures — Felt, Corrugated Sheet and Fibrocimento

**Purpose:** Diagnose the pain the visitor is most likely experiencing. Build empathy and urgency.

**Content:** Three failure profiles as cards or expandable panels:

1. **Economy Bituminous Felt** — How it fails (UV oxidation, nail holes, shrinkage at seams),
   timeline (5-10 years under Portuguese UV), why patching doesn't work, cumulative cost of
   repeated replacement.

2. **Corrugated Fibre-Cement and Steel** — How it fails (algae colonisation, fixing corrosion,
   joint sealant failure, brittleness over time), asbestos-cement legacy issue for structures
   built before 1993, noise and insulation problems.

3. **Existing Bituminous Membrane (Tela Asfáltica)** — Why it bubbles, cracks and delaminates
   on uninsulated concrete garage slabs; the oxidation cycle under Portugal's UV exposure; the
   problem with torch-applied repairs near timber structures.

## Section 5: The EPDM Installation Process — 6 Steps

**Purpose:** Make the process feel predictable, professional and low-risk.

**Content:** Numbered step timeline:

1. Survey and Assessment — free technical inspection, substrate condition check, slope measurement
2. Substrate Preparation — cleaning, repair, old felt removal if required (or overlay assessment)
3. Measurement and Cutting — single sheet cut to size with 150 mm upstand allowance at all edges
4. Bonding and Installation — contact adhesive to substrate and membrane, positioning, pressing,
   corner forming
5. Edge Trims and Upstands — aluminium edge trim or EPDM termination bar at all perimeter edges,
   upstands dressed and bonded at any abutments
6. Inspection and Warranty Documentation — seam and edge check, water test where possible,
   20-year warranty certificate issued

## Section 6: DIY vs Professional Membriko Installation

**Purpose:** Honest, non-patronising assessment of when DIY is viable and when Membriko is the
right choice. Captures both audience segments without alienating either.

**Content:**
- DIY suitability criteria: roof under 30 m², rectangular plan, no penetrations, accessible OSB
  or flat substrate, installer has used contact adhesive before
- Professional Membriko advantages: warranty documentation, edge and upstand detailing, leak
  testing, correct adhesive application temperature management, handling of complex substrate
  conditions
- Side-by-side table: DIY vs Membriko professional — time, cost range, warranty, complexity
  ceiling, recommended for which scenario
- Clear statement: Membriko recommends professional installation for any garage roof connected to
  or above habitable space, any roof with penetrations, and any asbestos-containing substrate

---

## Section 7: The Single-Sheet Advantage

**Purpose:** Explain why the absence of field seams is EPDM's defining technical advantage
for this market segment. Quantify the seam risk eliminated.

**Content:**
- Seams are the highest-risk element in any flat roof waterproofing system — all documented
  failure analysis studies place seam failure as the #1 cause of membrane leaks
- Traditional felt on a 4 m wide shed = 4 courses + 3 seam lines in the field + eave seams
- EPDM on the same roof = zero field seams (single 4.5 x width sheet)
- Seam count comparison table: shed sizes vs felt seam count vs EPDM seam count
- Quality of required seams: when a join is unavoidable (roof over 6.1 m wide), EPDM lap tape
  creates a fully bonded overlap stronger than the membrane field

---

## Section 8: Ventilation and Garage Environment

**Purpose:** Address the practical question of whether EPDM changes garage interior conditions
(condensation, heat). This is a frequently asked question from garage users and builders.

**Content:**
- EPDM is impermeable — it does not introduce vapour to the roof assembly
- Summer heat: black EPDM increases radiant heat gain on uninsulated roofs; solutions: 50 mm PIR
  insulation, cool-roof coating (SRI coating reduces surface temp by 15-25°C)
- Winter condensation: cause is interior vapour meeting cold slab, not the membrane; solution
  is vapour control at interior face, not modification of the EPDM system
- Working garage considerations: adequate ventilation openings at eaves and ridge independent of
  the waterproofing system

## Section 10: EPDM vs Felt, Corrugated Sheet and Fibrocimento

**Purpose:** Objective comparison table addressing the specific alternatives relevant to this
market segment (not PVC vs TPO — that is the commercial flat-roof conversation).

**Content:** Comparison table:

| Feature | EPDM | Economy Felt | Corrugated Fibre-Cement | Corrugated Steel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proven service life | 50+ years | 5-10 years | 20-30 years | 20-30 years |
| Seam count (4 m roof) | Zero | 3+ field seams | Overlapping joints | Overlapping joints |
| Cold installation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Substrate flexibility | Any | Timber only | Structural | Structural |
| DIY accessible | Yes | Yes | Specialist fixings | Specialist fixings |
| Maintenance requirement | None | Replace every 5-10 yr | Seal joints; treat algae | Paint; re-fix loose sheets |
| Asbestos risk | None | None | Pre-1993 stock risk | None |
| 30-year total cost | Lowest | Highest (3+ replacements) | Medium | Medium-high |

## Section 11: Cost Analysis — Long-Term Value

**Purpose:** Quantify the financial case for EPDM over the life of the building. Convert the
"EPDM costs more" objection with total cost of ownership data.

**Content:**
- Illustrative 30-year cost comparison per 20 m² shed roof (index figures, not absolute prices):
  EPDM vs three felt replacements vs fibrocimento with maintenance
- Note on disposal cost: old felt and fibrocimento require skip hire and waste disposal; EPDM
  needs no replacement and is recyclable at end of life
- Note on contents protection: calculate replacement cost of garage contents (tools, bikes, stored
  goods) against roof waterproofing cost — even one leak event can justify the EPDM premium
- Membriko 20-year warranty as residual value component: documented warranty increases property
  valuation and simplifies mortgage/insurance due diligence on outbuildings

---

## Section 12: Maintenance — What (Not) to Do

**Purpose:** Set expectations correctly (EPDM requires almost no maintenance) and provide the
minimal maintenance guidance that preserves the warranty.

**Content:**
- Annual visual inspection: check edge trims and any penetration boots for displacement
- Keep drains and downpipes clear of leaves (applies to guttering, not membrane itself)
- Do not use petroleum-based solvents to clean EPDM (use dilute detergent only)
- Do not allow concentrated chemical contact (paint thinners, petrol spillage on the surface)
- Moss and algae: remove mechanically with a soft brush and dilute bleach solution; do not use
  pressure washers at close range
- Do not puncture or penetrate the membrane without using EPDM repair patches and adhesive
- Membriko inspection offer: annual inspection visit available on request for installations under
  warranty; free during the first 5 years after installation

---

## Section 13: Portuguese Context — Licensing, RGEU and Asbestos

**Purpose:** Address the regulatory and compliance questions specific to Portugal that affect
the decision to install, replace or renovate an outbuilding roof.

**Content:**
- Licensing thresholds for outbuilding construction vs renovation (comunicação prévia vs obras
  de conservação)
- RGEU slope minimums and what to do if a concrete garage roof has insufficient fall
- Asbestos-cement legacy: identification, health risk, legal requirement for certified removal,
  Membriko's protocol for asbestos substrate scenarios (referral to certified removal contractor
  before any EPDM installation)
- Municipal variation: some municipalities require comunicação prévia for any roof change on
  structures in conservation areas (ARUs) — Membriko advises clients to check with the local
  câmara before proceeding on heritage-zone properties

## Section 14: FAQ

**Purpose:** Capture high-intent search queries. Answer the specific practical questions that
outbuilding owners and small contractors have before purchasing.

Eight questions:

1. **Posso instalar EPDM sobre o feltro betuminoso antigo sem o remover? / Can I install EPDM
   over old bituminous felt without removing it?**
   Generally yes, if the existing felt is flat, well-adhered and without significant blisters or
   delamination. A primer coat ensures adhesion between the old felt and new EPDM. If the felt is
   heavily buckled or detached, removal is required for a flat, bondable surface. Membriko assesses
   each substrate during the free survey visit.

2. **Qual a espessura de EPDM recomendada para uma garagem? / What EPDM thickness is recommended
   for a garage?**
   For a standard residential garage or shed without regular pedestrian traffic, 1.0 mm is the
   recommended minimum. If the roof is walked on for maintenance, specify 1.2 mm. 0.75 mm is
   suitable for small garden shelters with no foot traffic.

3. **O EPDM pode ser instalado sobre chapa ondulada de ferro? / Can EPDM be installed over
   corrugated iron sheet?**
   Yes. The standard method is to fix EPDM over the corrugation crests using mechanical fasteners
   with EPDM-backed sealing washers, or to bond a flat overlay board (OSB or cement board) to the
   crests and then adhesive-bond the EPDM to the board. Direct adhesive bonding to corrugated
   profile is not recommended without a flat intermediate layer.

4. **O meu alpendre tem uma inclinação de 10° — o EPDM prende-se sem escorregar? / My shed has
   a 10° slope — will EPDM stay in place without slipping?**
   Yes. EPDM bonded with contact adhesive to an OSB or timber substrate is fully stable at slopes
   up to 45°. At slopes between 15° and 30°, additional mechanical edge fixings at the ridge and
   side edges are specified. Above 30°, EPDM transitions into a pitched-roof underlay application
   and is secured with battens above the membrane.

5. **O EPDM aguenta o peso da neve em zonas de montanha? / Does EPDM withstand snow load in
   mountain areas?**
   EPDM is flexible to -45°C and does not crack or delaminate under freeze-thaw cycling or snow
   loading. The limiting factor is the structural capacity of the roof deck itself, not the
   membrane. In high snow-load zones (Trás-os-Montes, Serra da Estrela, Beira Interior), the
   structural frame and deck should be verified for the applicable snow load per EN 1991-1-3.

6. **Quanto tempo dura uma instalação de EPDM numa garagem de 25 m²? / How long does an EPDM
   installation take on a 25 m² garage?**
   A professional Membriko two-person team typically completes a straightforward 25 m² flat or
   mono-pitch garage roof in one working day, including substrate preparation, membrane bonding,
   edge trims and end-of-day inspection. Complex roofs with multiple penetrations or requiring
   screed correction add one to two additional days.

7. **O EPDM pode ser pintado para combinar com a estética do edifício principal? / Can EPDM
   be painted to match the aesthetics of the main building?**
   Standard EPDM is produced in black. It can be coated with a compatible water-based EPDM topcoat
   in grey, white or terracotta tones, which also functions as a cool-roof coating (SRI effect).
   Solvent-based paints and coatings must never be applied directly to EPDM — only water-based
   EPDM-specific topcoats are compatible. Membriko advises on compatible coating products as part
   of the specification process.

8. **A garagem tem uma cobertura de amianto — o que fazer? / My garage has an asbestos roof —
   what to do?**
   Asbestos-cement sheets (fibrocimento com amianto, typically white or grey corrugated sheets)
   were banned from new construction in Portugal in 1993. Existing sheets that are intact and
   unbroken present a low risk if left undisturbed, but must be removed by a certified contractor
   (empresa licenciada para remoção de amianto) before any overlay work. Membriko does not install
   directly over asbestos-containing materials. We coordinate with certified removal contractors
   and can proceed with EPDM installation once the substrate is clean and safe. Contact us for
   guidance on the removal and renovation sequence.
