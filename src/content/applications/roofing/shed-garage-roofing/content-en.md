# EPDM Waterproofing for Shed and Garage Roofs

## Small Buildings Deserve a Permanent Solution Too

There is a very human tendency to tolerate problems on structures we mentally classify as secondary. A shed with a drip in one corner. A garage whose roof is no longer fully watertight when rain arrives on the wind. A carport that weeps onto the car on a December morning. We put up with these situations for months or years because it is "only a shed" and the repair "can wait". The usual result of this tolerance is entirely predictable: contents get damaged, the timber structure begins to rot, the adjacent wall face stains, and when the decision to act finally arrives, the work is significantly more expensive than it would have been had the roof been properly addressed from the beginning.

Membriko operates every day in this market that larger contractors consider too small to take seriously. We are EPDM rubber membrane specialists, and we apply this solution across the full range from large-scale commercial roofing to garden sheds, domestic garages and open-sided carports. There is no minimum scale below which EPDM stops making technical and economic sense. There is only the decision to do it properly or to continue patching a roof that was never engineered to last.

EPDM membrane solves the shed and garage roof problem permanently in Portugal: a single cold-applied installation, no gas torch, a single sheet with no field seams, a proven service life exceeding 50 years, and a 20-year Membriko installation warranty. For simple flat or mono-pitch outbuilding roofs, it is the most economical long-term solution available in the market — irrespective of the apparent lower initial cost of the alternatives.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Material for Shed and Garage Roofs

The technical requirements of shed and garage roof waterproofing are distinct from those of large-scale commercial roofing. Membriko has refined its approach to suit the specific characteristics of this market.

### Cold Installation — No Torch Near Timber

The vast majority of Portuguese sheds and carports are built with timber roof decking — OSB board, tongue-and-groove planking, solid timber joists or exposed timber rafters. Applying waterproofing with a gas torch near timber structures is an unnecessary risk when alternatives exist. EPDM is installed entirely cold, using neoprene contact adhesive applied by brush or roller. There is no open flame, no concentrated heat, no ignition risk. For garages storing vehicles, tools or garden equipment, this characteristic has immediate practical value.

### Single-Sheet Coverage for Most Outbuilding Roofs

EPDM is manufactured in roll widths up to 6.1 metres and lengths up to 61 metres as a single factory-produced sheet. A standard 5 x 6 metre garage roof can be covered with one piece of EPDM requiring no field seams — eliminating the highest-risk elements in any waterproofing system. Membriko always sizes the membrane sheet to cover the full roof without field seams wherever the dimensions permit.

### Universal Substrate Compatibility

Portuguese shed and garage roofs are built from a wide variety of materials: OSB, solid timber, galvanised steel sheet, fibre-cement, concrete, masonry, and — in older structures — asbestos-cement. EPDM bonds to any non-porous surface with neoprene contact adhesive, and to porous substrates (timber, concrete) with primer followed by neoprene adhesive. This universality means the membrane adapts to any existing roof rather than requiring substrate selection to match a specific system.

### Negligible Added Weight

An EPDM membrane at 1.0 mm weighs approximately 1.1 to 1.3 kg per square metre. A fully bonded EPDM installation on a 25 m² garage adds less than 35 kg total to the roof structure — a structurally negligible dead load even for lightweight timber frames. Unlike ballasted systems (which add 50 to 80 kg/m² of gravel) or fibre-cement sheets (which have significant self-weight), bonded EPDM places no additional stress on the structure.

### Thermal Performance Across Portugal's Full Climate Range

An uninsulated shed roof in the Algarve can reach surface temperatures above 80°C in August. The same type of structure in Trás-os-Montes may endure temperatures down to -15°C in January. EPDM has a continuous service range of -45°C to +130°C — covering both extremes without any formulation change, without softening in heat and without cracking in cold. Economy bituminous felts soften and can shift above 60-70°C and become brittle below -5°C.

## Outbuilding Roof Types — Which Profile Is Yours?

EPDM membrane is suitable for all three roof profiles commonly found on residential outbuildings in Portugal.

### Flat Roof (Cobertura Plana)

Zero to five degrees of slope. Typically found on attached or semi-attached garages with concrete slab or hollow-pot construction. This is the most straightforward EPDM application: the membrane is bonded to the deck, edges are terminated with anodised aluminium trim, and any drainage outlets receive prefabricated EPDM drain flanges. Membriko installs the same specification on a flat garage roof as it would on a commercial flat roof — because the engineering requirements are identical.

Where a concrete garage slab has less than 1% fall (the minimum required by Portugal's RGEU, Article 90), Membriko specifies a screed correction layer or tapered insulation board beneath the EPDM, restoring adequate drainage without structural intervention.

### Mono-Pitch Roof (Cobertura de Uma Água)

Five to fifteen degrees. The standard shed profile: a single roof plane falling from high to low. Mono-pitch EPDM installation is technically straightforward and usually achievable with a single unjointed sheet. The membrane is bonded to the OSB or timber deck, the low eave edge is protected with anodised aluminium trim, and the high edge is dressed over the ridge board and bonded down the rear face. For slopes above 15°, mechanical edge fixings at the ridge and side verges supplement the adhesive bond.

### Apex Roof (Telhado de Duas Águas)

Two roof planes meeting at a central ridge. EPDM covers apex roofs in two sheets joined at the ridge with EPDM lap tape, or — for narrower structures where the ridge width is under three metres — sometimes in a single sheet with a hand-formed ridge detail. Apex roofs have a higher number of edge and verge details and Membriko recommends professional installation for this profile to ensure precise corner forming and watertight ridge treatment.

## Common Failures — Felt, Corrugated Sheet and Fibre-Cement

Understanding why the current roof is failing is the essential first step to selecting the right replacement. Membriko carries out a full diagnostic inspection on every visit, but the failure patterns on Portuguese outbuilding roofs are consistent enough to describe in detail here.

### Economy Bituminous Felt

The most widely used waterproofing material on Portuguese garden sheds and carports. Sold in 1-metre wide rolls and nailed in overlapping courses with galvanised clout nails. Typical service life in Portugal: five to ten years.

The failure mechanism follows a predictable sequence. UV radiation oxidises the bituminous binders, causing surface granule loss and progressive embrittlement. The felt dries, contracts, and the overlapping seams between courses begin to open. The nail holes — always a penetration risk from day one — become active leak paths as the felt around them contracts and cracks. The ridge and eaves — where thermal movement is greatest — fail first, every time.

Patching with cold-applied bitumen or liquid tar is understandable but counterproductive: repairs are temporary, visually poor and often make subsequent replacement more difficult by adding bonded layers that must be cut through. Once felt begins to fail systematically, complete replacement is the only effective response. With Membriko EPDM, that replacement is never needed within the lifetime of the building.

### Corrugated Fibre-Cement and Corrugated Steel

Corrugated fibre-cement and galvanised steel sheets are structurally robust but have their own degradation patterns. Asbestos-free fibre-cement (post-1993 production) has a service life of 20 to 30 years, but from year 10 onwards it begins to show algae and lichen colonisation that accelerates surface degradation and blocks gutters. Fixings corrode and lose their grip, the overlap joints between sheets lose their sealant integrity, and the system begins allowing water in at joints rather than at the surface face.

Corrugated galvanised steel has similar durability: 20 to 30 years with maintenance, considerably less in coastal locations where salt exposure accelerates zinc depletion. Noise amplification from rain on steel sheet is a comfort issue that EPDM installed on an OSB deck resolves entirely.

**A critical note on asbestos:** Corrugated fibre-cement sheets produced before 1993 contain chrysotile asbestos. In Portugal, their removal is regulated under DL 266/2007, which requires a licensed contractor for removal and transport, and disposal at a licensed hazardous waste facility. Membriko does not install over asbestos-containing substrates. Where a garage has an asbestos-cement roof, we coordinate certified removal by a licensed contractor before proceeding with EPDM installation. Contact us for guidance on the full removal and installation sequence.

### Existing Torch-Applied Bituminous Membrane

Concrete garage slabs built between 1970 and 2000 frequently carry a torch-applied bituminous membrane (tela asfáltica) as their original waterproofing. After 15 to 25 years under Portuguese UV conditions, these membranes oxidise, lose flexibility, blister from trapped water vapour below, and crack at points of thermal stress — edges, corners, wall abutments. Repair attempts with overlay torch application extend the useful life by five to ten years but never resolve the underlying problem.

Membriko installs EPDM directly over existing bituminous membranes that are well-adhered and free from significant blistering. This overlay approach avoids removal costs and disposal fees, and the EPDM bonds reliably to the bituminous surface with appropriate primer.

## The Membriko Installation Process — Six Steps

EPDM installation on a shed or garage roof follows a rigorous process. Membriko applies the same technical discipline to a 20 m² garage as to a 2,000 m² commercial roof — because the principles of effective waterproofing do not change with scale.

### Step 1 — Technical Survey and Diagnosis

Membriko carries out a free technical inspection of any shed or garage roof. Our technicians document the substrate condition photographically, measure the actual roof slope, identify all singular points (penetrations, outlets, wall abutments, gutters and edge details) and assess whether the existing system can be overlaid or requires removal. The visit results in a written diagnostic report and a detailed work proposal.

### Step 2 — Substrate Preparation

The substrate receives treatment appropriate to its condition. Timber and OSB decks are cleaned and any damaged or rotten boards are repaired or replaced. Concrete and existing bituminous surfaces have loose material removed, cracks filled with compatible sealant and a bonding primer applied. Where slope is insufficient, a screed correction layer is applied before the membrane.

### Step 3 — Measurement and Cutting

The EPDM sheet is measured and cut with 150 mm excess at each edge to allow for the minimum upstand height and perimeter trim detail. For roofs narrower than 6.1 metres, a single unjointed sheet is the standard approach. Membriko confirms the roof plan layout before cutting to eliminate waste and ensure correct positioning.

### Step 4 — Bonding and Membrane Installation

Neoprene contact adhesive is applied to both the substrate and the underside of the membrane in two coats, with flash-off time observed as specified for the prevailing temperature and humidity conditions. Membriko technicians carry digital hygrometers to confirm conditions are within the adhesive application window — below 80% relative humidity and between 5°C and 35°C ambient temperature. The membrane is positioned, pressed with a compression roller and corners are precisely formed to ensure continuity without creases or voids.

### Step 5 — Edge Trims, Upstands and Perimeter Details

All perimeter edges receive anodised aluminium trim or EPDM termination bar, mechanically fixed with stainless steel fasteners and sealed with butyl mastic. Where the membrane rises against a wall or parapet, the minimum upstand height is 150 mm, with the top edge mechanically secured. Pipe penetrations and drain outlets receive prefabricated EPDM accessories — pipe boots, compatible drain flanges — rather than exposed mastic, which degrades within three to five years.

### Step 6 — Inspection and Warranty Documentation

On completion, Membriko carries out a full visual inspection of all edges, upstands and accessories. Where conditions allow, a watertightness test is performed (controlled flooding or electronic leak detection). The client receives complete photographic documentation of the installation process, the technical specification of the installed system, and the Membriko 20-year installation warranty certificate.

## DIY or Professional Membriko Installation — Choosing the Right Approach

EPDM is the only professional waterproofing membrane system that major European manufacturers explicitly approve for competent DIY installation on small structures. This is not marketing — it reflects genuine product characteristics: no torch, no specialist equipment, a logical process, and tolerance of small first-time errors.

### When DIY Is a Viable Choice

EPDM self-installation is technically appropriate when all of the following apply:
- Simple rectangular roof of less than 30 m²
- No penetrations, drainage outlets or complex wall abutments
- Flat, dry substrate of OSB, plywood or well-adhered flat bituminous surface
- Installer has prior experience with contact adhesive application
- Roof slope below 15° (steeper pitches require mechanical edge fixings)

For these situations, Membriko supplies EPDM product kits with adhesive, primer and accessories, together with a detailed installation guide. The result of a competent DIY installation on a simple rectangular shed is equivalent to a professional installation.

### When Membriko Is the Right Choice

Professional Membriko installation is recommended whenever:
- The garage roof is integrated with or directly below habitable space — any failure has immediate consequences for the dwelling interior
- There are pipe penetrations, drainage outlets, ventilators or other fittings requiring prefabricated accessories and precise technique
- The substrate is corrugated sheet (requires specific mechanical fastening technique or intermediate deck)
- The substrate contains asbestos (certified removal is mandatory before any installation)
- The roof area exceeds 50 m² or has an irregular plan requiring field seams
- The client requires formal warranty documentation for insurance, mortgage or property registration purposes

The cost differential between a DIY approach and a professional Membriko installation for a 25 m² garage is frequently smaller than the DIY installer expects, once tool hire, material waste on first application, the cost of any correction visit, and the 20-year warranty differential are factored in.

| Criteria | DIY | Membriko Professional |
|---|---|---|
| Recommended area | Up to 30 m² | Any area |
| Plan complexity | Simple rectangle | Any geometry |
| Penetrations | None | Any penetrations |
| Time (20 m² shed) | Full working day | 3-4 hours (2 technicians) |
| Warranty | Material only | 20-year installation + material |
| Cost basis | Materials only | Materials + skilled labour |

## The Single-Sheet Advantage — Why Seams Are the Enemy

The absence of field seams is the single most important technical advantage of EPDM membrane for shed and garage roofs. It deserves careful explanation.

In every waterproofing system, seams and overlaps are the highest-risk elements: they are where two pieces of material join, where adhesion can weaken under thermal cycling, and where water finds the path of least resistance whenever there is any deficiency in execution. This reality is documented in every published failure analysis of waterproofing membranes — seam failures account for the majority of documented infiltration events, not failure of the membrane field.

A shed four metres wide, covered with economy bituminous felt in one-metre rolls, requires at least three longitudinal field seams, plus ridge and eaves seams — five to seven risk interfaces on a 20 m² roof.

The same shed covered by Membriko with EPDM has zero field seams. A single sheet measuring 4.5 metres by the required length covers the entire surface. The only seam detail is at the perimeter, where the membrane is terminated with aluminium trim — a controlled, mechanical, inspectable detail.

This difference is not marginal. For the property owner who wants to install a roof and never think about it again, eliminating field seams is the difference between a genuinely permanent solution and a solution that is probably adequate. Membriko builds its shed and garage roof installations on the permanent-solution basis.

### Seam Count Comparison

| Roof Width | Economy Felt Seams | EPDM Seams (Membriko) |
|---|---|---|
| 3 m | 2 field seams + perimeter | Zero field seams |
| 4 m | 3 field seams + perimeter | Zero field seams |
| 5 m | 4 field seams + perimeter | Zero field seams |
| 6 m | 5 field seams + perimeter | Zero field seams |
| 7 m | 6 field seams + perimeter | One field seam (6.1 m limit) |

## Ventilation and the Garage Interior

Installing EPDM on a garage roof frequently prompts practical questions about ventilation, condensation and interior temperature. Membriko addresses these regularly — here are the technically correct answers.

### Condensation on Concrete Slabs

The most common condensation problem in unheated concrete-slab garages is not caused by the EPDM membrane — it is caused by the temperature differential between the warmer garage interior and the cold concrete slab. Warm, humid interior air rises, contacts the cold slab and condenses on the garage ceiling. The solution is a vapour control layer on the interior face of the slab (polyethylene sheet or insulation panel with integral vapour barrier), not any modification to the EPDM system above. Membriko identifies and communicates this issue during the initial diagnostic inspection.

### Summer Heat in Uninsulated Garages

Black EPDM on an uninsulated roof increases solar radiation absorption and can raise the garage interior temperature by five to ten degrees compared to a white or galvanised sheet roof. For garages used as workshops or for storage of temperature-sensitive materials, Membriko specifies one of two solutions: (1) 50 mm of PIR insulation board between the deck and membrane, which significantly reduces heat transfer to the interior; or (2) a water-based EPDM topcoat in a light colour (white or grey) with a cool-roof effect (high SRI value), reducing membrane surface temperature by 15 to 25°C. The additional cost of insulation or topcoat is frequently justified by the improvement in interior working conditions.

### Garage Ventilation

EPDM is impermeable to air and water vapour — it neither contributes to nor impairs garage ventilation. Adequate ventilation for a garage space is provided by wall openings (ventilation grilles, gaps under the door) and should be sized independently of the waterproofing solution. Membriko does not design garage ventilation systems but can advise on the compatibility of the waterproofing specification with any existing ventilation arrangement.

## Technical Specifications

The specifications below apply to EPDM membrane installed by Membriko on shed and garage roofs. For specific applications (roofs above habitable space, chemical exposure environments, roofs with regular pedestrian traffic), Membriko specifies the appropriate thickness and installation system.

| Property | Value | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Available thickness | 0.75 mm / 1.0 mm / 1.2 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 7 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic — no degradation | EN 1844 |
| Water absorption | < 1% by weight | ASTM D471 |
| Maximum roll width | 6.1 m | — |
| Maximum sheet length | 61 m | — |
| Product standard | EN 13956 | — |
| Fire reaction class | Class E | EN 13501-1 |
| Available finishes | Smooth / slate-effect / granulated | — |

**Recommended thickness by application:**
- Garden shed with no foot traffic: 0.75 mm or 1.0 mm
- Domestic garage without regular pedestrian access: 1.0 mm
- Roof occasionally walked on for maintenance: 1.2 mm
- Roof directly above habitable space: 1.2 mm (Membriko recommendation)

## EPDM vs Felt, Corrugated Sheet and Fibre-Cement

The relevant comparison for shed and garage roof waterproofing is not EPDM versus TPO or PVC — those are commercial specification materials that rarely enter this market. The genuine comparison is with what the outbuilding owner actually considers.

| Feature | EPDM | Economy Felt | Corrugated Fibre-Cement | Corrugated Steel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proven service life | 50+ years | 5-10 years | 20-30 years | 20-30 years |
| Seams on a 4 m roof | Zero | 3+ field seams | Overlapping joints | Overlapping joints |
| Cold installation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Substrate flexibility | Universal | Timber only | Structural | Structural |
| DIY accessible | Yes | Yes | Specialist fixings required | Specialist fixings required |
| Maintenance over 30 years | None | 2-3 full replacements | Joint sealing + algae treatment | Painting + loose sheet refixing |
| Asbestos risk | None | None | Pre-1993 stock | None |
| 30-year total cost | Lowest | Highest | Medium | Medium-high |
| Rain noise | Low (with OSB deck) | Low | High | Very high |
| Salt corrosion resistance | Complete | Moderate | Good | Degraded in coastal zones |

Membriko makes no apology for EPDM's higher initial cost compared to economy felt. The cost differential — typically £10 to €15 per square metre — is recovered in the first felt replacement cycle that the owner never has to undertake, within a five to ten year horizon. On a 20 m² shed, the saving from avoided felt replacement over 30 years comfortably exceeds the additional initial investment of EPDM by a significant margin.

---

## Cost Analysis — The Long-Term Financial Case

The economic argument for EPDM on shed and garage roofs is, in some respects, more straightforward than for large commercial roofing — because the alternatives are weaker and the replacement cycles more frequent.

### Lifecycle Cost — 20 m² Shed Roof Over 30 Years

The figures below are illustrative index values based on typical Portuguese market ranges. Actual quotations depend on project specifics.

| Cost Component | Membriko EPDM | Economy Bituminous Felt |
|---|---|---|
| Initial installation | Index 100 | Index 45 |
| Replacement at year 7-8 | Not required | Index 45 |
| Replacement at year 14-16 | Not required | Index 45 |
| Replacement at year 21-22 | Not required | Index 45 |
| Minor maintenance and repairs | Index 5 | Index 20 |
| **Total 30-year cost** | **~Index 105** | **~Index 200** |

The case becomes even stronger when indirect costs are considered: damage to tools, bicycles, stored furniture and other garage contents from a single leak event; the cost of drying and repairing timber structure that has been absorbing moisture through a failing felt roof for two seasons; and the disruption and inconvenience of repeating the roof replacement process every seven to ten years.

### Residual Value

A garage with a documented Membriko EPDM installation and a 20-year warranty has measurable residual value in a property transaction. A surveyor or buyer who finds that the garage roof was waterproofed with EPDM five years ago with 15 years of warranty remaining does not price in reinvestment cost — in sharp contrast to a garage with ageing felt that "might last a few more years". This matters in Portugal's active property resale market, where outbuilding condition is increasingly scrutinised by buyers and mortgage valuers.

---

## Maintenance — What EPDM Needs (and What It Does Not)

Membriko-installed EPDM requires minimal maintenance. The following guidelines preserve the membrane and the warranty.

### Annual Visual Inspection

Once per year, ideally at the end of autumn before the rainy season begins, check the following:
- Perimeter trims: confirm no displacement, lifting or open joints at trim edges
- Pipe boots and drain flanges: verify they remain fully bonded and undisplaced
- Gutters and downpipes: clear of leaves and debris to ensure free drainage
- Membrane surface: verify absence of cuts, punctures or missing material

### Cleaning

EPDM membrane can be cleaned with a dilute solution of domestic detergent in water, applied with a soft-bristle brush. Do not use petroleum-based solvents — white spirit, naphtha, acetone — as these dissolve the contact adhesive and can degrade the membrane surface. Do not use a pressure washer at close range (less than 30 cm) as the jet can force water under perimeter trim edges.

### Moss and Algae

Black EPDM in humid zones may develop algae or moss colonisation after several years. Remove with a brush and dilute bleach solution (one part household bleach to ten parts water). Do not use concentrated herbicides or industrial cleaning agents without verifying compatibility with EPDM. Membriko can advise on compatible cleaning products if in doubt.

### Repairs

Small cuts or punctures in the membrane (under 50 mm) can be repaired with a self-adhesive EPDM patch and contact adhesive — a repair kit is available from Membriko. Larger damage requires a technical inspection and may involve panel replacement. During the 20-year Membriko warranty period, any installation defect is covered without additional cost to the client.

## Portuguese Regulatory Context — Licensing, RGEU and Asbestos

### Licensing for Outbuilding Work

In Portugal, the legal framework for outbuilding construction and renovation is established by the RJUE (Regime Jurídico da Urbanização e Edificação, Law 60/2007 and subsequent amendments). For property owners planning EPDM installation on a garage or shed, the relevant provisions are:

**Repair and conservation of an existing roof:** No licensing or prior notification is required. Replacing or overlaying the waterproofing on an existing roof is classified as maintenance work (obras de conservação), which the owner can carry out without municipal approval, provided the structure's volume and external appearance are not altered.

**Construction of a new outbuilding:** For new sheds or garages, the threshold between prior notification (comunicação prévia) and a full building licence (licença de construção) varies by municipality and the applicable Municipal Master Plan (PDM). As a general guide, structures under 10 m² in residential zones are typically exempt from licensing, and structures between 10 m² and 50 m² are subject to prior notification. Membriko advises clients to confirm the specific rules with their local câmara municipal before proceeding with any new construction.

**Structures in conservation areas (ARUs):** In historic city centres and designated Urban Rehabilitation Areas, any change to the exterior appearance — including roofing materials — may require prior municipal approval. Black EPDM is generally accepted on outbuildings within ARUs, but confirmation from the local authority is recommended before proceeding.

### RGEU Slope Requirements

Portugal's RGEU (Decreto-Lei 38 382/51, Article 90) establishes a minimum drainage slope of 1% for flat roofs of covered buildings. Mono-pitch shed and garage roofs typically have slopes of 5° to 15°, comfortably exceeding this minimum. Where an existing concrete garage slab has less than 1% fall as built, Membriko specifies a screed correction layer or tapered insulation board beneath the EPDM, restoring adequate drainage without any structural intervention.

### The Asbestos Question — Membriko's Protocol

Membriko maintains a clear and non-negotiable protocol for roofs involving asbestos-cement materials (sheets produced before 1993, typically white or grey corrugated panels):

1. Visual identification during the free technical survey
2. Written notification to the client of the material risk and legal obligations
3. Referral to a certified asbestos removal contractor (licensed under DL 266/2007)
4. Waiting for completion of certified removal and issue of a clean-substrate declaration
5. Proceeding with EPDM installation on the clean, safe substrate

Membriko does not install over asbestos-containing materials, does not recommend overlay of asbestos without prior removal, and does not assist clients in circumventing the legal requirements for certified removal. This protocol protects our technicians, our clients, their neighbours, and the environment. If you contact Membriko about a garage with asbestos-cement roofing, we will guide you through the entire removal-and-installation process from first inspection to final warranty documentation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I install EPDM over old bituminous felt without removing it?**

Generally yes, provided the existing felt is flat, well-adhered and free from significant blistering or detachment. A primer coat ensures adhesion between the old felt and new EPDM membrane. If the felt is heavily buckled, delaminating or detached in significant areas, removal is required to achieve a flat, bondable surface. Membriko assesses every substrate during the free survey visit and provides a written recommendation on overlay versus removal before any work begins.

**What EPDM thickness is recommended for a garage?**

For a standard domestic garage without regular pedestrian traffic on the roof, 1.0 mm is the recommended specification. If the roof is occasionally walked on for maintenance tasks such as aerial adjustment or gutter clearing, specify 1.2 mm. For small garden sheds with no foot traffic whatsoever, 0.75 mm is technically sufficient. Membriko always recommends 1.2 mm for any garage roof located directly above habitable living space.

**Can EPDM be installed over corrugated iron sheet?**

Yes. The standard method is to fix the EPDM over the corrugation crests using mechanical fasteners with EPDM-backed sealing washers, or to install a flat overlay board (OSB or cement board) secured to the corrugation crests and then adhesive-bond the EPDM to the flat board. Direct adhesive bonding to a corrugated profile without an intermediate flat layer is not recommended — the contact area in the corrugation troughs is insufficient for reliable adhesion. Membriko specifies the most appropriate method after inspecting the existing corrugated sheet profile.

**My shed has a 10-degree slope — will EPDM stay in place without slipping?**

Yes. EPDM bonded with contact adhesive to an OSB or timber substrate is fully stable at slopes up to 45°. For slopes between 15° and 30°, Membriko adds mechanical edge fixings at the ridge board and side verges to supplement the adhesive bond. Above 30°, EPDM transitions into a pitched-roof underlay application and is secured with timber battens fixed above the membrane — a distinct installation method with different technical requirements. For the typical shed profile of 5° to 15°, standard bonded installation is completely adequate and no slippage risk exists.

**Does EPDM withstand snow loading in mountain regions?**

EPDM remains flexible to -45°C and does not crack or delaminate under freeze-thaw cycling or snow loading. The structural limiting factor is always the roof deck and the frame beneath it, not the membrane. In high snow-load zones — Trás-os-Montes, Serra da Estrela, Beira Interior — the structural frame and deck must be verified for the applicable snow load per EN 1991-1-3. Membriko identifies structural concerns during the survey visit and can advise on straightforward deck reinforcement measures where needed.

**How long does a Membriko EPDM installation take on a 25 m² garage?**

A Membriko two-person team typically completes a straightforward flat or mono-pitch 25 m² garage roof in a single working day, including substrate preparation, membrane bonding, edge trims and end-of-day inspection. Roofs with multiple penetrations, or requiring a screed correction layer to improve drainage, add one to two additional days to the programme. Membriko provides a written programme with every quotation so clients can plan access and any required moves of garage contents.

**Can EPDM be painted to match the appearance of the main building?**

Standard EPDM is produced in black. It can be coated with a compatible water-based EPDM topcoat in grey, white or light terracotta tones, which simultaneously functions as a cool-roof coating — reducing membrane surface temperature by 15 to 25°C. Solvent-based paints and standard masonry or metal paints must not be applied directly to EPDM — only water-based EPDM-specific topcoat products are compatible. Membriko advises on appropriate topcoat products and can include application as part of the installation scope where requested.

**My garage has an asbestos roof — what should I do?**

Asbestos-cement sheets (typically white or grey corrugated panels, produced before 1993) are a regulated hazardous material in Portugal. Intact, undamaged sheets present a low risk if left in place and undisturbed. When removal is required — which it is whenever overlay work is planned — this must be carried out by a contractor certified under DL 266/2007, with waste disposed at a licensed hazardous waste facility. Membriko does not install EPDM over asbestos-containing materials. We coordinate with certified removal contractors and are ready to proceed with EPDM installation once the substrate is clean and the client holds the certified removal documentation. Contact us for guidance — we manage the complete process from initial assessment to final warranty, and we have established relationships with certified removal firms covering the full Portuguese territory.
