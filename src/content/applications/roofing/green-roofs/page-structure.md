# Green Roofs — Page Structure

## Unique Layout: 14 Sections

This page structure is designed specifically for green/living roofs. It emphasizes root
resistance as the key EPDM differentiator, environmental benefits as the primary market driver,
and the multi-layer system complexity that justifies professional installation.

---

### Section 1: Hero — "A Natureza Começa com a Impermeabilização"
- **Content direction**: Position EPDM as the invisible foundation that makes living roofs
  possible. The hero stat should lead with FLL certification, not just lifespan.
- **Visual**: Split image — lush green roof above / EPDM membrane cross-section below
- **Stats**: FLL Certified | 50+ Years | 60-80% Stormwater Retained | 100% Recyclable

### Section 2: The Green Roof Promise — Environmental Impact
- **Content direction**: Lead with WHY green roofs matter before discussing HOW they work.
  Urban heat island reduction, biodiversity, stormwater management, energy savings.
- **Visual**: Infographic showing 4 key environmental metrics with specific numbers
- **Data points**: 2-5°C surface temp reduction, 40-80% rainfall retention, 10-25% cooling
  energy reduction, habitat for pollinators

### Section 3: The Hidden Foundation — Why Waterproofing Makes or Breaks a Green Roof
- **Content direction**: Dramatic contrast between a thriving green roof and the catastrophic
  cost of membrane failure underneath one. Emphasize that repair = removing everything above.
- **Visual**: Diagram of the complete layer system with EPDM highlighted at the base
- **Key message**: The membrane you can't see is the most important decision you'll make

### Section 4: Root Resistance — EPDM's Natural Superpower
- **Content direction**: Deep dive into WHY EPDM resists roots without biocides. Explain FLL
  test protocol, EN 13948, cross-linked polymer structure. Compare with biocide-dependent
  alternatives (PVC, bitumen).
- **Visual**: Microscope-style comparison — EPDM molecular structure vs root tip
- **Key differentiator**: Natural resistance vs chemical treatment

### Section 5: Green Roof Types — Choosing Your System
- **Content direction**: Three-tier explanation with clear decision criteria: weight, budget,
  maintenance tolerance, visual goals. Help reader self-select the right system type.
- **Visual**: Three side-by-side cross-sections (extensive, semi-intensive, intensive)
- **Table**: Substrate depth, weight, plant types, maintenance frequency, EPDM thickness

### Section 6: The Complete Layer System
- **Content direction**: Layer-by-layer walkthrough from structural deck to vegetation. Explain
  the purpose of each layer and why skipping any one leads to system failure.
- **Visual**: Exploded axonometric diagram of all 9 layers
- **Key point**: Single-sheet EPDM = no seams = no weak points for roots

### Section 7: Stormwater Management — The Numbers
- **Content direction**: Quantified stormwater retention data for Portuguese rainfall profiles.
  Position green roofs as infrastructure, not just aesthetics.
- **Visual**: Rainfall retention chart for Lisbon and Porto annual profiles
- **Data**: 40-60% annual retention (extensive), 60-80% (intensive), peak flow 60-90% reduction

### Section 8: Membriko's 8-Step Green Roof Process
- **Content direction**: Emphasize the additional steps vs standard flat roof (structural
  assessment for load, flood testing before covering, drainage layer, substrate placement).
- **Visual**: Numbered process timeline with 8 steps
- **Steps**: Structural assessment → Slope prep → EPDM install → Flood test → Protection
  fleece → Drainage → Filter + substrate → Planting

### Section 9: Mediterranean Climate Adaptation
- **Content direction**: Address the elephant in the room — can green roofs work in hot, dry
  Portuguese summers? Yes, with correct species selection and substrate engineering.
- **Visual**: Map of Portugal with climate zones and recommended species per zone
- **Species**: Sedum album, S. hispanicum, Armeria maritima, Lavandula, Thymus

### Section 10: EPDM vs Alternatives — The Green Roof Comparison
- **Content direction**: Detailed comparison table focusing on the properties that matter most
  for green roofs: root resistance mechanism, moisture durability, seam count, environmental
  impact of biocide leaching.
- **Visual**: Comparison table with colour-coded ratings
- **Key winner categories**: Root resistance (natural), moisture resistance, sheet size, lifespan

### Section 11: Technical Specifications
- **Content direction**: Full spec table with green-roof-specific properties added
  (root resistance class, compressive strength under substrate, chemical resistance to humic acids)
- **Visual**: Clean specification table
- **Standards**: EN 13948, FLL Guidelines, EN 13956, fire classification

### Section 12: Incentives and Regulations
- **Content direction**: Municipal green roof incentives (Lisbon, Porto), BREEAM/LEED credits,
  EU Biodiversity Strategy, Construir Portugal programme benefits
- **Visual**: Map of Portuguese municipalities with green roof incentives
- **Key incentive**: Stormwater management credits, plot ratio bonuses, 6% VAT reduction

### Section 13: Maintenance Guide
- **Content direction**: Honest, practical maintenance schedule. Green roofs are NOT maintenance-
  free but Membriko's EPDM base minimises the risk of the most expensive problem (leaks).
- **Visual**: Annual maintenance calendar
- **Key message**: Low maintenance ≠ no maintenance; quality EPDM = peace of mind underneath
