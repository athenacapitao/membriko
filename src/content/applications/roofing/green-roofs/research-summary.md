# Green Roofs (Coberturas Verdes) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Green roofs — also known as living roofs, vegetated roofs or eco-roofs — are multi-layer roofing
systems where the waterproofing membrane supports a growing medium and living vegetation. The
waterproofing membrane sits at the very bottom of the assembly, beneath protection fleece, drainage
layer, filter membrane, substrate and plants. This position makes the membrane simultaneously the
most critical and the most inaccessible component: any failure requires removing every layer above
it to access the leak point.

EPDM is the technically preferred membrane for green roof waterproofing because of three properties
that directly address the unique stresses of a vegetated system: inherent root resistance, chemical
inertness in permanent moisture contact, and dimensional stability under sustained compressive load.

## Root Resistance: FLL Certification and EN 13948

The Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau (FLL) — Germany's Landscape
Research, Development and Construction Society — publishes the internationally recognised
"Guidelines for the Planning, Construction and Maintenance of Green Roofing." The FLL root
penetration test protocol is the de facto global standard for assessing whether a waterproofing
membrane can resist root intrusion.

The test procedure (also codified as EN 13948) involves:
- Placing the membrane in direct contact with aggressive root species (typically Agropyron repens
  and/or Quercus robur) in standardised growing conditions
- Maintaining the test for a minimum of 24 months (2 full growing seasons)
- Examining the membrane after the test period for any evidence of root penetration, perforation
  or physical deformation

EPDM passes FLL/EN 13948 root penetration testing without biocidal additives. This is a critical
distinction: PVC and modified bitumen membranes typically require chemical root-inhibiting agents
(biocides such as mecoprop or pendimethalin) incorporated into the membrane or applied as a
separate root barrier layer. These biocides can leach into the drainage water over time, raising
environmental concerns — particularly relevant for green roofs intended to manage stormwater
quality. EPDM achieves root resistance through its dense, vulcanised cross-linked polymer
structure: the molecular network is physically impenetrable to root tips without any chemical
treatment.

## Green Roof Types and EPDM Specification

### Extensive Green Roofs
- Substrate depth: 60-150 mm
- Saturated weight: 60-150 kg/m² (including substrate, vegetation and retained water)
- Typical vegetation: Sedum species, mosses, drought-tolerant grasses
- Maintenance: 1-2 visits per year after establishment
- EPDM thickness: 1.2 mm minimum recommended; 1.5 mm for critical installations
- Primary advantage: lightweight — suitable for retrofit on existing structures with limited
  load capacity

### Semi-Intensive Green Roofs
- Substrate depth: 150-300 mm
- Saturated weight: 150-300 kg/m²
- Vegetation: perennial grasses, herbs, small shrubs
- Maintenance: 3-6 visits per year
- EPDM thickness: 1.5 mm minimum
- Requires irrigation in Mediterranean climates during dry season

### Intensive Green Roofs (Rooftop Gardens)
- Substrate depth: 300 mm to 1,000+ mm
- Saturated weight: 300-1,200 kg/m²
- Vegetation: shrubs, trees, full garden planting
- Maintenance: regular garden maintenance schedule
- EPDM thickness: 1.5-2.0 mm; consideration for protection board over EPDM
- Structural loading: requires purpose-designed structural slab (not suitable for retrofit
  without engineering assessment)

## Layer System Above EPDM

The standard green roof assembly from bottom to top:
1. **Structural deck** (reinforced concrete slab or steel deck with concrete topping)
2. **Vapour control layer** (if warm-roof configuration)
3. **Thermal insulation** (XPS or PIR, designed for compressive strength under green roof loads)
4. **EPDM waterproofing membrane** (root-resistant, fully adhered or mechanically fastened)
5. **Protection fleece** (non-woven geotextile, typically 300-500 g/m²)
6. **Drainage layer** (expanded clay aggregate 30-60 mm, or moulded plastic drainage boards)
7. **Filter membrane** (non-woven geotextile to prevent substrate particles migrating into drainage)
8. **Growing substrate** (engineered mineral-based medium — NOT topsoil)
9. **Vegetation** (pre-grown mats, plugs or seeded)

The single-sheet capability of EPDM is a major advantage in green roof applications. Sheets up to
15.25 m wide by 61 m long (Carlisle/Elevate production) can cover large roof areas without field
seams. Every seam in a green roof membrane represents a potential root penetration point and a
potential leak point that would be extremely costly to access for repair. Minimising seams — or
eliminating them entirely — is a fundamental design principle for green roof waterproofing.

## Stormwater Management

Green roofs provide significant stormwater management benefits, which are increasingly mandated
or incentivised by European municipalities:

- **Annual retention**: Extensive green roofs typically retain 40-60% of annual rainfall; intensive
  systems retain 60-80%
- **Peak flow attenuation**: For moderate rainfall events (< 20 mm), green roofs can attenuate
  peak runoff by 60-90%
- **Delay**: Runoff peak is typically delayed by 30-90 minutes compared to conventional roof
- **Water quality**: Green roof runoff has reduced concentrations of suspended solids and some
  pollutants compared to conventional roof runoff

For Lisbon (average annual rainfall ~725 mm, concentrated October-March), extensive green roofs
can retain approximately 300-400 litres per m² per year. For Porto (average annual rainfall
~1,200 mm), retention volumes are higher in absolute terms but lower as a percentage of total
rainfall.

## Portuguese Context

### Climate Adaptation
Portugal's Mediterranean climate presents specific challenges for green roofs:
- **Summer drought**: June-September receives less than 5% of annual rainfall in the Algarve.
  Extensive green roofs must use drought-adapted species (Sedum album, S. hispanicum, S. sediforme,
  Delosperma cooperi). Irrigation may be required even for extensive systems during the first
  2-3 establishment years and during extreme drought periods.
- **Summer heat**: Substrate surface temperatures can exceed 50-60°C. The EPDM membrane beneath
  is protected by the substrate mass but must withstand sustained temperatures of 40-50°C.
- **Winter deluge**: Intense rainfall events (>50 mm/day, occasionally >100 mm/day) require
  adequate drainage layer capacity and overflow provisions.

### Native and Adapted Species
Portuguese green roof research (ISA/Universidade de Lisboa, ISEP/Porto) has identified several
native Mediterranean species suitable for extensive green roofs:
- Sedum album, S. hispanicum, S. sediforme (Sedum family — primary extensive species)
- Armeria maritima (sea thrift — coastal conditions)
- Lavandula stoechas (French lavender — semi-intensive)
- Thymus vulgaris (thyme — drought-tolerant aromatic)
- Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary — semi-intensive, deep-rooted)

### Regulations and Incentives
- Lisbon's PDM (Plano Director Municipal) encourages green roofs in new construction through
  plot ratio incentives and stormwater management credits
- Porto has implemented pilot green roof programmes on municipal buildings
- BREEAM Portugal awards credits for green roofs under the Land Use & Ecology and Water categories
- The EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 targets urban greening measures including green roofs
- "Construir Portugal" programme's 6% reduced VAT applies to green roof installations on
  qualifying residential buildings

## Research Gaps

- Limited peer-reviewed data on EPDM green roof performance specifically in Mediterranean
  climates (most published studies are from Northern/Central Europe)
- No standardised Portuguese guidance document for green roof waterproofing specification
  (practitioners rely on FLL German guidelines and manufacturer specifications)
- Long-term (20+ year) monitoring data for green roofs in Portugal does not yet exist, as the
  market is relatively young (most installations post-2015)
