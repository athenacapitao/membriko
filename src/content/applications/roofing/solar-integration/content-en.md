# Solar Panel Integration on EPDM Roofs — Complete Membriko Guide

## 1. The Roof Decision That Determines Whether Your Solar Investment Succeeds

Portugal is one of the most compelling solar markets in Europe, and the numbers make the case without ambiguity. The Pombal and Central Portugal region receives 1,700 to 1,800 kWh per square metre per year of global horizontal irradiance. The Alentejo and Algarve push even higher — 1,900 to 2,100 kWh/m²/year. To put that in context: Germany built the world's largest cumulative solar capacity during the 2010s on approximately 1,000 to 1,100 kWh/m²/year. Portuguese installations generate 60 to 90% more electricity per panel than their German equivalents.

The commercial logic is compelling. Energy tariffs have risen substantially across Portugal. Panel costs have fallen roughly 70% since 2010. Portugal's DL 162/2019 framework makes UPAC self-consumption registration straightforward and allows export compensation at 90% of the monthly OMIE market price. Registrations have grown from approximately 7,000 in 2019 to over 100,000 by 2024. The question for most building owners is no longer whether to install solar — it is when, and on what.

There is one decision that most building owners, property managers and solar installers consistently underestimate in rooftop solar projects: the choice of waterproofing membrane beneath the panels. Membriko installs EPDM membrane on roofs receiving photovoltaic systems across Portugal, operating from our base in Pombal. The reason comes down to a single critical fact: once solar panels are installed on a flat roof, the waterproofing membrane beneath them is effectively inaccessible for visual inspection, maintenance or repair without removing the entire mounting system.

If that membrane fails — whether at year 12 or year 18 — the consequences are not a simple roofing repair. They are a partial or complete demounting of the solar array, coordination between roofing contractors and electrical engineers, weeks of lost energy generation, and a reinstatement cost that typically runs to 30–40% of the original solar installation cost. Then the whole exercise must be done again for the new membrane's eventual end of life.

Membriko specifies EPDM membrane because EPDM's proven service life exceeds 50 years. That is not a marketing claim — it is the conclusion of two independent field studies (the ERA 30-year study and the SKZ German durability study) using physical specimens tested against current standards. A membrane with a 50-year service life installed beneath panels with a 25–30 year design life eliminates the membrane replacement problem for the full operational period of the current panel generation. That is the financial case in one sentence.

## 2. Why EPDM Is the Optimal Solar Base Membrane

Specifying a waterproofing membrane for a solar roof requires different criteria than specifying for a conventional flat roof. The membrane must survive without any planned maintenance intervention for 25 to 30 years. It must be chemically compatible with mounting hardware materials in permanent contact. It must resist sustained compressive loading at mount contact points without creeping. And it must be installed and repaired without flame or hot-air welding — because the solar electrical infrastructure either already exists on the roof or will be in close proximity during works.

EPDM is the only single-ply membrane that satisfies all four criteria simultaneously.

### Service Life That Outlasts the Panels

The ERA (EPDM Roofing Association) commissioned an independent field assessment of five commercial EPDM roofs aged 28 to 32 years at sampling. All five exceeded ASTM D4637 aged-membrane performance minimums for tensile strength and elongation at break. Elongation values of 180–240% were recorded — well above the 100% minimum for aged EPDM — with no delamination, oxidative cracking or plasticiser migration. The German SKZ institute tested 39 European EPDM samples and projected a median service life exceeding 50 years under Central European exposure conditions, noting that post-1990 formulations (which all current production uses) show markedly slower ageing curves.

Central Europe receives 1,000–1,100 kWh/m²/year of solar irradiance. Portugal receives substantially more. The conservative reading is that southern climate performance should be verified by dedicated Mediterranean field studies; the optimistic reading is that high-irradiance US climate data (Texas, Arizona) shows EPDM remains robust even under significantly higher UV loads. Membriko's technical position is that 50-year service life is defensible for Portugal.

No competing membrane system — TPO (15–25 years), PVC (20–30 years) or SBS modified bitumen (12–20 years) — can make an equivalent claim. For a solar installation with a 25–30 year design life, only EPDM provides confident coverage for the full panel operational period.

### Total Chemical Compatibility with Mounting Hardware

Ballasted solar mounting systems — including the Van der Valk ValkBox 3, ValkAce and the Schletter FlatFix Fusion — contact the waterproofing membrane via isolation pads of EPDM or neoprene rubber. These pads sit on the membrane for the entire life of the solar installation. EPDM is chemically inert to neoprene, to aluminium extrusions, to stainless steel fasteners and to galvanised steel components — all standard mounting system materials. There is no galvanic degradation at contact points, no plasticiser transfer, no chemical reaction over decades of contact.

PVC membranes are chemically incompatible with neoprene isolation pads. PVC plasticisers migrate into neoprene over time, creating adhesive bonding between the pad and membrane that makes mount repositioning difficult or impossible. It also progressively hardens the PVC surface at contact points. EPDM has no plasticisers to migrate; its chemical stability at the interface is permanent.

### Dimensional Stability Under Sustained Load

Each foot of a ballasted solar mount imposes a concentrated compressive load on the membrane beneath it — typically 0.5 to 1.2 kN distributed over the contact pad area. Over 25 to 30 years of continuous loading, the membrane must not creep or permanently deform at these points. Permanent deformation creates drainage basins around each mount foot, where water accumulates and accelerates membrane deterioration.

EPDM, as a fully vulcanised elastomer with permanent elastic memory, resists creep at ambient service temperatures. When the load is removed — for example, during a mount system upgrade — the membrane recovers its original profile. SBS modified bitumen is the worst performer in this respect: bitumen softens at temperatures above 50–60°C, which are routinely achieved on Portuguese rooftop surfaces in summer, even in partially shaded zones beneath panels. Bitumen under solar mounts in Portugal will creep measurably within the first decade of service.

### Cold Installation — No Flame Near Electrical Infrastructure

EPDM membrane is installed with cold-process contact adhesive or with factory-applied self-adhered butyl backing. No gas torch, no hot-air welding gun, no heat source of any kind. This distinction becomes operationally significant on solar roofs where cable conduits, DC junction boxes and inverter cabling may already be present during re-roofing works on existing buildings, or where the solar electrical installation begins while roofing works are still in progress on a new build.

Modified bitumen requires gas torch application. TPO and PVC require hot-air welding at seams. All three systems create potential ignition risk adjacent to electrical infrastructure. EPDM eliminates this risk by process design.

### Repair Without Panel Removal

If a post-installation EPDM seam defect or minor membrane damage is identified — perhaps a seam that did not fully bond, or an isolated mechanical damage point — the repair can be made using self-adhered EPDM repair tape applied cold to the cleaned surface. No heat is required. This repair can be executed within a maintenance access corridor between panel rows, in most cases without moving any part of the mounting system.

TPO and PVC seam repairs require hot-air welding — impossible safely in proximity to live electrical equipment. Bitumen repairs require torch application. EPDM's cold-repair capability is the difference between a one-hour maintenance visit and a three-week panel demounting operation.

## 3. Compatible Mounting Systems — Ballasted, Penetrating and Hybrid

Membriko does not simply waterproof roofs and then hand over to the solar installer. We understand the mounting hardware in detail and specify the membrane interface for each system type. This integrated knowledge is what distinguishes Membriko from roofing contractors who know EPDM but not solar, and from solar installers who know panels but not waterproofing.

### Ballasted Systems (Non-Penetrating)

Ballasted mounting systems are the predominant solution for flat EPDM roofs in Portugal and across Southern Europe. The mounting structure — aerodynamic aluminium trays — is placed on the membrane and held by its own weight plus concrete ballast blocks, calculated to resist wind uplift forces per EN 1991-1-4 (Eurocode 1, wind actions). No penetrations through the membrane are required.

The **ValkBox 3** from Van der Valk Solar Systems orients panels in landscape format at 10° or 15° inclination. Pre-engineered aerodynamic geometry reduces wind loads and consequently reduces the ballast mass required. The **ValkAce** offers an even lower wind-resistance profile, cutting ballast requirements by 20–30% compared to the ValkBox whilst maintaining structural performance — particularly relevant for roofs with limited structural reserve. The **Schletter FlatFix Fusion** uses an east-west orientation that maximises panel density per unit of roof area and is largely self-ballasting through its aerodynamic form, further reducing ballast weight.

All these systems include factory-attached EPDM or neoprene isolation pads at every contact point. Membriko specifies pad dimensions and materials in the project specification and verifies correct placement during the solar coordination inspection.

Total added load to the roof structure from a standard ballasted system is typically 15–25 kg/m² of roof area — substantially less than conventional EPDM gravel ballast at 50–80 kg/m². Structural verification of the existing slab or deck remains mandatory. Membriko coordinates with a structural engineer as part of every solar integration project specification.

### Penetrating Systems (Structural Attachment)

Where wind uplift forces exceed ballasted system capacity — typical on tall buildings, coastal locations with high wind exposure, or roofs with low parapets that provide minimal shelter — mounts are bolted mechanically through the membrane and insulation to the structural deck. Each anchor is a penetration through the EPDM that requires full waterproofing treatment.

Membriko treats every solar mount penetration as a critical singular point:
- Controlled drilling through membrane, insulation and deck at pre-specified locations
- Stainless steel anchor plate with flanged base, sized to allow full EPDM membrane overlap
- EPDM membrane wrapped and adhered over the flange using butyl tape and EPDM-compatible sealant
- Pre-fabricated EPDM boot applied over the bolt or anchor profile emerging above membrane level
- Photographic record of each completed penetration detail before electrical work proceeds

No anchor shank or bolt head remains exposed above the membrane surface without complete sealing. Electronic leak detection is executed after all penetrations are completed and before any mounting component is placed.

### Hybrid Systems (Perimeter-Fixed, Interior Ballasted)

Perimeter panel rows receive mechanical fixings to the roof structure to resist the elevated wind uplift forces at exposed roof edges; interior rows are held by ballast alone. This approach reduces total ballast mass while managing the structural loading pattern at the roof perimeter, where wind forces are most severe.

Membriko executes the waterproofing design for hybrid systems in coordination with the solar installer's wind load engineer, who provides the calculation output per EN 1991-1-4 for the specific roof geometry, building height and wind zone. Portugal's national annex to Eurocode 1 classifies Pombal and most of Central Portugal in Wind Zone A; coastal locations are classified Zone B with higher characteristic wind velocities.

## 4. Guaranteed Waterproofing Beneath the Panels — The Membriko Commitment

A solar roof is, from a waterproofing maintenance perspective, a roof that will never again be fully visually accessible once the panels are installed. This reality does not make quality control impossible — it makes pre-installation quality control the only quality control that matters.

Membriko responds to this with four non-negotiable operational commitments on every solar integration project.

**100% Watertightness Testing Before Solar Installation**

No mounting component is placed on a membrane that has not been tested for watertightness. Membriko executes electric field vector mapping (electronic leak detection) or flood testing across 100% of the roof surface before issuing clearance for solar installation. The test method, date, equipment serial number and result are documented and archived in the project warranty dossier. A membrane that tests positive for leaks is repaired and re-tested before clearance is issued — there is no circumstance in which a solar installation proceeds over an untested or defective membrane.

**All Singular Points in Pre-Fabricated EPDM**

Every drain, upstand flashing, cable penetration and perimeter detail is executed using factory pre-fabricated EPDM accessories — not mastic, not sealant-only systems, not non-EPDM materials. The service life of a polyurethane sealant exposed to exterior conditions is 8–12 years; the service life of a factory pre-fabricated EPDM detail is the same as the membrane itself — 50 years or more. In a solar project with a 25–30 year operational horizon, specifying the correct singular point details is not a quality preference — it is the difference between zero emergency interventions and multiple ones.

**Photographic Record of the Bare Membrane**

After the membrane installation and leak test are complete, and before any solar mounting component arrives on the roof, Membriko executes a systematic photographic survey of the complete membrane surface. Each photograph is referenced to the roof plan, date-stamped and archived in the project file. This record serves as the baseline for any future investigation: if water infiltration is detected in the building years after solar installation, it is possible to demonstrate objectively the membrane's condition at the point when the solar system was installed.

**Guaranteed Drainage Corridors**

Membriko coordinates panel row positioning with the solar installer to ensure that no row configuration creates drainage retention zones on the membrane surface. Panel rows collect and concentrate rainwater, directing it into inter-row corridors where it must drain freely to roof outlets. Membriko's minimum recommended fall for solar roofs is 1.5% — above the statutory minimum of 1% under RGEU — to compensate for the drainage disruption caused by panel rows. Where existing roofs have insufficient fall, Membriko installs fall-correction screeds before the EPDM membrane.

## 5. Portugal's Solar Market — Context, Regulation and Opportunity

### Solar Irradiance and Generation Potential

Portugal's irradiance advantage over Northern and Central Europe is not marginal — it is structural. A 100 kWp rooftop installation on a flat-roof warehouse in the Pombal area will generate approximately 60–70% more electricity annually than the same installation in Munich or Utrecht. Against the backdrop of rising electricity tariffs in Portugal and falling panel costs globally, this irradiance premium translates directly into shorter payback periods and higher returns over the panel lifetime.

Membriko has tracked the growth of UPAC registrations across our project portfolio: in 2019, solar integration was a niche consideration in roof specification. By 2024, a substantial proportion of Membriko's commercial flat-roof projects include solar integration as a primary design driver from the outset. Industrial warehouses, logistics centres, agricultural buildings, commercial premises and residential flat-roof buildings across Portugal are all active in this market.

### DL 162/2019 — The Self-Consumption Framework

Portugal's principal legislation for renewable energy self-consumption — Decree-Law 162/2019, enacted 15 October 2019 — established the regulatory framework that made rooftop solar commercially straightforward. Its key provisions:

**UPAC (Unidade de Produção para Autoconsumo)** installations are designed for on-site self-consumption, with the ability to export surplus generation to the public grid (RESP) and receive compensation. Installations up to 1 kWp are entirely exempt from registration. Installations between 1 and 30 kWp require simple registration via the SERUP online portal (Sistema Electrónico de Registo de Unidades de Produção), typically completed in 5–10 working days. Installations between 30 and 1,000 kWp require full licensing from DGEG, with potential environmental screening for larger or environmentally sensitive sites.

Compensation for surplus energy exported to the RESP grid is paid at 90% of the monthly average OMIE spot market price — not a fixed feed-in tariff, but tracking wholesale electricity market prices. In periods of elevated electricity prices, this represents meaningful additional revenue for commercial self-consumption installations.

Any installation capable of exporting to the grid requires a connection agreement with the distribution network operator (E-REDES covers most of mainland Portugal). A bidirectional meter — measuring imported and exported energy separately — is mandatory and is typically installed as part of the connection agreement.

### Planning and Building Regulations

For most existing residential and commercial buildings, rooftop solar panel installation falls within the category of works exempt from full building permit under the RJUE (DL 555/99 and subsequent amendments), provided the installation does not materially alter the building's exterior appearance. A prior communication (comunicação prévia) to the Câmara Municipal is typically required for commercial and industrial buildings. Buildings located within ARU (Urban Rehabilitation Areas) or protected heritage zones require prior consultation with the local authority and may require DRCC (Regional Culture and Conservation Directorate) approval. Flat-roof buildings in condominium ownership require assembly approval before any installation proceeds.

Membriko does not manage the solar licensing process — this is the solar installer's and client's responsibility — but our familiarity with this regulatory context ensures that our waterproofing specification does not create obstacles to the licensing or grid connection procedures.

## 6. The Membriko Installation Process — Six Stages for a Perfect Solar Roof

### Stage 1: Technical Roof Assessment

Membriko begins every solar integration project with a detailed technical site visit. The visit scope extends beyond measurement: we assess the structural capacity of the roof deck, verify existing fall and drainage configuration, identify all current penetrations and rooftop equipment, photograph any existing membrane condition in detail, and assess access constraints for installation works.

Where an existing membrane is present, Membriko evaluates its condition through visual inspection and, where its age or condition warrants it, physical sampling for assessment against current material standards. This evaluation determines whether the existing membrane can be retained, repaired or must be replaced before solar installation proceeds. Getting this determination right at the start of the project is the single most important service Membriko provides to clients considering solar integration on an existing building.

### Stage 2: Solar Waterproofing Project Design

Membriko produces a written waterproofing specification tailored to the solar integration requirements. This document includes: EPDM membrane system specification (thickness, installation method, singular point details), a panel layout coordinated with the solar installer (row spacing, access corridors, cable routing, penetration locations), a fire setback plan per DL 220/2008 and SCIE requirements, and a drainage design verified against the panel layout.

We produce this specification in direct coordination with the solar installer, the project architect on new-build works, and the structural engineer. A successful solar roof is the result of an integrated team — not specialists working in isolation.

### Stage 3: Substrate Preparation

Substrate preparation is the work that no one will ever see, but that determines everything visible thereafter. Membriko repairs all substrate deficiencies: concrete crack sealing, surface irregularity correction, removal of incompatible or degraded existing membrane, application of fall-correction screeds where the existing slope is insufficient for solar use, and primer application. On new-build projects, Membriko verifies that the concrete slab has achieved the correct flatness and fall before any waterproofing work begins. Any deviation from the design specification is communicated in writing to the client before proceeding.

### Stage 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Membrane installation follows the project specification exactly: fully adhered with contact adhesive, mechanically fastened, or a combination as the design requires. All singular points — drains, upstands, existing penetrations and the planned cable exit points for the solar installation — are completed with factory pre-fabricated EPDM accessories before any mounting system is placed. Cable conduit penetrations through the membrane are fitted with correctly sized EPDM boots at this stage, sealed completely, and verified individually before the solar installer uses them.

### Stage 5: Watertightness Testing and Documentation

This is the operational point of no return. Before any solar component arrives on the roof, Membriko executes 100% watertightness testing: electric field vector mapping where roof access and conditions permit, flood testing where applicable. The test result is documented with date, time, operator, equipment and result. Immediately after the test — before any loading, heavy foot traffic or equipment movement — the systematic photographic record of the complete membrane surface is executed and archived. Test first, photograph second: this sequence is invariable.

### Stage 6: Solar Installer Coordination

Membriko issues a written clearance document for commencement of mounting system installation, specifying the isolation pad requirements and the notification protocol for any deviation from the agreed panel layout. On the first day of mounting installation, a Membriko technician is present on the roof to verify correct pad placement and identify any unexpected site conditions. After solar installation is complete, Membriko carries out a final inspection of all accessible membrane areas — perimeter flashings, drains and inter-row drainage corridors — before issuing the project handover documentation.

---

## 7. New Build vs Solar Retrofit — Two Different Approaches

### New Build with Solar Integrated from Design Stage

The most successful solar roof begins before the foundation concrete is poured. When Membriko is engaged at design stage for a new-build project incorporating solar, the waterproofing membrane and the photovoltaic system are designed as a single integrated system. The structural slab is sized for the combined loading of membrane, insulation, ballast and panels. The drainage fall is designed to account for the flow disruption caused by panel rows. Cable conduits are incorporated within the slab or insulation layer during construction, emerging at the exact locations the solar installer will require.

The result is a roof with no unplanned penetrations, no emergency repairs before panels are installed, and complete documentation from day one of service. Membriko is experienced in this design-stage engagement role and works directly with project architects and structural engineers on new-build specifications.

### Solar Retrofit on an Existing Roof

The majority of Membriko's solar integration enquiries concern existing buildings adding solar for the first time. The starting point is always a membrane condition survey, and the outcome of that survey determines the project path.

**Membrane in acceptable service condition**: The existing EPDM has sufficient residual life to last the 25–30 year solar operational period. Membriko documents the current state comprehensively, repairs any identified minor deficiencies, tests for watertightness, photographs the bare membrane, and issues written clearance for solar installation. The Membriko warranty covers all repair work executed.

**Membrane with repairable deficiencies**: Specific zones of degradation or failed singular points can be repaired economically, and the repaired membrane has sufficient residual life for solar. Membriko executes targeted repairs, re-tests the full roof area, and issues clearance. Annual inspection of the repaired zones is a condition of the clearance.

**Membrane requiring full replacement**: The existing membrane — whether bitumen, PVC or a failed EPDM installation — is degraded beyond economic repair, or its remaining service life is insufficient for the solar project horizon. Membriko recommends full replacement before any solar installation. This is the advice that protects the client's solar investment: a new EPDM membrane with a 20-year Membriko installation warranty, installed by a specialist, before a single panel is placed.

The temptation to install solar panels over a degraded membrane — because "the roof can wait" — is the single most expensive mistake Membriko encounters in solar integration projects. Waiting means paying for membrane replacement plus the full cost of solar array demounting and reinstatement.

---

## 8. Fire Safety Compliance — DL 220/2008 and SCIE Requirements

Fire safety on roofs with solar installations is an area where the regulatory requirements are frequently misunderstood by building owners and, often, by solar installers. Membriko integrates the fire safety framework of DL 220/2008 (SCIE — Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios) and Portaria 1532/2008 into every solar integration project specification.

### Membrane Reaction to Fire Classification

EPDM membrane is classified as Class E under EN 13501-1 (reaction to fire — construction products). This is the standard classification for monolithic synthetic rubber membranes. For buildings where the roof construction is required to achieve the BROOF(t4) external fire performance class — applicable to specific building use categories and risk classifications under the SCIE regulation — Membriko specifies a mineral protection layer (minimum 25 mm washed gravel ballast, or an equivalent mineral board) over the EPDM membrane. Solar panels are classified as construction products in the Portuguese market and require fire performance documentation for inclusion in the building's fire safety dossier where required by the applicable use category.

### Fire Setback Distances and Access Corridors

ANPC (Autoridade Nacional de Protecção Civil) guidance and SCIE regulations establish firefighting access requirements for commercial and industrial roofs. In practice, photovoltaic installations on commercial buildings must incorporate:

- A minimum 1.0 m clear setback from all roof edges, parapet upstands and any raised structures
- Unobstructed access corridors of 0.9 to 1.2 m width between panel rows (specific dimension varies by building use category and ANPC guidance in force at the time of installation)
- Unobstructed access to all rooftop mechanical equipment — HVAC units, smoke vents, hatches, lift overruns

These setback requirements directly determine the maximum achievable solar capacity per unit of roof area. Membriko produces the fire setback plan as a mandatory component of the solar integration project specification, coordinating with the solar installer's panel layout design to maximise capacity within the compliant area. Where required by the building's use category, this plan is submitted to the client's fire safety consultant or to ANPC for review.

### Electrical Compliance

The solar electrical installation must comply with RTIEBT (Portuguese Low Voltage Electrical Installations Technical Regulations), IEC 62548 (PV array design safety) and IEC 61215 or IEC 61646 (module qualification). All modules must carry CE marking. Membriko coordinates cable routing and membrane penetration locations with the solar installer, ensuring that the waterproofing specification does not create conflicts with the electrical installation design or the RTIEBT verification dossier.

---

## 9. Maintenance of the Waterproofing Beneath Solar Panels

The partial inaccessibility of the membrane during the panel operational life does not mean the solar roof cannot be maintained — it means maintenance must be structured differently from a conventional flat roof. Membriko delivers a written Maintenance Plan specific to each solar integration project as part of the handover documentation.

### Annual Inspection — What Can Be Checked Without Moving Panels

The Membriko annual inspection for solar roofs covers all accessible areas of the roof without panel removal:

**Perimeter flashings and upstand connections**: These are always accessible from the roof surface or from ladder access to the roof edge. Membriko inspects adhesion at upstand level, integrity of metal capping profiles and absence of membrane cracking or de-bonding at the perimeter.

**Drains and drainage corridors**: All roof drains are inspected visually and function-tested with water. Inter-row drainage corridors are checked for obstruction by plant debris, bird material or mineral deposits. Any obstruction that could impede drainage to the roof outlets is cleared during the inspection.

**Cable penetration seals**: Each point where electrical cables exit through the EPDM membrane is inspected visually. Membriko verifies the integrity of EPDM boots and the absence of separation between boot and surrounding membrane.

**Biological growth in shaded zones**: The shaded, humid environment beneath solar panels is conducive to moss, lichen and algae growth on the EPDM surface in Atlantic-climate regions of Portugal — Porto, Aveiro, Braga, Viana do Castelo. EPDM is chemically inert to humic acids and biogenic compounds and is not damaged by biological growth, but growth can obstruct drainage corridors. Membriko clears significant biological accumulation from drainage paths during the annual inspection.

### When Panel Removal Is Necessary

Panel removal for membrane inspection or repair is only required when active water infiltration is detected in the building and its source cannot be determined from accessible areas. Before reaching this point, Membriko can apply capacitance-based electronic scanning in accessible inter-row corridors, which can in many cases detect anomalies in the membrane beneath panel arrays without any panel movement.

If panel removal is ultimately required, Membriko coordinates with the solar installer for electrical isolation, safe temporary removal of panels in the affected zone, membrane inspection and repair, and panel reinstatement. The electrical isolation sequence must follow RTIEBT and the inverter manufacturer's shutdown procedure; Membriko confirms this coordination in writing before any work begins.

## 11. EPDM vs Alternative Membranes for Solar Roofs

Membriko presents this comparison honestly. EPDM is not the cheapest option at installation and its standard black surface does not provide the diffuse light reflection of a white TPO membrane. But in the specific context of a solar roof evaluated over 30 years, EPDM's advantages are decisive.

| Criterion | EPDM | TPO | PVC | SBS Bitumen |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proven service life | 50+ years | 15-25 years | 20-30 years | 12-20 years |
| Outlasts 25-30 year solar panel life | Yes — comfortably | No | Marginally | No |
| Cold installation — no heat source | Yes | No — hot-air weld | No — hot-air weld | No — gas torch |
| Neoprene pad compatibility | Full | Verify product | Incompatible | N/A |
| Repair without panel removal | Yes — cold adhesive tape | No — heat weld | No — heat weld | No — torch |
| Creep under mount load in summer | None | Low | Moderate | Significant |
| 30-year TCO with solar | Lowest | Medium + replacement | Medium + replacement | Highest + replacement |

**A note on TPO**: TPO's white surface reflects diffuse radiation back towards panel undersides, producing a measurable energy yield gain of approximately 1–3%. This advantage is genuine and Membriko acknowledges it. However, TPO's maximum service life of 15–25 years makes membrane replacement during the solar panel operational period statistically probable on a 25–30 year solar project. A 3-week solar demounting and reinstatement event eliminates years of accumulated 2% yield advantage in a single episode, and the event may occur twice in the panel's operational life.

**A note on modified bitumen**: Bitumen membranes are frequently specified on commercial flat roofs for their lower initial cost. For solar integration, the problem is specific: bitumen softens at surface temperatures above 50–60°C. These temperatures are routinely achieved on Portuguese rooftop surfaces in summer — even in zones partially shaded by panel undersides, where reduced UV irradiance is partially offset by elevated ambient temperatures. Bitumen creep under solar mount contact points in Portugal is not a theoretical risk; it is an observed failure mode that creates drainage basins and accelerates localised membrane deterioration.

## 12. Solar Regulations in Portugal — What You Need to Know

### DL 162/2019 — Self-Consumption Framework in Detail

Portugal's Decree-Law 162/2019, which transposed the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED II), created the regulatory infrastructure for self-consumption that has driven exponential growth in rooftop solar. The framework is deliberately tiered to make small and medium installations accessible:

**UPAC up to 1 kWp**: Completely exempt from registration, licensing or notification. Suitable for very small residential applications — a single-panel hot water pre-heating system, for example.

**UPAC 1–30 kWp**: Simplified registration via the SERUP online portal (Sistema Electrónico de Registo de Unidades de Produção). For straightforward residential and small commercial installations, the digital process typically takes 5–10 working days from submission to certificate. This category covers the majority of residential and small commercial installations.

**UPAC 30–1,000 kWp**: Full licensing from DGEG (Direção-Geral de Energia e Geologia). The process includes technical documentation review and, for installations above certain thresholds or in environmentally sensitive locations, a simplified environmental impact screening. Timescales vary significantly with project complexity and municipal context.

**Export compensation**: Surplus generation exported to the RESP grid is compensated at 90% of the monthly average OMIE spot market price by the last-resort supplier. This is market-referenced, not a fixed tariff — in periods of high electricity prices, it represents meaningful revenue for commercial UPAC operators.

### Connection to the RESP and Bidirectional Metering

Any UPAC with potential to export to the public grid requires a connection agreement with the distribution network operator — E-REDES for most of mainland Portugal. The application must include technical information about the installation (capacity, connection point, protection systems) and is subject to a network capacity verification at the relevant low-voltage network node. A bidirectional meter capable of separately measuring consumed and exported energy is mandatory and is typically installed by E-REDES as part of the connection agreement.

### Planning Consent

For most existing buildings, rooftop solar installation is classified as works of limited urban relevance or "prior communication" (comunicação prévia) under the RJUE framework — not requiring a full building permit, provided the installation does not alter the building's protected exterior character. Buildings in Urban Rehabilitation Areas (ARU), protected heritage areas, or subject to specific architectural or conservation designation require prior consultation with the local Câmara Municipal and possibly approval from the DRCC. Flat-roof residential buildings in condominium ownership require an owners' assembly vote approving the installation before any works commence.

## 13. Return on Investment Analysis — The Financial Case for EPDM on Solar Roofs

The upfront cost of a quality EPDM membrane installation is typically 20–30% higher than an equivalent SBS modified bitumen system. For a building owner receiving multiple waterproofing proposals for a 500 m² flat roof, this difference is immediately visible in the quotation comparison. What is not immediately visible is the 30-year total cost of ownership — which is the only financially meaningful time horizon for a building that is about to host a 25–30 year solar investment.

### The Hidden Cost of Membrane Replacement Beneath Installed Panels

Consider a realistic commercial scenario: 500 m² flat-roof warehouse, 80 kWp solar installation, membrane and solar installed simultaneously in Year 0.

If the bitumen membrane is specified: at Year 12–15, the bitumen reaches end of useful service life in the Portuguese climate and begins producing infiltrations. The owner faces two options: defer and accept growing structural damage risk, or replace the membrane. Membrane replacement requires full demounting of the 80 kWp solar array — typically 2 to 3 weeks of work involving both a roofing contractor and an electrical contractor. The demounting and reinstatement cost is typically 30–40% of the original solar installation cost. Lost energy generation during those 3 weeks represents additional unrecoverable revenue and electricity savings. And the replacement membrane — another bitumen system specified for cost — will present exactly the same problem at Year 24–27, potentially within the operational period of the second panel generation.

If EPDM is specified: the membrane installed in Year 0 has a 50-year service life. At Year 25–30, when the first generation of panels reaches end of life and is replaced with next-generation technology, the EPDM membrane beneath is renewed — it may require no intervention at all, or minor maintenance of singular points. The membrane replacement problem simply does not arise during the panels' operational life.

### Illustrative 30-Year Cost Indices (500 m² roof, 80 kWp solar)

| Cost Component | EPDM | SBS Bitumen |
|---|---|---|
| Waterproofing installation (Year 0) | Index 100 | Index 78 |
| Membrane replacement (Year 12–15) | 0 | Index 85 |
| Solar array demounting and reinstatement for membrane replacement | 0 | Index 42 |
| Lost solar generation during works (3–4 weeks) | 0 | Index 15 |
| Maintenance costs over 30 years | Index 8 | Index 24 |
| **30-year total** | **~Index 108** | **~Index 244** |

**Note**: These are illustrative relative indices, not real prices. Index 100 represents the EPDM installation cost for the area and configuration specified. Actual costs depend on project-specific conditions. The solar demounting and reinstatement index is based on Membriko's knowledge of market rates for this category of work.

The 136-index-point difference represents the financial measure of the membrane specification decision for a solar roof. This analysis is presented by Membriko to every client evaluating lower-cost membrane alternatives for a solar integration project.

### Solar Payback Period — Membrane Impact

The typical UPAC payback period for commercial installations in Portugal is 6–9 years at 50–100 kWp scale, based on current electricity tariffs and panel costs. A single membrane replacement event at Year 12–15 — costing the equivalent of 30–40% of the original solar installation — extends the effective payback period by 2–4 years and reduces the net return over 30 years substantially. EPDM, by eliminating this event, maintains the original payback timeline and maximises the net financial return of the solar investment.

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions — Solar Integration on EPDM Roofs

**Can an EPDM membrane support the weight of a ballasted solar mounting system?**

Yes. Standard ballasted systems (ValkBox, ValkAce, FlatFix) impose 15–25 kg/m² of roof area — less than conventional EPDM gravel ballast at 50–80 kg/m². Structural verification of the existing slab or steel deck is always required before any solar installation proceeds. Membriko coordinates with a structural engineer as a mandatory part of the solar integration project specification for every project.

**Can solar panels damage the EPDM membrane during installation?**

Not if the isolation pads are correctly specified and placed, which Membriko ensures. Mounting systems never contact the EPDM membrane directly — the interface is always an EPDM or neoprene pad. Membriko provides the isolation pad specification to the solar installer and has a technician on site during the first day of mount installation to verify correct placement. Post-installation, Membriko inspects all accessible membrane areas before issuing the project handover documentation.

**Can I add solar panels to an existing EPDM roof?**

Yes, subject to a membrane condition survey by Membriko first. If the membrane is in acceptable condition, Membriko documents the current state, repairs any identified deficiencies, tests for watertightness, photographs the bare membrane and issues written clearance for solar installation. If the membrane requires full replacement, Membriko recommends completing this before any solar installation proceeds — protecting the 25–30 year solar investment from the outset.

**Does EPDM's black surface reduce solar panel efficiency compared with white membranes?**

White membranes such as TPO reflect diffuse radiation back to panel undersides, producing a real but modest yield gain of approximately 1–3%. Membriko acknowledges this advantage. In the context of a 30-year solar project, this marginal gain is far outweighed by EPDM's service life advantage — which eliminates the risk of a membrane replacement event that would interrupt generation for 3–4 weeks and cost 30–40% of the original solar installation value.

**What inter-row spacing is required between solar panel rows?**

SCIE regulations and ANPC guidance require minimum 0.9 m access corridors between panel rows on commercial buildings, with a minimum 1.0 m clear perimeter setback from all roof edges and upstands. Membriko produces the fire setback plan as part of the solar integration project specification, coordinating with the solar installer to maximise panel capacity within the compliant area.

**What minimum roof fall is recommended for solar integration?**

Membriko recommends a minimum 1.5% fall for solar roofs — above the statutory 1% minimum under RGEU — to compensate for drainage disruption caused by panel rows concentrating rainwater into inter-row corridors. Where existing roofs have insufficient fall, Membriko installs fall-correction screeds before laying the EPDM membrane. Fall adequacy is assessed as part of the technical roof survey.

**Does the Membriko installation warranty remain valid with solar panels installed?**

Yes. Membriko's 20-year installation warranty applies to EPDM roofs with photovoltaic installations, subject to the solar installer following the isolation pad specification Membriko provides and not executing additional membrane penetrations without prior written approval from Membriko. All warranty conditions are documented clearly in the warranty certificate delivered at project handover.

**How long does the waterproofing phase take before solar panels can be installed?**

For a 200–500 m² commercial flat roof on a new concrete deck: 3–7 working days for EPDM installation and testing. For a retrofit over an existing membrane: add 3–5 days for membrane survey and any repairs required. The Membriko solar coordination inspection after panel installation is complete takes 1 day. Membriko provides a written works programme with every project quotation, so the solar installation timeline can be planned with certainty.

## Membriko — Your Partner for the Full Rooftop Solar Project

Installing solar panels on a flat roof is one of the most sound capital investments a Portuguese building owner can make today. Portugal's irradiance advantage, the maturity of the UPAC regulatory framework, and the continued decline in panel costs combine to produce payback periods and returns that are among the most compelling in Europe.

But the full return of that investment depends on a membrane that will protect the roof — and the solar system above it — for the entire operational life of the panels and beyond. Membriko installs EPDM membrane to industrial quality standards, coordinated precisely with solar mounting system requirements, tested 100% before any panel is placed, and backed by a 20-year installation warranty that covers the complete operational life of the current panel generation.

We operate from Pombal and carry out projects across mainland Portugal. Contact Membriko for a free technical assessment of your roof before your solar installation process begins.
