# Solar Panel Integration on EPDM Roofs — Research Summary

## Application Context

Solar photovoltaic integration on flat roofs represents one of the fastest-growing applications
for EPDM membrane in Portugal and across Southern Europe. The combination of a flat or low-slope
roof with high solar irradiance creates an immediate case for rooftop PV — and the choice of
waterproofing membrane beneath the panels is more consequential than most specifiers realise.

Once solar panels are installed, the waterproofing membrane beneath becomes effectively
inaccessible for maintenance or repair without removing the entire mounting system. Any membrane
failure discovered after panel installation requires mobilising specialist roofers and electricians
simultaneously, often entailing loss of energy generation during the repair period. The lesson of
the sector is unambiguous: specify the waterproofing membrane to last at least as long as the
solar panels — and EPDM's 50+ year service life comfortably exceeds the 25-30 year design life
of photovoltaic modules.

## EPDM Properties Relevant to Solar Integration

**Thermal Performance Under Solar Arrays**

Solar panels create a unique microclimate beneath them. Irradiance that would normally heat the
roof membrane directly is intercepted by the panels, reducing peak membrane temperatures in
shaded zones by 10-20°C compared to exposed areas. However, the panel edges create hot/cold
transition zones where thermal gradients are steeper. EPDM's continuous elastic performance
across -45°C to +150°C is directly relevant: it accommodates differential thermal movement
without cracking at shadow/sun boundaries.

**Chemical Compatibility with Mounting Hardware**

Ballasted solar mounting systems rest directly on the EPDM membrane. The materials in contact
with EPDM include aluminium extrusions, stainless steel fasteners, galvanised steel ballast trays
and rubber isolation pads (typically EPDM or neoprene). EPDM is chemically inert to all these
materials under service conditions. Incompatible contacts — such as certain plasticised PVC
protection mats or petroleum-based lubricants on fasteners — must be avoided and are addressed
in the installation specification.

**Puncture and Compression Resistance**

The compressive loads imposed by ballasted solar mounts range from 0.5 to 1.2 kN per mount foot,
distributed over the contact pad area. EPDM's resistance to point loading depends on thickness
and the substrate below: on a hard concrete substrate, 1.2 mm EPDM resists point loads well;
on compressible insulation, a 1.5 mm minimum or a rigid protection board beneath the membrane
is specified to prevent long-term creep deformation at mount contact points.

## Solar Mounting System Types

### Ballasted Systems (Non-Penetrating)

Ballasted mounting systems are the dominant solution for flat EPDM roofs in Portugal. The
principal systems in the market include:

**ValkBox 3** (Van der Valk Solar Systems)
- Pre-engineered aerodynamic mounting trays with ballast slots
- Wind load calculated by proprietary software (PVsyst / Van der Valk calculator) per EN 1991-1-4
- Concrete ballast blocks typically 25 kg each, placed in defined grid
- Contact with EPDM via pre-attached EPDM or neoprene isolation pads — chemically compatible
- Panel angle: fixed at 10° or 15° (standard configurations)
- Ballast weight typically 15-25 kg/m² of roof area (less than conventional ballasted EPDM
  which uses 50-80 kg/m² of gravel)

**ValkAce** (Van der Valk Solar Systems)
- Landscape-orientation aerodynamic system
- Lower wind resistance profile: reduces ballast requirement by 20-30% compared to ValkBox
- Drainage integrated under panels — critical for maintaining EPDM drainage performance
- Compatible with EPDM membranes; isolation pads included
- Row spacing minimum 600 mm (for maintenance access and fire setback compliance)

**Schletter FlatFix Fusion**
- Modular east-west mounting optimised for maximising panel density per roof area
- East-west orientation: self-ballasting aerodynamic profile
- Low panel tilt (typically 5-15°) reduces wind loads and ballast requirements
- Ideal for large flat roofs in Portugal where density of generation per m² is priority

**Mounting to Substrate Considerations**
For roofs with insufficient structural capacity for ballast, mechanically attached mounts through
the EPDM membrane are possible but create penetrations that must be sealed with:
- Stainless steel flange plates bonded over the EPDM with self-amalgamating tape
- Prefabricated EPDM pipe boots sized to fastener diameter
- Sealant compatibility check: only EPDM-compatible sealants (not silicone in contact with EPDM)

### Penetrating Systems (Structural Attachment)

Used on roofs where wind loads are too high for ballasted systems or structural capacity
is insufficient for ballast weight. Each penetration through the EPDM requires:
- Pre-drill through insulation and deck
- Stainless steel mounting anchor with flanged base plate
- EPDM membrane applied over and bonded to the flange (wrap and seal method)
- Butyl tape and EPDM-compatible sealant at all interfaces
- No exposed fastener shank above the membrane surface

### Hybrid Systems (Perimeter-Fixed, Field-Ballasted)

Perimeter rows receive mechanical fixings to the roof structure; interior rows are ballasted.
Reduces total ballast while managing wind uplift at the most vulnerable roof edge zones.
Requires engineering calculation for each specific roof geometry and wind zone per EC1.

## Portugal Solar Market — Autoconsumo Regulatory Framework

### Decreto-Lei 162/2019 (Autoconsumo de Energia Renovável)

Portugal's principal legislation governing self-consumption of renewable energy, enacted
15 October 2019. Key provisions:

- **UPAC (Unidade de Produção para Autoconsumo)**: Installations designed primarily for
  self-consumption, with up to 100% of production consumed on-site. Excess can be sold to
  the grid at market price (OMIE reference price).
- **UPP (Unidade de Pequena Produção)**: Small production units (up to 30 kW for residential)
  where all energy is sold to the grid at a guaranteed tariff. Less common in the current
  market given improving self-consumption economics.
- **UPAC up to 1 kWp**: Exempt from registration and licensing.
- **UPAC 1-30 kWp**: Simplified registration via SERUP (Sistema Eletrónico de Registo de
  Unidades de Produção) — typically 5-10 working days for certificate.
- **UPAC 30-1,000 kWp**: Full licensing procedure; environmental impact screening may apply.
- **Connection to RESP (Rede Elétrica de Serviço Público)**: Any installation that can export
  to the grid requires RESP connection agreement from the grid operator (E-REDES or EDP
  Distribuição for most of mainland Portugal).
- **Compensation for injected energy**: Surplus generation injected into RESP is compensated
  at 90% of the average OMIE spot price for the month — not a fixed feed-in tariff.

### Licenciamento e Obras

Solar panel installation on existing buildings falls under urban planning regulations (RJUE —
Regime Jurídico da Urbanização e Edificação, DL 555/99 and subsequent amendments). In most
municipalities, rooftop solar panels are classified as "obras de alteração" exempt from building
permit if the building facade character is not altered. However, prior communication (comunicação
prévia) to the Câmara Municipal is typically required for commercial and industrial buildings.
Condominium buildings require assembly approval.

## Fire Safety Regulations — DL 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008

### SCIE (Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios)

Portugal's building fire safety code (Sistema de Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios)
establishes requirements that directly intersect with solar installations on roofs:

**Fire Reaction of the Membrane**
EPDM is classified as Class E under EN 13501-1 (reaction to fire — building products). For
buildings where the roof waterproofing must achieve BROOF(t4) (external fire performance class
for roofs), a mineral ballast protection layer of minimum 25 mm is required over the EPDM
membrane. Solar panels themselves are classified as building products and require documentation
of their reaction to fire class.

**Fire Setback Zones**
NP 4413 (maintenance of fire extinguishers) and SCIE regulations require that access routes
for firefighting are maintained on roofs. In practice, solar panel layouts on commercial buildings
must incorporate:
- Minimum 1.0 m clear perimeter setback from all parapet/upstand edges
- 0.9-1.2 m access corridors between panel rows (varies by ANPC guidance and building category)
- Unobstructed access to all roof-mounted mechanical equipment (HVAC, smoke vents)

Fire setback distances directly influence the maximum PV density achievable per roof area.
The Membriko solar integration specification always includes a fire setback plan coordinated
with the PV system designer.

**Module-Level Requirements**
Solar panels installed in Portugal must carry CE marking and comply with IEC 61215 (crystalline
silicon) or IEC 61646 (thin film) for module qualification. The electrical installation (inverters,
cabling, DC junction boxes) must comply with IEC 62548 (PV array design) and RTIEBT (Portuguese
Low Voltage Electrical Installations Technical Regulations).

## EPDM as the Optimal Solar Base Membrane — Comparative Analysis

### Why EPDM Outperforms Alternatives Under Solar Arrays

**TPO Membranes**
TPO is frequently marketed as "the solar membrane" because its white surface improves panel
operating efficiency by reflecting diffuse radiation back onto panel undersides. However:
- Heat-welded TPO seams under ballasted mounts are inaccessible and cannot be inspected
  post-installation without moving the mounting system
- TPO service life of 15-25 years is shorter than the 25-30 year solar panel design life,
  meaning the membrane will likely require replacement during the panel's operational period
- Membrane replacement under an installed solar array requires full dismounting — a major
  cost and logistical challenge

**PVC Membranes**
Plasticiser migration is a known failure mode of PVC under solar panels. The elevated
temperatures beneath panels (reduced UV but elevated ambient temperature) accelerate
plasticiser volatilisation, particularly in the zones with lowest air circulation. Additionally,
PVC is chemically incompatible with most neoprene isolation pads — the pads can migrate
plasticisers from PVC, creating contact adhesion over time and making the mount difficult
to relocate.

**SBS Modified Bitumen**
Bituminous membranes installed with torch application represent a fire risk during initial
installation on roofs where solar infrastructure (cable conduits, junction boxes) may already
be present. Additionally, bitumen softens at elevated temperatures (> 50-60°C) — achievable
under solar panels in Portugal's summer — causing creep deformation under mount contact points.

**EPDM Advantages Summary**
- Service life exceeds 50 years — outlasts any foreseeable panel replacement cycle
- Elastic recovery prevents creep under sustained compressive loads from mounts
- Chemical compatibility with all standard mounting hardware materials
- Seam adhesive repairs accessible without mount removal (seam tape applied over existing seam)
- Cold-process installation — no flame, no conflict with existing electrical infrastructure
- Dimensionally stable under the combined temperature regime of shaded/unshaded zones

## Maintenance Under Solar Arrays — Key Considerations

**Membrane Inspection Frequency**
Annual visual inspection is recommended for EPDM under solar arrays. The inspection must cover:
- Perimeter flashings and upstand connections (accessible without panel removal)
- Penetration seals at any structural mount anchors
- Drainage channels between rows (accessible via maintenance corridors)
- Panel removal for membrane inspection is only required if water infiltration is detected

**Drainage Performance**
Solar panels create horizontal and vertical flow disruption on the roof surface. Rainwater
collects at panel edges and concentrates into linear drainage paths. The EPDM membrane must
be installed with adequate falls (minimum 1.5% recommended under solar arrays versus 1%
for open roofs) to ensure drainage does not pond at panel edges.

**Biological Growth**
The shaded environment under solar panels is conducive to biological growth (moss, lichen,
algae) on the EPDM surface in humid Atlantic regions of Portugal. EPDM is not damaged by
biological growth — the membrane's chemical inertness extends to humic acids and biogenic
compounds — but growth can interfere with drainage. Annual inspection should include removal
of any significant biological accumulation from drainage paths.

## Structural Considerations

Solar panel systems add dead load to the roof structure. The combined loading of mounting
system and ballast is typically 15-30 kg/m² of roof area (considerably less than conventional
EPDM gravel ballast). However, structural verification is always required:
- Wind uplift calculation per EC1 (EN 1991-1-4) for the specific roof location and panel array
- Dead load assessment per EC1-1 (EN 1991-1-1) for combined ballast and panel weight
- For Portuguese coastal locations, wind exposure category requires careful assessment (Pombal
  is classified as Zone A, coastal areas as Zone B per Portuguese National Annex to EC1)
- Existing roof structures must be assessed by a structural engineer before any solar
  installation proceeds
