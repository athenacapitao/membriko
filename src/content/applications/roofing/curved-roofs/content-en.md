# Curved Roof Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## When Architecture Curves, Conventional Waterproofing Breaks Down

There is a moment in every ambitious building project when the structural engineer's drawings and the waterproofing contractor's experience collide. On flat roofs, that collision is manageable. On curved roofs — barrel vaults spanning industrial warehouses, domes crowning civic buildings, organic free-form canopies shading public squares — it becomes a defining test of whether the waterproofing system was chosen on the basis of genuine technical merit or on the basis of familiarity and habit.

The results of the wrong choice are visible across Portugal. Bituminous membranes stretched beyond their elongation limit, cracking along the tension face of barrel vaults. PVC systems cut into dozens of narrow strips to follow a dome's compound curvature, with heat-welded seams that degrade faster than the field membrane around them. Torch-applied systems installed by applicators working on steep curved surfaces at genuine risk to themselves, producing torch passes that are uneven, inconsistent, and structurally inadequate.

Membriko, based in Pombal and operating across Portugal, was built around a single conviction: that EPDM rubber membrane is the technically correct answer for curved roof waterproofing, and that technical correctness — properly specified, properly installed, properly detailed — produces results that last not for a decade but for a generation. This page explains the reasoning behind that conviction in full, covering the physics of curved surfaces, the geometry of EPDM installation, the construction details that determine long-term performance, and the common errors that Membriko is routinely asked to correct.

## Why EPDM Is the Right Material for Curved Surfaces

The case for EPDM on curved roofs is not made by marketing language. It is made by comparing material properties against the physical demands of curved surface waterproofing. Three properties are decisive.

### Elongation of 300% or More: Conformability That No Thermoplastic Can Match

EPDM — Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer — is a vulcanised synthetic rubber. The vulcanisation process creates cross-linked polymer chains that give the material its characteristic elastic recovery: stretch it, and it returns. The elongation at break of a quality EPDM membrane is typically in excess of 300%. In practical terms, a membrane that is one metre wide can be stretched to four metres before it ruptures — and will return to close to its original dimension when released.

No thermoplastic membrane used in roofing comes close to this figure. PVC typically elongates 15–25% before reaching its yield point. TPO performs similarly. Standard SBS bitumen modified membrane, particularly when aged and cooled, may crack at elongations of well under 10%. These are not abstract statistics — they are the physical explanation for why every curved roof covered with these materials requires extensive cutting, piecing and seaming to follow the geometry, and why every seam on a curved roof is a potential failure point.

Membriko specifies EPDM for curved roofs precisely because it is the only membrane material that can be draped, stretched and formed over a curved substrate — whether a simple barrel vault or a compound-curve dome — and arrive at the other side still elastic, still waterproof, and still performing.

### Temperature Range of -45°C to +130°C: Stability Across All Portuguese Conditions

Curved roofs are, by their geometry, fully exposed. A south-facing barrel vault over a warehouse in the Alentejo reaches membrane surface temperatures in excess of 80°C during summer. The same profile on a north-facing elevation in the mountains of central Portugal endures sub-zero temperatures through the winter months, combined with freeze-thaw cycling that stresses every joint and seal in the system.

EPDM maintains its fundamental properties — elasticity, waterproofing integrity, dimensional stability — across the entire range from -45°C to +130°C. This is not a theoretical claim: it is the direct result of the polymer chemistry of EPDM, which unlike PVC plasticisers does not leach, migrate or degrade under sustained thermal exposure. Membriko selects membrane formulations and adhesive systems for each curved roof project based on the specific thermal exposure profile of that roof, ensuring that the system will perform not just on installation day but through decades of Portuguese climate.

### Single-Sheet Coverage: The Engineering Case Against Seams

EPDM is manufactured in rolls up to 15.25 metres wide and 61 metres long. This makes it possible — and on many curved roofs, entirely practical — to cover an entire surface with a single sheet. A barrel vault spanning 12 metres can be covered from eave to eave in a single piece, with no longitudinal seam at the crown. A modest dome can be stretched and formed from a single sheet, eliminating the compound seam network that any cut-and-piece system requires.

Membriko's project planning begins with a specific objective: minimise field seams. Every metre of seam eliminated is a metre of risk eliminated. Where seams are required — in large domes, complex free-form geometries, or where penetrations demand local reinforcement — Membriko executes them with the full rigour of a primary waterproof joint, not as an afterthought. But the goal is always to use the single-sheet capacity of EPDM to its maximum advantage.

## Types of Curved Roofs: Vaults, Domes, Arches and Free-Form Geometry

The term "curved roof" covers a family of geometrically distinct structures, each with specific waterproofing implications. Membriko works across all of them.

### Barrel Vaults

The barrel vault — also called a cylindrical vault or arched roof — is the most common curved roof form in Portuguese construction. It is defined by a single-curvature profile: the cross-section traces an arc (semicircular, segmental or parabolic), and this arc is extruded along the building's length. Barrel vaults are found on industrial buildings, agricultural stores, sports halls, large retail units and increasingly on contemporary residential buildings where the form is used as an architectural statement.

For EPDM waterproofing, the barrel vault is the most technically straightforward curved roof. The single curvature allows a membrane to be laid longitudinally — running the length of the vault, over the crown, from eave to eave — with a single sheet that eliminates any seam at the most critical point. Membriko approaches each barrel vault with a survey of the arc geometry: the radius, the rise-to-span ratio, the profile at the spring line, and the eave termination condition. These measurements determine the sheet width required, the stretching factor across the crown, and the edge fixing strategy.

### Domes and Hemispheres

Domes introduce double curvature — the surface curves in two perpendicular planes simultaneously. This is geometrically more demanding than a barrel vault, and it is where the elongation capacity of EPDM becomes most visibly valuable. Domes appear on religious buildings throughout Portugal, on civic and cultural buildings, on swimming pool enclosures, on sports arenas and on contemporary architectural projects where the dome form is used to create large column-free interior volumes.

For domes up to approximately 8 metres in diameter, Membriko can frequently achieve single-sheet coverage by stretching a circular or square cut piece over the dome surface, allowing the material's elongation to accommodate the transition from flat sheet to spherical surface. For larger domes, Membriko uses a gore pattern system — geometrically calculated wedge-shaped pieces that, when seamed together, cover the dome surface with controlled, predictable stretch and a minimum number of seams.

### Quonset Structures and Agricultural Arches

The semi-circular corrugated metal building — known internationally as a Quonset hut — is a common feature of Portuguese agriculture and light industry. These structures were typically erected in the latter half of the twentieth century, and many now have corrugated metal profiles that are thinned by corrosion, bolted joints that leak, and no viable waterproofing system at all beyond the deteriorating metal itself.

Membriko has developed a specific approach to Quonset rehabilitation: EPDM applied over the existing corrugated metal profile as a waterproofing overlay. The membrane conforms to the corrugation pattern, adheres with contact adhesive at the high points of the corrugations, and provides a continuous impermeable barrier across the entire surface. The corrugated metal becomes, in effect, the structural substrate for a new high-performance waterproofing system, and the building's useful life is extended by 50 years or more without structural intervention.

### Free-Form and Organic Geometries

The most technically demanding category is the free-form curved roof — a surface with variable, irregular curvature that does not conform to any standard geometric primitive. These structures emerge from contemporary architectural practice: undulating canopies over public spaces, sculptural roof forms on cultural buildings, organic shapes designed to harmonise with landscape. They are the strongest possible argument for EPDM, because EPDM is the only membrane material that can follow an arbitrary curve in three dimensions without being cut into dozens of small pieces.

Membriko approaches free-form curved roofs with detailed geometric survey — using digital models from the architectural team where available — to develop cutting patterns and installation sequences that make the most of the membrane's conformability while planning seam locations at geometrically favourable positions.

## The Physics of Curved Roofs: Wind, Drainage and Structural Movement

Understanding how a curved roof behaves under load is not optional background knowledge — it is the engineering foundation for specifying and installing a waterproofing system that will actually perform.

### Wind Load Distribution on Curved Profiles — EN 1991-1-4

EN 1991-1-4, the Eurocode for wind actions, defines specific pressure coefficients for curved roof geometries including barrel vaults and domes. The behaviour of wind over a curved roof is fundamentally different from its behaviour over a flat or pitched surface, and this difference has direct implications for how a waterproofing membrane must be fixed.

On a barrel vault, the windward side experiences positive pressure (wind pushing the membrane down onto the substrate) at low wind angles, transitioning to negative pressure (suction pulling the membrane away from the substrate) as the wind angle increases. The zone of maximum suction is typically at the spring line — where the curved surface meets the vertical wall — and at the leeward crown. These are precisely the zones that are most difficult to detail and most often under-engineered in practice.

On a dome, the suction pattern is more complex and three-dimensional: maximum suction occurs around the perimeter of the dome at the spring line, with the apex zone experiencing either positive or negative pressure depending on the dome's height-to-diameter ratio. Membriko calculates wind pressure coefficients for each project according to EN 1991-1-4, and uses these calculations to determine fastener spacing in mechanically fixed systems and adhesive area coverage in fully adhered systems.

### Drainage on Curved Surfaces

Water on a curved surface does not follow the straight paths of a flat roof drainage design. It finds the locally lowest point at each position on the surface, creating drainage patterns that depend on the precise geometry, the presence of construction irregularities, and the accumulation of debris that can redirect flow paths over time.

Membriko performs a drainage analysis for every curved roof project before beginning installation. This analysis identifies the natural collection points — the valleys, eave lines, and low-point zones where water will accumulate — and verifies that adequate drainage outlets exist or proposes their installation as part of the waterproofing scope. A curved roof with insufficient drainage outlets becomes a system where the membrane is permanently loaded by standing water, accelerating adhesive fatigue and creating conditions for biological growth that can mechanically damage the EPDM surface.

### Structural Movement and Its Effect on Waterproofing

Curved roof structures move. Concrete barrel vaults undergo thermal expansion and contraction, elastic deflection under live loads (snow, access for maintenance, mechanical plant), long-term creep and, in seismic zones, earthquake-induced displacement. Steel arches move considerably more than concrete under thermal loads, and timber framing introduces moisture-related dimensional changes that are particularly challenging for waterproofing transitions.

EPDM accommodates structural movement through its elasticity, but the transitions between the membrane and rigid elements — parapet walls, lantern lights, mechanical penetrations — must be engineered to permit movement without concentrating stress at a fixed point. Membriko designs all transition details with movement capacity as a primary criterion: termination bars are anchored with appropriate fastener centres to distribute load, flexible accessory components are used at structural joints, and sealants are selected for their long-term elongation capacity rather than their initial adhesion.

## Membriko's Curved Roof Installation Process

No two curved roofs are identical. Every project Membriko undertakes begins with a project-specific installation plan that addresses the particular geometry, substrate, access conditions and technical requirements of that structure. Within this flexibility, the process follows a consistent six-step framework that ensures quality and traceability.

### Step 1: Geometric Survey and Technical Assessment

Membriko begins every curved roof project with a comprehensive site survey. This covers the geometry of the curved surface (radii, angles, surface area, eave and ridge profiles), the condition and composition of the substrate, the location of all penetrations and existing fixtures, the access conditions for installation, and the drainage infrastructure. For rehabilitation projects, the survey extends to condition assessment of the existing waterproofing — identifying failed zones, areas of delamination or cracking, and the state of the substrate beneath.

This survey produces the geometric data that drives all subsequent decisions: the cutting pattern for the EPDM sheet, the location of any required seams, the fastener layout for mechanically fixed zones, and the sequence of installation to avoid trapping workers on completed sections.

### Step 2: Substrate Preparation

The substrate of a curved roof is rarely uniform. Concrete needs cleaning to remove laitance, carbonation, and any contamination from oils or curing agents. Metal substrates require treatment for oxidation and a priming coat to provide adequate adhesion surface. Timber substrates need moisture content verification and structural integrity assessment. Where the existing waterproofing is being replaced, removal must be complete to expose the primary structural substrate, and any areas of moisture damage must be dried, treated and reinstated before new waterproofing is applied.

Surface regularity is checked with a straight edge: deviations greater than 5mm over two metres are filled and regularised before EPDM installation. On curved surfaces, this process requires checking both the cross-sectional profile and the longitudinal profile, since irregularities in either direction can create stress concentrations in the installed membrane.

### Step 3: Cutting Pattern Development

This is the engineering step specific to curved roofs. Membriko develops the precise cutting pattern for the EPDM sheet based on the geometric survey: the dimensions and shape of each piece, the location of seams, the overlap widths required for bonding, and the installation sequence. For a simple barrel vault this may be a single rectangular sheet with small triangular cuts at eave corners. For a complex dome it may be a multi-gore pattern with calculated curved edges. The cutting pattern is documented before any material is cut — cutting errors on large EPDM sheets are expensive.

### Step 4: Thermal Insulation Installation (Where Specified)

Where the project specification includes thermal insulation within the roof build-up, Membriko installs the insulation boards over the prepared substrate before applying the EPDM membrane. On curved surfaces, insulation boards must be cut to follow the curve — boards that bridge across a concave surface leave voids that create point loads on the membrane above. Membriko cuts insulation boards to the profile of the curved substrate and stagger the joints to eliminate linear thermal bridges. Fixings are selected for the substrate type and applied at centres calculated to support the insulation under the membrane loads.

### Step 5: EPDM Membrane Installation

With the substrate prepared and insulation installed, Membriko positions the EPDM sheet over the curved surface according to the cutting pattern plan. For fully adhered systems, the membrane is first laid over the surface and allowed a period of relaxation — typically one to two hours, taking advantage of solar warming where available — allowing the material to begin conforming to the surface geometry under its own weight and elasticity. After relaxation, the membrane is folded back in sections, contact adhesive is applied to both the membrane underside and the substrate, and the membrane is progressively bonded from the geometrically fixed point (crown of a vault, apex of a dome) outward toward the edges. Trapped air is eliminated with a hand roller as each section is bonded.

For mechanically fixed systems, the membrane is positioned, fasteners with load-distributing plates are installed in the engineered pattern, and the overlying sheet covers the fastener row.

### Step 6: Edge Details, Seams and Final Inspection

All perimeter terminations, seams and penetration flashings are executed after the field membrane is in place. Membriko uses EPDM accessories from the same manufacturer as the field membrane — butyl tape, seam tape, pre-formed corners, penetration sleeves — to ensure chemical compatibility and consistent bonding performance. Termination bars are mechanically fixed to the substrate and the joint is sealed with polyurethane sealant. Seams receive a minimum 75mm overlap with contact adhesive and are oversealed with seam tape.

Final inspection covers the entire surface: adhesion is checked by hand pull-test at intervals across the field area, seams are inspected for complete bonding across their full width, and all penetration flashings are checked for tightness. Where required by the project specification, Membriko conducts water ponding tests or electrical spark testing on critical seam areas. The project is not declared complete until the inspection is signed off.

## Conforming Techniques: EPDM Adapting to Any Geometry

The installation of a flat membrane sheet over a three-dimensionally curved surface requires more than just laying the material and pressing it down. Membriko has developed a body of practice in the specific techniques that make the difference between a membrane that sits evenly on a curved surface and one that is permanently stressed, poorly adhered in localised zones, or prone to lifting at the edges.

### Draping and Progressive Bonding for Single Curvature

On barrel vaults and arched roofs with a moderate radius of curvature — generally greater than three metres — Membriko uses a draping and progressive bonding technique. The membrane is positioned at the crown of the vault, anchored there with a temporary fastener, and allowed to drape under gravity toward both eaves simultaneously. This balanced draping ensures that the membrane adopts the curvature uniformly, without creating differential stretch between one side and the other. Progressive bonding then proceeds outward from the crown in both directions, with constant attention to maintaining the even drape before the adhesive contact is made.

### Gore Pattern Planning for Compound Curves

For domes and compound-curve surfaces, the gore pattern is the engineering tool that makes single-sheet coverage impossible but controlled seam coverage achievable. A gore is a wedge-shaped piece of EPDM, wider at the equator and tapering toward the apex, that covers one longitudinal segment of the dome. When multiple gores are seamed side by side, they collectively cover the dome with a controlled amount of stretch in the transverse direction and minimal wrinkle at the apex.

Membriko calculates the number of gores, the width taper, and the curvature of the cut edge for each dome project, using the dome's diameter and height-to-diameter ratio as inputs. The more gores used, the less each individual gore must stretch — a larger number of narrower gores produces a more accurate fit but more seams. Membriko optimises this trade-off for each project, balancing material efficiency, seam count and installation time.

### Adhesion on High-Angle Surfaces

Where the curved surface approaches or exceeds 45° inclination — common at the haunches of tall domes and at the spring line zone of steeply profiled vaults — gravitational peel stress becomes a significant design consideration. The membrane's own weight, combined with any wind suction, creates a sustained downward pull on the adhesive bond. Standard contact adhesives are designed for shear loading, not sustained peel loading, and their performance in this orientation must be evaluated carefully.

Membriko uses high-tack, high-peel-resistance contact adhesives for all surfaces with inclination greater than 45°, applied at higher coverage rates than for horizontal surfaces, with extended open times to allow complete solvent evaporation before contact. Where adhesive alone is assessed as insufficient, mechanical termination bars and supplementary fasteners are incorporated into the detail to provide positive mechanical anchorage against gravitational peel.

---

## Construction Details at Curve Transitions

The transition zones of a curved roof — where the membrane passes from the curved field into a fixed element — are the points of highest technical risk. Membriko identifies four categories of critical detail in curved roof waterproofing.

### The Spring Line

The spring line is the point where the curvature begins — the transition from vertical wall to curved surface. This detail is critical for three independent reasons: it is a zone of geometric change that concentrates membrane stress; it is often a construction joint between different substrate materials; and it is the zone of highest wind suction on most curved roof profiles.

Membriko's standard spring line detail uses a reinforcing EPDM strip bonded over the primary membrane with a minimum 150mm overlap in each direction, with the vertical leg of the strip terminating into a mechanically fixed metal bar that is sealed with compatible sealant. The metal bar provides positive mechanical anchorage against wind suction loads, and the reinforcing strip provides additional thickness and bonded area at the zone of maximum stress concentration.

### Crown and Apex Details

The crown of a barrel vault and the apex of a dome are zones where water from both sides converges and where wind-induced suction is concentrated. Membriko reinforces these zones with additional mechanical fixings and, where a penetration exists at the apex for a lantern light or ventilation element, uses a pre-formed EPDM collar that provides a factory-quality seal around the circular or rectangular element — a seal that cannot be achieved by field-applied sealant alone on a curved surface.

### Dome-to-Drum Wall Transitions

Religious buildings, civic buildings and prestigious commercial structures often feature domes that rise from a cylindrical drum wall. The transition between the spherical dome surface and the vertical drum wall is a geometrically complex junction: the membrane must change direction from a compound curve to a vertical plane, accommodate differential movement between two structurally distinct elements, and maintain watertight integrity at a point that collects water from the entire dome surface above.

Membriko executes dome-to-drum transitions with a purpose-fabricated EPDM gusset that is pre-formed to the curved profile before installation, bonded to both the dome membrane and the drum wall covering, and mechanically fixed with a continuous aluminium termination bar at the drum wall attachment line. The termination bar is sealed with polyurethane sealant and fixed at centres calculated to resist the wind-induced differential movement between dome and drum.

### Penetrations Through Curved Surfaces

A pipe, cable or mechanical support passing through a curved roof faces a different geometric challenge from the same penetration through a flat roof. On a flat roof, the membrane lies in a plane and the penetration passes perpendicular to it. On a curved surface, the membrane is at a variable angle to the penetration, and the membrane around the penetration is under conforming tension in two or more directions simultaneously.

Membriko uses factory-made EPDM pipe boots for circular penetrations, selecting the boot diameter to suit the pipe size and the boot profile to accommodate the surface inclination at the penetration point. For rectangular or irregular penetrations — structural supports, ventilation ducts, maintenance access hatches — Membriko fabricates custom EPDM flashings with minimum 100mm laps to the field membrane in all directions, bonded and mechanically fixed.

## Rehabilitating Historic Curved Roofs with EPDM

Portugal's architectural heritage includes a substantial population of historic curved roofs: the domed churches and chapels that mark almost every town square, the barrel-vaulted industrial buildings of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the arched market halls, the modernist concrete vaults that were an expression of structural confidence in the mid-twentieth century. Many of these structures now have waterproofing systems that are at or well past the end of their designed service life.

Membriko works on historic curved roof rehabilitation with an approach that is distinct from new-build practice. The constraints of heritage buildings — restrictions on substrate modification, requirements for reversibility, sensitivity to the building's cultural and architectural value — shape every technical decision.

### Why Traditional Materials Are No Longer the Answer

Lead sheet was the historic waterproofing material of choice for prestige domed buildings across Europe. It is genuinely conformable, genuinely long-lasting, and genuinely compatible with the stone and brick substrates of historic buildings. The problem is not lead's performance — it is lead's cost, the scarcity of skilled plumbers who can execute the work to a high standard, and the health and environmental restrictions that now govern its use in restoration contexts.

Torch-applied bituminous membrane, often used as an emergency repair material on historic curved roofs, is technically inappropriate for the application (its limited elongation means it cracks at the tension face of any curved surface within a few years) and practically hazardous (open-flame application on buildings with historic timber structures, decorative elements and centuries of accumulated organic material is a genuine fire risk).

### EPDM as a Conservation-Compatible Solution

Membriko proposes EPDM for historic curved roof rehabilitation on the basis of four compatibility criteria.

**Cold installation**: No open flame, no heat, no risk to the historic fabric of the building or its contents. The contact adhesives Membriko uses are solvent-based — adequate ventilation is maintained during application, but there is no flame and no significant heat generation.

**Substrate compatibility**: EPDM is chemically inert with respect to limestone, granite, brick, lime mortar and timber — the materials that make up historic building fabric. Membriko selects primers and adhesives that are compatible with the specific substrate chemistry of each historic building.

**Non-invasive fixing**: Where mechanical fixings are used at spring lines and termination points, Membriko uses minimal-diameter fasteners installed in mortar joints where possible, avoiding drilling into historic stonework. The detail is reversible if future conservation works require removal of the waterproofing.

**Concealment where appropriate**: On historic buildings where the dome or vault surface is finished with ceramic tile, slate, lead or other traditional cladding material, the EPDM membrane is installed as a concealed waterproofing layer beneath the external finish — contributing to waterproof performance without altering the building's appearance.

## Modern Curved Architecture: Pavilions, Sport and Commerce

Contemporary Portuguese architecture has embraced curved forms as a primary expressive vocabulary. The sports pavilion with a sweeping arched steel roof, the shopping centre atrium with a glass and membrane barrel vault, the municipal aquatic centre with a complex folded and curved canopy — these are the new-build curved roofs that Membriko is increasingly involved in from design stage, working alongside architects and structural engineers to specify waterproofing systems that are integrated into the building's geometry from the outset.

### Sports Pavilions and Leisure Centres

Municipal sports pavilions represent a significant portion of Membriko's curved roof work. Portugal invested heavily in sports infrastructure from the 1980s through the 2000s, and many of those buildings now have waterproofing systems — typically SBS bitumen or early-generation PVC — that are at the end of their service lives. A municipal swimming pool or indoor sports hall cannot be closed for six months while a failed roof is replaced: the waterproofing solution must be efficient to install, durable on completion, and, where possible, installed in phases that allow the building to remain partially operational.

Membriko's EPDM system is well suited to phased installation on large barrel vault sports pavilions: the long roll format and single-sheet coverage capacity mean that a large vault section can be completed in a day, with the waterproof zone secured before the end of each working day.

### Contemporary Architectural Projects

Portuguese architecture has produced internationally recognised buildings with complex curved roof geometries — buildings where the roof is not just a functional enclosure but an architectural statement, where waterproofing must be resolved without compromising the visual intention of the design. Membriko works on these projects as a technical partner to the architectural team, not simply as a subcontractor applying a standard system. The starting point is always the geometry: understanding what the architect is trying to achieve, and then finding the EPDM installation approach that makes that geometry waterproof without visible compromise.

## Technical Specifications for Curved Roof Applications

Membriko specifies EPDM membranes compliant with EN 13956:2012, with project-specific requirements for curved roof applications.

| Property | Typical Value | Test Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal thickness | 1.5 mm / 1.8 mm / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 7.5 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Static puncture resistance | ≥ 40 kg | EN 12730 |
| Low temperature flexibility | ≤ -45°C (no cracking) | EN 495-5 |
| Peel adhesion (adhered system) | ≥ 1.5 kN/m | EN 12316-2 |
| Service temperature range | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| Expected service life | 50+ years | — |

For curved roof applications specifically, Membriko applies the following additional requirements:

- **Minimum 1.8mm thickness** for surfaces with inclination exceeding 45°, where installation stress and the risk of substrate irregularity causing membrane damage are higher than on horizontal surfaces
- **Elongation verified at low temperature** (tested at -20°C) for exposed curved roofs at altitude or with northerly orientation
- **Peel adhesion ≥ 2.0 kN/m** for fully adhered systems in wind zones C or above per EN 1991-1-4 Portuguese annex
- **Extended open-time adhesives** for curved roof installations where membrane positioning takes longer than on flat surfaces

## EPDM vs Alternatives on Curved Surfaces

Membriko's position is straightforward: for curved roof waterproofing, EPDM is the technically superior choice in almost all circumstances. The following comparison is presented objectively.

| System | Conformability | Seam Density on Typical Curve | Installation Safety | Durability | 50-Year Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EPDM (Membriko)** | Excellent (≥300% elongation) | Very low — single-sheet on many projects | Cold-applied, no flame | 50+ years | Very low |
| PVC membrane | Moderate (≤25% elongation) | High — narrow rolls require many welds | Hot-air welding | 20–30 years | Moderate |
| TPO membrane | Moderate (≤30% elongation) | High | Hot-air welding | 20–30 years | Moderate |
| SBS bitumen | Poor (low elongation, brittle when aged) | Very high — strips and patches | Torch application — high risk on curves | 15–25 years | High (replacement cycles) |
| Liquid-applied (PU/PMMA) | Excellent (no seams) | None — monolithic | Cold-applied | 10–15 years (requires recoating) | High (maintenance cycles) |
| Metal (lead, copper, zinc) | Good (hand-formed) | High — soldered joints | Safe but very slow | 100+ years | Very high (material and labour) |

### The Liquid-Applied Question

Liquid-applied systems are the only meaningful alternative to EPDM on geometrically complex curved surfaces. A liquid membrane follows any form, has no seams, and can be applied by brush, roller or spray to surfaces that would challenge any sheet membrane. Membriko acknowledges this genuine advantage — and notes the limitations that make liquid systems a supplementary tool rather than a primary answer for curved roofs.

A well-executed liquid applied membrane has a service life of 10 to 15 years before it requires full recoating. Over a 50-year building life, this means three to four complete recoating cycles — each one requiring full surface preparation, scaffolding, and material cost. The cumulative cost of this maintenance cycle exceeds the installed cost of an EPDM system by a substantial margin. Beyond cost, the performance of a liquid system is highly sensitive to substrate preparation — any moisture, contamination or surface irregularity creates a bond failure that leads to blistering or delamination. And controlling application thickness on a curved surface, particularly on steep sections, is genuinely difficult: thin spots compromise waterproofing integrity in ways that are not visible on the day of installation.

Membriko uses liquid-applied products as a complementary tool — for reinforcing complex penetration details, for treating substrate cracks before EPDM installation, and for sealing specific geometric features that are impractical to flash with sheet membrane. As the primary waterproofing system on a curved roof, EPDM delivers better long-term performance at lower total cost.

## Seven Common Errors in Curved Roof Waterproofing

Membriko's rehabilitation work — projects where the company is engaged to diagnose and correct failures in existing waterproofing systems — provides a detailed and often dispiriting catalogue of errors made by others. Seven errors appear with sufficient regularity to be worth documenting here.

### Error 1: Uniform Fastener Spacing Across a Non-Uniform Wind Pressure Surface

The most consequential error on curved roofs is applying a uniform fastener grid without accounting for the non-uniform wind pressure distribution that EN 1991-1-4 prescribes for curved profiles. The spring line zone and the leeward crown typically experience suction pressures 30–50% higher than the field average. A fastener pattern designed for the average load is significantly under-designed in these zones, and membrane lifting typically begins at the spring line within the first year of service.

### Error 2: Under-Thickness Membrane on High-Inclination Surfaces

Using a 1.2mm membrane — entirely adequate for an accessible flat roof with soft walking surface — on a curved roof with sections exceeding 45° inclination creates a system where the membrane is vulnerable to mechanical damage during installation (from the installer's movement over the surface) and from substrate irregularities that create point loads under the membrane's own weight. Membriko specifies 1.8mm as the minimum for any significantly inclined curved surface.

### Error 3: Fixing Before Relaxation

EPDM that is stretched to conform to a curve and then immediately fixed under tension carries a residual stress. As the membrane thermally cycles through Portuguese summers and winters, this residual stress is added to and subtracted from the thermal expansion stress, creating fatigue in the adhesive bond and in the membrane material at fixings and seams. Membriko always allows for a relaxation period after positioning and before final fixing — the cost in time is minimal; the benefit in service life is substantial.

### Error 4: Inadequate Spring Line Detailing

The spring line receives less attention than it deserves in most curved roof projects. It is a zone where the membrane changes direction, the substrate often changes material, wind suction is at a maximum, and any movement between the wall and the vault concentrates. Executing this transition with a simple turn-down and mastic sealant is inadequate — the detail will begin leaking within the first few years of service. Membriko's spring line detail with reinforcing strip and mechanical termination bar is not over-engineering: it is the minimum adequate response to the physical demands of this location.

### Error 5: Wrong Adhesive for the Substrate

Contact adhesive formulations vary significantly in their compatibility with different substrates. An adhesive that performs excellently on smooth concrete will perform poorly on porous limestone or heavily carbonated historic concrete without the appropriate primer. Membriko selects adhesive and primer combinations specifically for each substrate type, based on pull-off testing where the substrate condition is uncertain.

### Error 6: No Drainage Analysis Before Installation

Installing a waterproofing membrane over a curved roof without first analysing the drainage pattern and verifying the adequacy of drainage outlets creates a system that will be permanently challenged by standing water at the low points. Standing water accelerates adhesive degradation, promotes biological growth, and on thermoplastic membranes (including any EPDM seam sealant) can accelerate UV degradation at the waterline. Membriko resolves drainage before the membrane goes down.

### Error 7: Penetrations Treated as an Afterthought

On flat roofs, a penetration is a two-dimensional problem: the membrane in a plane, the pipe perpendicular to it. On a curved roof, it is a three-dimensional problem with variable geometry at every penetration point. Field-applied sealant-only solutions for curved roof penetrations invariably fail within a few winters — the membrane's movement under thermal cycling breaks the sealant bond at one or more points. Membriko uses engineered penetration sleeves as the primary seal for all curved roof penetrations, with sealant as a secondary measure only.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can EPDM cover an entire dome without any seams?**

A: For domes up to approximately 8 metres in diameter, Membriko can often achieve this. A sheet of EPDM can be stretched and formed over a dome of modest size using the material's elongation capacity to accommodate the transition from flat sheet to spherical surface. For larger domes, a gore pattern system is used — geometrically calculated segments that cover the dome with a controlled number of seams. Even with gores, the seam count is dramatically lower than with any alternative membrane system.

**Q: How is EPDM fixed to a curved surface?**

A: Membriko uses three approaches — individually or in combination depending on the geometry and wind exposure. Fully adhered systems use contact adhesive across the full membrane area. Mechanically fixed systems use purpose-made fasteners with load-distributing plates at calculated centres. Ballasted systems use stone or paving on the lower-inclination zones. The choice is determined by the project's wind zone, the surface inclination, and the substrate condition.

**Q: Will EPDM slide down a steeply curved surface?**

A: Not with the correct fixing system. On steeply inclined surfaces — approaching or exceeding 45° — Membriko uses high-peel-resistance adhesives applied at full coverage rates, supplemented by mechanical termination bars at the spring line and any mid-surface anchor lines required by the inclination. The adhesive is selected and applied specifically to resist gravitational peel, not just shear.

**Q: Can EPDM be used to renovate a church dome?**

A: Yes, and this is one of the applications where Membriko's combination of technical capability and experience with heritage constraints is most valuable. EPDM installs cold — no flame, no risk to the historic fabric — and is chemically compatible with historic masonry substrates. On buildings where the dome surface is clad with tiles, slate or lead for appearance, Membriko installs the EPDM as a concealed primary waterproofing layer beneath the cladding. On buildings where the EPDM surface will be visible, it can be finished with a UV-stable coating if the appearance requirement specifies it.

**Q: What thickness of EPDM is recommended for curved roofs?**

A: Membriko's standard specification for curved roofs is 1.5mm for low-inclination surfaces with a smooth, regular substrate; 1.8mm for surfaces with significant inclination (above 30°) or where the substrate has irregularities; and 2.0mm for industrial or agricultural curved roofs where the membrane will be subject to occasional foot traffic or mechanical load. The specification is always confirmed in the project-specific technical assessment.

**Q: How is drainage managed on a curved roof?**

A: Membriko conducts a drainage analysis for every curved roof project before installation begins. This analysis identifies the natural low points and flow paths, checks the adequacy of existing drainage outlets, and proposes any remedial drainage works that are needed. On barrel vaults, drainage typically runs longitudinally to valley gutters at each eave. On domes, drainage is radial — water flows outward and down to a perimeter gutter or parapet overflow. Where drainage is inadequate, Membriko integrates the solution into the waterproofing scope.

**Q: Does EPDM perform adequately against wind on exposed curved roofs?**

A: Yes, when the fixing system is engineered for the specific wind loads. Membriko calculates wind pressure coefficients according to EN 1991-1-4 for the specific curved geometry and the Portuguese wind zone of the project. These calculations determine fastener spacing in mechanically fixed systems and adhesive coverage in fully adhered systems. EPDM correctly specified and installed to these calculations has a proven track record on exposed curved roofs across northern Europe and the Atlantic coast, where wind exposure is significantly more severe than in most of Portugal.

**Q: What does curved roof waterproofing with EPDM cost?**

A: The installed cost per square metre for a curved roof is higher than for a flat roof of the same area, reflecting the additional complexity of installation, the geometric cutting and waste involved, and the time required for detailing at transitions. The relevant comparison, however, is not with a simpler flat roof — it is with the total cost of ownership over 50 years, including all maintenance, inspection and replacement cycles for each system considered. On that basis, EPDM consistently represents the lowest total cost for curved roof waterproofing. Membriko provides detailed, itemised quotations following a technical site visit.
