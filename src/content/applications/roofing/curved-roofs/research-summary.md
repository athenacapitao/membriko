# Curved Roofs (Coberturas Curvas) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Curved roofs — including barrel vaults, domes, arched structures and free-form geometries —
present unique waterproofing challenges that eliminate most rigid or semi-rigid membrane systems
from consideration. The membrane must conform to compound curves, accommodate structural movement
in multiple planes simultaneously, and maintain watertight integrity across a surface where water
drainage paths are complex and variable.

EPDM's elongation capacity (≥300%), flexibility across the full temperature range (-45°C to
+130°C), and availability in large single sheets make it the technically preferred membrane for
curved roof applications. Where PVC, TPO and bituminous membranes require extensive cutting,
piecing and seaming to follow curves — creating dozens of potential failure points — EPDM can
be draped, stretched and formed over complex geometries with minimal or no seams.

## Types of Curved Roofs

### Barrel Vaults
Single-curvature arched roofs, typically semi-circular or segmental in profile. Common in
industrial, agricultural and sports buildings. EPDM is laid longitudinally along the vault and
adhered or mechanically fastened. The single curvature makes this the most straightforward
curved roof type for EPDM application.

### Domes
Double-curvature spherical or near-spherical roofs. Found in religious buildings, observatories,
sports arenas and contemporary architecture. EPDM must accommodate compound curves, requiring
either a single large sheet that is stretched and formed (for smaller domes) or carefully
planned gore sections with sealed seams (for larger domes).

### Free-Form / Organic Shapes
Architecturally designed roofs with irregular, undulating or sculptural profiles. These are
the most challenging waterproofing projects and often the strongest case for EPDM, as the
membrane can be formed to shapes that would be impossible with rigid sheet materials.

### Arched Roofs and Quonset Huts
Semi-circular corrugated metal or concrete arched structures common in agricultural and
military applications. EPDM can be applied over the existing profile as a waterproofing
overlay, conforming to the corrugation pattern.

## Wind Dynamics on Curved Roofs

Curved roofs experience different wind load patterns than flat or pitched roofs. The
aerodynamic profile creates:
- **Negative pressure zones**: Strong suction forces at the windward transition from vertical
  wall to curved roof, and at the leeward edge
- **Positive pressure zones**: Compression on the windward face at certain angles
- **Venturi effects**: Accelerated wind speeds at the apex of barrel vaults

These load patterns require engineered fastening patterns when EPDM is mechanically fixed, with
higher fastener density in zones of peak negative pressure. Fully adhered EPDM systems must use
adhesives with sufficient peel strength to resist sustained wind suction.

EN 1991-1-4 (Eurocode 1: Wind actions) provides calculation methods for wind pressure
coefficients on curved roofs, including specific coefficients for barrel vaults and domes.

## Portuguese Architectural Context

Portugal has a rich tradition of curved roof architecture:
- **Religious architecture**: Domed churches and chapels throughout the country
- **Modernist architecture**: Barrel-vaulted structures from the mid-20th century
- **Contemporary architecture**: Álvaro Siza and Eduardo Souto de Moura designs featuring
  curved roof profiles
- **Agricultural**: Arched storage buildings and greenhouses
- **Industrial**: Barrel-vaulted factory roofs and warehouses

The rehabilitation of historic domed and vaulted structures presents a significant market
opportunity for EPDM, as these buildings often have failing traditional lead, copper or
bituminous waterproofing that must be replaced without altering the external architectural
profile.

## EPDM Technical Advantages for Curved Surfaces

### Elongation and Conformability
EPDM's ≥300% elongation at break allows the membrane to stretch and conform to curved surfaces
without stress whitening, thinning or loss of waterproofing integrity. The membrane recovers
to near-original dimensions when the forming stress is relieved, maintaining uniform thickness
across the curve.

### Single-Sheet Coverage
Large EPDM sheets (up to 15.25 m × 61 m) can cover many curved roof areas without field seams.
On barrel vaults, a single sheet can span the full width of the vault from eave to eave,
eliminating the vulnerable longitudinal seam that would be required with narrower membrane rolls.

### Temperature Flexibility
Curved roofs in Portugal experience the full range of thermal conditions: south-facing curves
can reach 80°C+ in summer; north-facing curves in mountain regions can drop below -10°C in
winter. EPDM's -45°C to +130°C service range provides ample margin for all Portuguese conditions.

### No Flame Installation
Torch-applied bituminous membranes are particularly dangerous on curved surfaces where the
installer's balance and movement are compromised. EPDM is installed with cold adhesive or
mechanical fasteners — no naked flame on the roof.

## Competitors and Limitations

| System | Curved Roof Suitability | Key Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| EPDM | Excellent | Requires skilled detailing at transitions |
| PVC | Moderate — heat weldable seams | Narrow rolls require many seams; poor UV aging |
| TPO | Moderate | Limited elongation; narrow rolls |
| SBS Bitumen | Poor to moderate | Torch installation on curves dangerous; limited stretch |
| Liquid applied (PU) | Good for complex shapes | 10-15 year recoating cycle; substrate prep critical |
| Metal (lead, copper, zinc) | Traditional for domes | Very expensive; heavy; skilled craft labour scarce |

## Research Gaps

- No published study specifically addresses EPDM performance on curved roofs in Mediterranean
  climates
- Wind pressure coefficients for complex free-form curved profiles are not fully covered by
  EN 1991-1-4 and may require CFD modelling
- Limited published guidance on EPDM adhesive performance on curved substrates under sustained
  gravitational peel stress (relevant for steep dome surfaces)
