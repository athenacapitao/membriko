# Curved Roofs — Page Structure

## Unique Layout: 14 Sections

This page structure emphasizes EPDM's unmatched flexibility and conformability as the key
differentiator for curved, domed and arched roof waterproofing. The architectural heritage
angle connects with Portuguese cultural values while the technical content addresses engineers.

### Section 1: Hero — "Quando a Arquitetura Curva, o EPDM Acompanha"
- **Visual**: Dramatic image of a barrel vault or dome covered with EPDM
- **Stats**: ≥300% Elongation | -45°C to +130°C | Single-Sheet Coverage | 50+ Years

### Section 2: The Challenge — Why Curved Roofs Defeat Conventional Membranes
- Rigid membranes cannot follow compound curves without cutting and piecing
- Multiple seams = multiple failure points on a surface where water paths are unpredictable
- Torch application on curved surfaces = safety risk

### Section 3: EPDM's Superpower — Flexibility That Follows Any Geometry
- ≥300% elongation explained in practical terms
- Single-sheet draping over barrel vaults
- Temperature flexibility for exposed curved surfaces

### Section 4: Types of Curved Roofs and EPDM Solutions
- Barrel vaults, domes, arches, free-form, Quonset huts
- Each type with specific EPDM application approach
- Visual cross-sections of each type

### Section 5: Wind Dynamics on Curved Profiles
- Aerodynamic pressure distribution on curves
- Negative pressure zones and fastener engineering
- EN 1991-1-4 wind load calculations

### Section 6: Membriko's Curved Roof Installation Process
- Custom approach for each geometry type
- Substrate assessment, template development, EPDM forming, edge detailing
- 6-7 step process with quality gates

### Section 7: Conforming Techniques — How EPDM Adapts
- Draping and stretching for single curvature
- Gore pattern planning for compound curves
- Adhesion on steep curved surfaces
- Pre-forming and relaxation techniques

### Section 8: Construction Details at Curve Transitions
- Where curve meets wall (spring line)
- Ridge/apex detailing on barrel vaults
- Dome to drum wall transitions
- Penetrations through curved surfaces

### Section 9: Historic Building Rehabilitation
- Portuguese heritage curved roofs (churches, palaces, historic buildings)
- EPDM as replacement for failing lead/copper/bitumen
- Conservation-compatible installation methods
- Case examples

### Section 10: Modern Curved Architecture
- Contemporary Portuguese architecture
- Sports pavilions, exhibition halls, commercial buildings
- Free-form architectural roofs

### Section 11: EPDM vs Alternatives on Curved Surfaces
- Comparison table focused on conformability, seam count, safety, durability
- Why liquid applied is the only real competitor (and its limitations)

### Section 12: Technical Specifications
- Standard EPDM specs plus curved-roof-specific properties
- Peel adhesion values, elongation recovery, flexibility at low temperature

### Section 13: Common Mistakes on Curved Roof Waterproofing
- 7 errors specific to curved applications
- Under-engineering wind fastening, insufficient adhesion on steep curves, etc.
