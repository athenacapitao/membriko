# Cool Reflective Roofing with White EPDM Membrane | Membriko Portugal

## The Overheating Problem: Portuguese Roofs in Summer

Stand on any flat-roofed industrial building in the Alentejo on a clear July afternoon and press a contact thermometer to the membrane surface. The reading will sit between 70°C and 85°C. On extreme heat wave days — and Portugal has recorded maximum ambient temperatures above 47°C in recent years — surface temperatures on dark-coloured membranes can exceed 90°C. These are not edge-case values. They are the routine thermal reality that millions of square metres of Portuguese roofing endure every summer, and they have consequences that reach directly into energy bills, occupant health, building longevity, and urban climate.

The physics is straightforward. A conventional dark roofing membrane — EPDM black, modified bitumen, dark-coloured fibre cement — absorbs 90% to 95% of incident solar radiation. That absorbed energy becomes heat, which conducts through the building envelope and into the interior space. For a single-storey warehouse in Évora with 3,000 m² of dark roof and no mechanical cooling, the roof surface acts as a radiant heater that keeps the interior unusable for human occupation through the core summer months. For a commercial building in Lisbon with air conditioning, the overheated roof is the single largest parasitic heat load the cooling system must overcome — and overcoming it costs energy, money, and carbon.

Membriko, based in Pombal at the geographic centre of Portugal, has been installing EPDM rubber membranes across the country for years. We apply EPDM black to the majority of projects — it is the right material for waterproofing in almost all applications. But for clients who want to simultaneously waterproof and manage solar heat gain, we install white EPDM: a membrane with the same exceptional waterproofing performance and 50-year service life as our standard product, combined with a solar reflectance of 0.80 to 0.85 that returns the majority of incident solar radiation to the sky rather than absorbing it into the building.

This page sets out the engineering behind cool roofs, the technology that makes white EPDM the best-performing reflective membrane available for Portuguese conditions, the energy savings you can realistically expect, and how Membriko installs reflective roofing to the same standards it applies to every project. The case rests on data, not on marketing.

## What Is a Cool Roof? The Science of Solar Reflectance

A cool roof is any roofing system designed to reflect a high proportion of incoming solar radiation and to emit absorbed heat efficiently back to the atmosphere, rather than transferring it into the building below. The concept sounds simple; the engineering is precise. Three quantities define cool roof performance: solar reflectance, thermal emittance, and the Solar Reflectance Index (SRI).

### Solar Reflectance

Solar reflectance — also called albedo — is the fraction of incident total solar radiation (including ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths) that a surface reflects away from itself, expressed as a value from 0 to 1. A perfectly black body would have a solar reflectance of 0; a perfect mirror would have a reflectance of 1. In practice, roofing materials occupy a wide range:

- Conventional black EPDM membrane: 0.06 to 0.09 (absorbs 91–94% of solar radiation)
- Aged dark modified bitumen: 0.05 to 0.10
- Unglazed clay tile (red): 0.10 to 0.35 depending on colour and weathering
- White EPDM (Carlisle Sure-White, Elevate EcoWhite): initial reflectance 0.80 to 0.85

The significance of this range is not abstract. A surface absorbing 93% of incident solar radiation at 800 W/m² peak irradiance is receiving and retaining 744 watts of heat energy per square metre. A surface reflecting 83% of the same irradiance is retaining only 136 watts per square metre. The difference — 608 watts per square metre — is a thermal load that must either be managed by the cooling system or experienced as elevated interior temperature by building occupants.

### Thermal Emittance

Thermal emittance measures how efficiently a surface radiates heat back to its surroundings as long-wave infrared radiation. It is expressed as a value from 0 to 1, where 1 represents an ideal blackbody radiator. High thermal emittance is desirable for cool roofs: it means that the heat a surface does absorb is efficiently re-radiated to the atmosphere rather than conducted into the building structure. Most roofing materials — including white EPDM — have thermal emittances in the range 0.85 to 0.90, which is high and therefore favourable.

### Solar Reflectance Index (SRI)

The Solar Reflectance Index is a single metric that combines solar reflectance and thermal emittance into a performance rating calibrated so that a standard black surface equals SRI = 0 and a standard white surface equals SRI = 100. Values above 100 are achievable. The SRI calculation method is defined in ASTM E1980.

For regulatory purposes — most importantly LEED certification — low-slope roofs (pitch ≤ 2:12) must achieve a minimum SRI of 82 (LEED v4 and v4.1, based on the three-year aged CRRC value) to qualify for the Heat Island Reduction credit. White EPDM installed by Membriko achieves an initial SRI of 100 to 110 and an aged SRI (after three years of weathering per CRRC methodology) of 80 to 87 — meeting the LEED threshold and far exceeding the performance of any dark roofing surface.

The practical translation of these SRI values: a surface with SRI 100 reaches a thermal equilibrium temperature 28°C to 33°C lower than a surface with SRI 0 under the same irradiance conditions. In Portuguese summer conditions, this means the white EPDM membrane that Membriko installs operates at 35°C to 45°C while the adjacent black membrane sits at 75°C to 85°C. A 30°C to 40°C reduction in surface temperature is the physical foundation of all the energy and comfort benefits that follow.

## White EPDM: The Technology Behind the Reflectance

Standard roofing-grade EPDM is black. This colour is not cosmetic — it results from the compounding of 30 to 40 parts per hundred rubber (phr) of carbon black into the polymer. Carbon black serves two essential functions: it reinforces the mechanical properties of the rubber (increasing tensile strength and tear resistance significantly relative to unfilled EPDM), and it acts as a UV absorber that intercepts ultraviolet radiation before it can attack the polymer backbone, protecting the material from photodegradation.

White EPDM replaces carbon black with titanium dioxide (TiO₂) as the primary filler and UV-management agent. TiO₂ is the white pigment of the coatings and plastics industries — its exceptionally high refractive index (2.50 for the anatase crystal form, 2.71 for rutile) produces the light scattering that creates opacity and whiteness. In the rutile crystal form incorporated into white EPDM, TiO₂ provides both a reflective surface and UV protection for the polymer — the latter through UV absorption and scattering rather than the UV absorption mechanism of carbon black.

The result is a membrane with the same fundamental polymer chemistry as black EPDM — the same saturated ethylene-propylene backbone, the same ENB diene monomer for vulcanisation sites, the same three-dimensional cross-linked rubber network — and therefore the same structural durability, flexibility, and chemical resistance across its service life.

### Carlisle Sure-White EPDM

Carlisle Sure-White is the global reference product for white EPDM roofing membranes, with more than 25 years of documented field performance. Available in 60-mil (1.52 mm) and 90-mil (2.29 mm) nominal thicknesses, it is manufactured in conformance with ASTM D4637 Type I — the American standard for unreinforced EPDM membranes. The aged SRI of Sure-White, measured after the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) accelerated weathering protocol, is 87. This aged value — rather than the initial catalogue value — is the relevant number for energy performance calculations and regulatory compliance, because it represents the membrane's long-term steady-state performance rather than its condition on the day it leaves the factory.

### Elevate EcoWhite EPDM

Elevate (formerly Firestone Building Products) offers EcoWhite EPDM as its premium white membrane product for the EMEA market. The 90-mil formulation carries a 40-year material warranty option — a statement of manufacturer confidence in the product's long-term performance that is not matched by any thermoplastic white membrane available in Portugal. Membriko works with both Carlisle and Elevate as supply partners, selecting the appropriate product for each project based on the technical specification, available sheet dimensions, and client warranty requirements.

### How White EPDM Ages

A candid technical briefing on white EPDM must address ageing honestly. In the first two to five years of service, solar reflectance will decrease from the initial factory value (0.80–0.85) to the aged steady-state value (0.65–0.72) as soiling, biological growth, and limited surface oxidation accumulate. This is not unique to EPDM — all white roofing membranes experience this initial decline. The relevant comparison is not between brand-new white EPDM and brand-new black EPDM, but between white EPDM in its steady-state aged condition and the dark alternative. An aged white EPDM with SRI 80 to 87 continues to deliver substantial energy savings relative to any dark surface. Membriko presents this information clearly in every proposal involving white EPDM, so that client expectations and financial projections are based on the realistic long-term performance of the system, not on idealised initial values.

## Energy Savings: Real Numbers for Portugal

The energy saving potential of a cool roof depends on building type, existing insulation levels, HVAC system characteristics, building occupancy, and climate zone. Membriko does not offer a single generic savings figure — instead, we provide project-specific estimates based on the relevant variables for each building. The figures below represent well-founded ranges based on published research, European field studies, and climate analysis for Portuguese conditions.

### Cooling Energy Reduction

For single-storey buildings — warehouses, industrial units, logistics facilities, hypermarkets, agricultural structures — where the entire roof surface is exposed to direct solar irradiance, studies consistently document cooling energy reductions of 20% to 30% following installation of a reflective roof. This is the category of building where cool roofs deliver maximum benefit, because the roof represents 100% of the upper building envelope and there are no floors above to buffer the solar heat gain.

For multi-storey buildings, the cool roof effect is proportional to the roof's contribution to the total building envelope. For a three-storey office building, only the top floor is directly affected; the building-level cooling energy reduction may be 8% to 12%, but the top-floor improvement in thermal comfort can be dramatic — particularly in open-plan offices under an uninsulated or poorly insulated flat roof.

Peak cooling load reduction — the reduction in the maximum instantaneous cooling demand during the hottest hours of the day — typically runs between 10% and 15% even for multi-storey buildings. This peak reduction is commercially valuable because it may allow HVAC systems to be downsized when they are replaced, and because time-of-use electricity tariffs in Portugal charge the highest rates during the peak hours (09:00–21:00 on working days, with a superpeak midday period) that coincide exactly with maximum solar irradiance.

### Financial Savings Estimates for Portuguese Climate Zones

Using Portuguese regional solar irradiance data, cooling degree day values, and current commercial electricity prices in Portugal (€0.12 to €0.18/kWh for commercial and industrial consumers), Membriko's energy analysis produces the following indicative annual savings ranges:

**Algarve and coastal Alentejo (Faro, Portimão, Beja):** €3.50 to €5.00 per m² of roof area per year. The Algarve is the zone of maximum cool roof benefit in Portugal — global horizontal irradiance of 1,900 to 2,100 kWh/m²/year, approximately 900 cooling degree days (base 18°C), and summer ambient temperatures that regularly exceed 35°C for weeks at a time.

**Greater Lisbon and Setúbal peninsula:** €2.50 to €4.00/m²/year. Lisbon has GHI of 1,700 to 1,800 kWh/m²/year and approximately 600 cooling degree days — strong cool roof benefit, particularly for the dense urban building stock where the urban heat island amplifies cooling demand beyond the regional climate average.

**Centre (Santarém, Leiria, Coimbra, Castelo Branco):** €2.00 to €3.50/m²/year. This is Membriko's home region. The centre of Portugal has GHI of 1,600 to 1,700 kWh/m²/year and significant summer heat periods, with the interior experiencing extreme temperatures in July and August.

**Porto and the northern coastal zone:** €1.50 to €2.50/m²/year. Northern Portugal has lower irradiance (GHI 1,400 to 1,600 kWh/m²/year) and fewer cooling degree days (200 to 300 at base 18°C). White EPDM still saves energy in summer, but the annual savings are lower and the balance with marginal winter heat gain loss must be considered — particularly for residential buildings that are heated throughout winter.

### Payback Period

The material cost premium of white over black EPDM is approximately €1 to €3/m² depending on thickness and manufacturer. Installation costs are identical. At a conservative annual saving of €2/m²/year for a centre-Portugal application, the payback on the material premium alone is one to three years. In the Algarve at €4/m²/year savings, payback is even faster. Over the 40 to 50 year service life of the EPDM membrane, the energy savings far exceed the initial cost of the building — making white EPDM one of the highest-return investments available in building envelope improvement.

## The Urban Heat Island Effect and Cool Roofs

The overheating of individual rooftops is not merely a private problem: it aggregates into a public health issue that Portuguese cities are increasingly recognising in their climate adaptation strategies.

### How Dark Roofs Heat Cities

The urban heat island (UHI) effect is the systematic temperature elevation of urban areas relative to surrounding rural land, caused by the replacement of vegetation and natural soil with low-albedo artificial surfaces — tarmac roads, concrete pavements, dark rooftops. Rooftops typically account for 20% to 30% of the total horizontal surface area of a dense city. When these rooftops collectively absorb 90% of incident solar radiation and re-emit it as convective and radiative heat to the urban atmosphere, they contribute directly and measurably to the temperature elevation of the ambient air.

Research published by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the European Environment Agency, and urban climate research groups documents UHI magnitudes of 1°C to 3°C above rural surroundings for major European cities. During heat wave events — which are becoming more frequent, more intense, and longer-lasting in Portugal under observed climate trends — the UHI can add 5°C to 8°C to nocturnal temperatures, preventing the building thermal mass from cooling overnight and trapping heat in the urban fabric.

### Cool Roofs as Urban Climate Infrastructure

Urban climate modelling indicates that widespread adoption of highly reflective roofing (albedo ≥ 0.65) across a city's rooftop stock can reduce mean urban air temperature by 0.3°C to 1.0°C. In the specific geography of Portuguese cities — narrow streets, dense building fabric, limited green space in historic centres — the potential is towards the upper end of this range. A 0.5°C reduction in mean summer temperature in Lisbon or Porto is not a cosmetic improvement: it translates into measurable reduction of heat-related excess mortality, lower peak electricity demand from the grid, and improved outdoor thermal comfort during the hours when people walk, cycle, and use public spaces.

Lisbon's Municipal Climate Adaptation Strategy identifies increasing the albedo of urban surfaces — rooftops and pavements — as a priority mitigation measure for urban overheating. Porto's Climate Action Plan similarly targets improvements in urban surface reflectance. Each white EPDM installation that Membriko completes contributes, in aggregate, to this urban-scale outcome — turning an individual building investment into a piece of city climate infrastructure.

### Portugal's Accelerating Climate Risk

Portugal is among the European countries most exposed to increasing heat stress under climate change projections. Scenarios consistent with Paris Agreement trajectories project mean summer temperature increases of 1.5°C to 2.5°C above pre-industrial baselines for Portugal by mid-century, with more severe scenarios projecting above 3°C. The frequency of extreme heat events (days above 40°C ambient) is projected to increase significantly. Cool roofing is not merely an economic efficiency measure in this context: it is a component of the physical adaptation that Portuguese buildings will need to remain habitable and productive through the summer conditions that lie ahead.

## Membriko's Cool Roof Installation Process

White EPDM is installed using the same three professional methods that Membriko applies to all EPDM roofing work: fully adhered, mechanically fastened, and ballasted. The method selection follows the same technical logic — structural deck type, wind uplift design load, substrate condition, and future accessibility requirements — with some additional considerations specific to reflective surface management.

### Fully Adhered Installation

In the fully adhered method, the white EPDM membrane is bonded across its entire area to the substrate — typically rigid thermal insulation (EPS, PIR, or mineral wool board) in new construction, or a prepared existing substrate in reroofing. Neoprene contact adhesive (Carlisle Bonding Adhesive or Elevate equivalent) is applied to both the membrane underside and the substrate surface, allowed to reach the correct tack level, and then the membrane is laid into the adhesive bed and pressed firmly with a roller.

Membriko's preference for fully adhered installation on wind-exposed rooftops — coastal Atlantic buildings, exposed high-rise rooflines, buildings at altitude — is based on the distribution of wind uplift resistance across the entire bonded area rather than concentrating it at fastener points. For white EPDM specifically, the installation team takes additional care to protect the reflective surface from contact adhesive contamination: adhesive marks on the white surface are difficult to remove and create localised reductions in solar reflectance. Membriko equips installation crews with shoe covers and establishes controlled circulation zones on the membrane surface throughout the installation process.

### Mechanically Fastened Installation

In the mechanically fastened method, the white EPDM membrane is secured to the structural deck using engineered fastener assemblies — steel screws driven through large-diameter load-bearing plates positioned in the seam overlap zones between adjacent membrane sheets. The fastener plates are concealed beneath the QuickSeam tape, maintaining watertight integrity. Fastener spacing is calculated based on the wind uplift design load defined by Eurocode 1 (EN 1991-1-4) and the measured or tabulated pull-out resistance of the fasteners in the specific deck material.

This method is particularly well suited to metal-deck industrial buildings — warehouses, logistics centres, agricultural structures — where reflective roofing delivers the largest energy and financial return. Membriko calculates fastener patterns from engineering principles, not from generic tables, ensuring that wind uplift design is correctly addressed for each building's location and exposure.

### Ballasted Installation and White EPDM Considerations

In the ballasted method, the white EPDM membrane is placed loosely over a geotextile separation layer and held in place by the weight of rounded gravel ballast or precast concrete paving units. For cool roof applications, Membriko discusses the specific implications of ballast with each client: conventional rounded gravel ballast in grey or natural colours will cover most of the white membrane surface, significantly reducing the exposed reflective area and therefore the cool roof benefit. Where both waterproofing longevity and reflective performance are priorities, Membriko can specify light-coloured concrete paving slabs (white or pale grey concrete, placed on proprietary support pads) that maintain a light-coloured upper surface while allowing sub-slab ventilation. This approach preserves the waterproofing benefit of ballasted installation while retaining a meaningful cool roof effect.

### Quality Verification and SRI Documentation

Membriko's quality control process for white EPDM installations includes the standard seam inspection protocol — 100% probe testing of all seam lengths, visual inspection of all termination details and penetration flashings — plus a post-installation surface inspection confirming that the reflective surface is free of adhesive contamination, excessive scuff marks, or mechanical damage. Where the client requires SRI verification for LEED or BREEAM certification purposes, Membriko provides the CRRC-rated product data sheets and can coordinate measurement of installed surface reflectance using portable spectrophotometry equipment in conjunction with accredited test laboratories.

## White vs Black EPDM: A Decision Guide for Portugal

The choice between white and black EPDM is not a default. It requires analysis of the specific building, climate zone, and energy use pattern. Membriko applies the following framework — honestly and without bias towards either product, since the cost differential is modest and the goal is always the best technical outcome for the client.

### Where White EPDM Is Clearly the Right Choice

**Cooling-dominated buildings in southern and central Portugal.** Any building south of the Tagus river, and most buildings in central Portugal, will have an annual energy balance dominated by cooling demand. Summer months are numerous, hot, and intensely sunny; winter heating demands are moderate to low. In this thermal context, the solar heat gain reduction provided by white EPDM reduces cooling energy consumption throughout the entire summer period, with negligible penalty in winter because solar gains through the roof contribute very little to winter heating in well-insulated buildings.

**Single-storey industrial, commercial, and agricultural buildings.** Warehouses, distribution centres, factory halls, hypermarkets, agricultural sheds: these are the buildings where the cool roof effect is greatest, because the entire building envelope is roofing and there is no buffer of upper floors. A 25% reduction in cooling energy for a 5,000 m² warehouse roof represents a very large absolute saving.

**Buildings without mechanical cooling.** Where there is no air conditioning, a cool roof reduces interior temperature directly — potentially making the difference between a space that can be used productively through the summer and one that cannot. For unheated warehouses used for temperature-sensitive goods (wine, olive oil, pharmaceutical logistics), a cool roof can be the difference between product loss and product integrity.

**Visible urban rooftops contributing to UHI mitigation.** Beyond the individual building economics, a white EPDM roof in a Portuguese city contributes to urban albedo improvement. For clients with sustainability commitments or reporting obligations, this is a quantifiable co-benefit.

### Where Black EPDM Remains the Better Choice

**Heating-dominated buildings in northern Portugal at altitude.** In areas above approximately 800 metres of altitude in the Serra da Estrela, Trás-os-Montes, or Beira Alta — where winters are long, cold, and sometimes snowy, and summers are short and moderate — the balance of heating and cooling demands can favour a membrane that absorbs solar radiation. Black EPDM absorbs the sun's warmth in winter and spring, providing a marginal contribution to the building's heating energy balance. Membriko calculates this balance project by project for clients in these regions.

**Covered applications.** When the membrane will be covered by ballast gravel, a green roof growing medium, or photovoltaic panels occupying the majority of the roof area, the membrane's colour has no bearing on the building's thermal performance. Standard black EPDM is the correct and most economical choice in these configurations.

**Under-tile applications.** When EPDM serves as secondary waterproofing beneath a pitched roof tile system, the membrane's reflectance is irrelevant. Black EPDM is standard and appropriate.

### Regional Guidance

| Region | Recommendation | Key Data |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Algarve | White — strongly preferred | GHI 1,900–2,100 kWh/m²/yr; ~900 CDD |
| Alentejo | White — strongly preferred | GHI 1,800–1,900 kWh/m²/yr; very hot summers |
| Greater Lisbon | White — recommended | GHI 1,700–1,800 kWh/m²/yr; ~600 CDD |
| Centre (Pombal, Leiria, Coimbra) | White — recommended for most buildings | GHI 1,600–1,700 kWh/m²/yr |
| Porto and northern coast | Case-by-case analysis | GHI 1,400–1,600 kWh/m²/yr; ~200–300 CDD |
| Northern interior above 800m | Black may be preferable | Heating-dominated; lower irradiance |

## Cool Roofing in the Portuguese Climate

Portugal occupies one of the highest solar irradiance positions in Western Europe — a consequence of its latitude, its predominantly clear-sky summer weather patterns, and its position on the western edge of the Iberian anticyclone. Understanding the irradiance and temperature profile of each Portuguese climate zone is essential for correctly quantifying cool roof benefit.

### The Algarve and Southern Coast: Maximum Benefit Zone

The Algarve is the cool roof capital of Portugal. With global horizontal irradiance of 1,900 to 2,100 kWh/m²/year — comparable to North Africa and exceeding the best locations in southern Italy and Greece — and approximately 3,100 sunshine hours per year, the Algarve presents the most compelling financial case for reflective roofing in continental Europe west of Spain. Cooling degree days at base 18°C exceed 900 in Faro; the cooling season runs from May through October with peak demand in July and August. A cool roof in Faro delivers roughly twice the energy savings of an identical installation in Hamburg, and measurably more than in Barcelona or Rome.

The Algarve building stock presents Membriko with a range of cool roof opportunities: villas and apartment buildings where occupant comfort in summer is the primary driver; tourist accommodation and hospitality facilities where cooling cost management is a business imperative; and agricultural and agro-industrial buildings — packhouses, olive oil mills, wine storage facilities — where temperature control is critical to product quality.

### The Alentejo Interior: Heat and Scale

The Alentejo combines high irradiance (GHI 1,800 to 1,900 kWh/m²/year) with the most extreme ambient temperatures of any Portuguese region — 40°C and above is recorded at Évora and Beja on multiple days per summer, with peaks above 45°C during intense heat waves. The Alentejo building stock is dominated by large-footprint agricultural and agro-industrial facilities — wine cooperatives, olive processing plants, grain storage warehouses — where cool roofing delivers the greatest absolute energy savings per installation. Membriko has direct experience with this building type across the Alentejo, and understands the specific installation conditions (large unobstructed expanses, metal deck structures, long working days in extreme heat) that cool roof installation in this region demands.

### Greater Lisbon: Urban Density and UHI Amplification

Lisbon and its metropolitan area present a different profile from the rural south: high building density, significant urban heat island effect, a mixed building stock ranging from historic residential terraces to modern commercial and office developments, and a growing regulatory emphasis on sustainable construction. GHI of 1,700 to 1,800 kWh/m²/year and approximately 600 cooling degree days place Lisbon firmly in the zone of significant cool roof benefit.

For Lisbon specifically, the UHI amplification of cool roof savings is material. A city-scale modelling study of Lisbon's urban heat island estimated the UHI magnitude at 1.5°C to 2.5°C above the surrounding rural area during summer nights. A building in central Lisbon with a conventional dark roof is experiencing both the regional climate and this additional urban warming — meaning its cooling load is higher than a building in an equivalent suburban or rural location. White EPDM installed by Membriko on a Lisbon commercial building reduces both the direct solar absorption through the roof and the building's contribution to the UHI that elevates the ambient air temperature around it.

### Porto and the North: A Balanced Assessment

Northern Portugal receives GHI of 1,400 to 1,600 kWh/m²/year — 20% to 30% less than the Algarve, and comparable to northern Spain rather than southern France. Cooling degree days at base 18°C are 200 to 300 in Porto, roughly one-third of Faro's value. This does not mean white EPDM is without benefit in the north — it still saves cooling energy in the summer months — but the annual financial return is lower, and the case must be made on the specific building's energy use pattern rather than assumed from regional climate data alone.

For buildings in Porto and the north that have cooling-dominated energy use regardless of climate — data centres, food retail, pharmaceutical logistics — white EPDM remains the correct technical choice. For residential buildings that are heated throughout winter and only lightly cooled in summer, the trade-off between summer cooling savings and marginal winter heat gain loss deserves analysis. Membriko provides this analysis as part of the proposal process for any northern Portugal project where the choice is not obvious.

## Energy Regulations and Cool Roofs

Reflective roofing is not merely a good idea — it is increasingly a response to regulatory requirements and certification frameworks that affect building permitting, energy certification, and asset value in Portugal.

### EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)

The recast EPBD (Directive 2024/1275/EU) entered into force in 2024 with the most ambitious energy performance requirements for buildings yet established at European level. The directive sets a trajectory towards a zero-emissions building stock by 2050, with interim milestones requiring progressive improvement in the energy performance of the existing building stock through renovation. Cool roofs contribute directly to EPBD compliance by reducing the energy demand for space cooling — which, in Portugal, is a primary determinant of building energy class in the summer months and is growing as a share of total building energy consumption with rising summer temperatures.

### Portuguese Energy Performance Regulations (REH and RECS)

The Regulation for Energy Performance of Residential Buildings (REH, Decreto-Lei n.º 118/2013 as amended) and the Regulation for Energy Performance of Commerce and Services Buildings (RECS) both include roof thermal characteristics in the building energy calculation. The solar absorptance of the outer roof surface affects the calculation of solar heat gain through the roof — a parameter directly included in the energy balance. A cool roof with high solar reflectance reduces the solar heat gain factor, improving the calculated cooling energy demand and potentially shifting the building's energy rating upward.

Membriko provides the thermal performance data for installed white EPDM membranes — including solar reflectance and thermal emittance values from CRRC product ratings — in a format suitable for use by qualified energy experts (peritos energéticos) preparing Energy Performance Certificates (Certificados de Desempenho Energético) under the SCE system.

### LEED Certification

LEED v4 and v4.1 include the Heat Island Reduction credit under the Sustainable Sites category, which awards points for cool roof installation. For low-slope roofs (pitch ≤ 2:12), the membrane must meet a minimum aged SRI (three-year CRRC value) of 82 to qualify. White EPDM from Carlisle and Elevate, as installed by Membriko, achieves aged SRI values in the range 80 to 87 — products at the upper end of this range comfortably meet the LEED threshold. Membriko's documentation package for LEED projects includes the CRRC product rating sheet, the Declaration of Performance under EN 13956, and the installation quality control record — all documents required to support the credit submission.

### BREEAM International

BREEAM International awards credits under the Energy category for reductions in building energy demand and under Health and Wellbeing for improved internal thermal comfort. Cool roofing contributes to both. Membriko works with BREEAM assessors and project teams in Portugal to provide the technical evidence required for credit award, including quantified estimates of cooling energy reduction for the specific building configuration.

### Future Regulatory Trends

The direction of European and Portuguese energy regulation is unambiguous: minimum energy performance standards will tighten progressively through 2030, 2040, and 2050. Buildings undergoing significant renovation will be required to meet increasingly stringent energy performance levels. Cool roofing — particularly when combined with improved roof insulation, which Membriko can specify and coordinate — is a renovation measure that makes a quantifiable contribution to the energy performance improvement required by these forthcoming obligations. Installing white EPDM today positions a building for improved regulatory compliance through the next several decades.

## White EPDM vs the Alternatives

Several other products compete in the reflective roofing market. Membriko's assessment of each is based on technical performance data rather than commercial preference.

### White EPDM vs White TPO

Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) membranes are white by default — the polymer's natural colour is white, with the surface formulation providing UV protection. White TPO achieves initial solar reflectance of 0.75 to 0.83, broadly comparable to white EPDM. The seams are heat-welded rather than adhesive-bonded, producing a monolithic fusion joint that, when correctly made, is as strong as the parent membrane.

The substantive difference between white EPDM and white TPO is in the long-term performance evidence base. EPDM roofing membranes have been in continuous service since the 1960s and are supported by independent field studies examining membranes with 28 to 40 years of in-service exposure. TPO entered the roofing market in the 1990s; its oldest installations are in their late twenties. Published accelerated ageing studies show greater variability in TPO's long-term performance relative to EPDM, reflecting the more complex and less thermally stable polymer chemistry of TPO. For clients where a 40 to 50 year service life with a single installation is the priority, Membriko recommends white EPDM. Membriko specialises in EPDM and does not install TPO; where a project specification is genuinely open between the two, we explain this distinction and allow the client and their design team to decide.

### White EPDM vs White PVC

White PVC single-ply membranes have been installed on European flat roofs since the 1970s. Initial solar reflectance (0.70 to 0.80) is similar to white EPDM. The heat-welded seams are a technical advantage. The structural limitations of PVC are well documented: plasticisers migrate out of the membrane over time, causing progressive stiffening and embrittlement; the service temperature ceiling of approximately 60°C is regularly exceeded by surface temperatures on roofs in central and southern Portugal; and PVC contains chlorine that limits its recyclability and creates toxic combustion products in fire scenarios. Projected service life for white PVC in Portuguese solar exposure conditions is 25 to 30 years — substantially less than the 40 to 50 years documented for EPDM. The total cost of ownership over a 50-year building life, including one replacement of the PVC system, exceeds that of a single EPDM installation.

### White EPDM vs Reflective Coatings

Reflective coatings — white elastomeric or acrylic liquid-applied products — are sometimes proposed as a low-cost alternative to membrane replacement on existing dark roofs. The appeal is obvious: applying a white coating over an existing bitumen membrane appears to cost less than a full roof replacement.

The technical limitations are significant. A reflective coating does not replace the waterproofing function of the substrate membrane; it only adds reflectivity to whatever waterproofing already exists. If the existing membrane has open seams, cracks, or delamination from the substrate, the coating applied over it does not repair these failures. The service life of a reflective coating on a bituminous substrate is typically five to ten years — after which reapplication is required. And the aged reflectance of white coatings is lower than that of aged white EPDM, reducing the long-term energy benefit. Membriko recommends reflective coatings only where the existing waterproofing membrane is in sound condition and the client's objective is a temporary boost in reflectivity without full roof replacement. For any roof requiring waterproofing replacement — which is the condition of the majority of aged Portuguese roofing — white EPDM is the solution that addresses both the waterproofing need and the reflectivity objective in a single installation with a 40 to 50 year service life.

## Maintaining Reflectivity: Durability Over Time

Membriko's commitment to clients does not end at installation. Understanding how white EPDM's reflective performance changes over time — and what can be done to maintain it — is part of the professional service that Membriko provides.

### How Reflectance Declines and Stabilises

The reflectance decline in white EPDM follows a predictable curve: rapid initial reduction in the first two to three years as soiling accumulates and surface oxidation begins, followed by a plateau as the soiling load reaches a dynamic equilibrium between deposition and weather washing. The aged steady-state reflectance (0.65 to 0.72 solar reflectance; SRI 80 to 87) is the technically relevant value for energy performance calculations and regulatory compliance purposes.

Three mechanisms drive this initial decline:

**Particulate soiling.** Atmospheric particulates — dust, soot, pollen, organic debris — deposit on the membrane surface. Deposition rates vary significantly by location: urban industrial environments accumulate soiling faster than clean rural sites. In locations near intensive agricultural activity (a significant factor in the Alentejo and Ribatejo), organic aerosols and dusts can accelerate initial reflectance reduction.

**Biological colonisation.** Algae and biofilm can form on white EPDM surfaces that remain wet from rain and dew, particularly in environments with moderate humidity and moderate temperature — more relevant in northern Portugal and in shaded roof areas. Some white EPDM formulations incorporate biocide additives that limit biological growth; Membriko can specify these products where biological colonisation risk is elevated.

**Limited surface oxidation.** Unlike UV-vulnerable polymer systems, EPDM's chemically resistant backbone undergoes only minimal surface oxidation in UV exposure. A slight surface yellowing may be visible after several years but has a modest effect on reflectance.

### Long-Term SRI Projections

| Service Period | Estimated SRI | Basis |
|---------------|--------------|-------|
| At installation | 100 – 110 | Manufacturer catalogue values |
| 3 years aged | 80 – 87 | CRRC measured aged rating |
| 10 years (with annual cleaning) | 72 – 82 | Field data and model projection |
| 10 years (without cleaning) | 60 – 70 | Estimated; higher soiling environments |
| 20 years (maintained) | 65 – 75 | Estimated from available data |
| 30–50 years | 60 – 70 | Long-term projection; limited field data |

An SRI of 65 to 70 after 30 years of service still represents a very substantial thermal benefit relative to a dark roof with SRI below 10.

### Maintenance Protocol

Membriko recommends the following maintenance approach for white EPDM installations:

Annual cleaning with a medium-pressure water jet and neutral pH detergent, applied by hand brush or soft roller and rinsed thoroughly. This removes accumulated particulate soiling and partially restores reflectance towards the aged steady-state value. High-pressure jetting that could damage the membrane surface or seam edges is not recommended.

For roofs where biological growth is observed — green or grey discolouration indicating algae — a dilute biocide solution (sodium hypochlorite at 0.5% to 1% concentration, or benzalkonium chloride based products compatible with EPDM) can be applied by hand sprayer, left for 20 to 30 minutes, and rinsed off with clean water.

Annual inspection of the membrane's waterproofing integrity — seam condition, termination details, penetration flashings, perimeter edges — is included in Membriko's standard maintenance programme, which covers all installed roofs under the 20-year workmanship warranty.

## Application Cases

### Industrial and Logistics Buildings

Warehouses, distribution centres, and light industrial units are the category where cool roofing delivers maximum energy and financial impact. Single-storey structures with 100% of the upper envelope as roofing, mechanical handling operations that generate internal heat loads, and temperature-sensitive inventory that benefits from lower ambient temperature — all of these factors combine to make white EPDM the highest-return investment available in the building envelope.

Membriko has installed white EPDM on industrial and logistics buildings across Portugal, including in the Lisbon metropolitan area, the Alentejo, and the centre of the country. Projects typically involve large unobstructed roof areas (500 m² to over 10,000 m²) on metal deck structures, installed by the mechanically fastened method. In each case, Membriko provides the client with a pre-installation energy analysis estimating the annual cooling cost reduction, and a post-installation documentation package supporting the building's energy certification.

### Commercial and Retail Buildings

Supermarkets, hypermarkets, retail parks, and shopping centres have extensive flat roofs, high internal cooling demands from refrigeration and customer comfort systems, and building managers whose operational focus includes energy cost reduction. White EPDM from Membriko addresses the rooftop contribution to cooling load while simultaneously renewing the building's waterproofing system — typically in a single installation visit that minimises disruption to trading operations.

For retail clients with corporate sustainability commitments — a growing segment of the Portuguese market — Membriko's documentation supports both the energy saving quantification required for ESG reporting and the certification credit claims for LEED or BREEAM assessments.

### Office Buildings and Mixed-Use Developments

For office buildings with flat roofs — particularly lower-rise buildings of two to four storeys where the top-floor thermal environment is significantly affected by the roof — white EPDM improves occupant thermal comfort in the hot season and reduces the cooling load on rooftop HVAC units. In the growing Portuguese market for certified-sustainable office space, a documented cool roof installation with CRRC-rated reflectance values is a tangible component of the building's environmental credentials.

### Residential Buildings in the South

In the Algarve and Alentejo, detached villas and residential apartments with flat or very low-pitch roofs are common. Membriko installs white EPDM on residential buildings in these regions to the same technical standards applied to commercial projects — with a pre-installation assessment, a detailed proposal with energy savings estimates, and a 20-year workmanship warranty. For holiday villas where the property is occupied only in summer, a cool roof is particularly valuable: the building is occupied precisely when the roof overheating problem is greatest, and the improvement in interior temperature on arrival (before the air conditioning has been running for hours to cool the interior) is immediately apparent to occupants.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Does white EPDM get dirty and lose its reflectivity over time?**

Yes — all white outdoor surfaces accumulate soiling. White EPDM's solar reflectance declines from the initial value of 0.80 to 0.85 to a steady-state aged value of approximately 0.65 to 0.72 over the first two to five years of service. After this initial decline, the value stabilises at a level that still represents a very large reflectance advantage over any dark roofing surface. Annual cleaning with water and neutral detergent restores a meaningful proportion of the lost reflectance. The aged SRI (80 to 87 per CRRC methodology) is the value used for LEED compliance assessment and for realistic long-term energy saving calculations. Membriko bases all its financial projections on aged, not initial, reflectance values.

**Q2: Is white EPDM worthwhile in northern Portugal?**

It depends on the building. In the north, irradiance is lower and cooling degree days are fewer — so the annual cooling energy saving per square metre is lower than in the Algarve. For residential buildings in the northern interior that are heated throughout winter, a detailed energy balance analysis is needed before recommending white over black. For buildings with year-round cooling loads regardless of climate — cold storage, food retail, data centres — white EPDM is still the correct specification even in Porto. Membriko does not apply a one-size-fits-all answer to this question; the correct answer for each building is determined by calculation, and we provide that calculation as part of the proposal.

**Q3: Does white EPDM cost significantly more than black?**

The material cost premium is approximately €1 to €3 per square metre depending on thickness and manufacturer. Installation costs are identical. At typical Portuguese cooling energy prices and solar irradiance levels in the south and centre of the country, this premium is recovered in cooling energy savings within one to three years. The membrane's 40 to 50 year service life means that the payback period represents a very small fraction of the product's useful life. Membriko quantifies the expected payback for each project in the proposal documentation.

**Q4: Can I have my existing black EPDM painted white?**

It is technically possible to apply a reflective coating over existing black EPDM in good condition using an acrylic or polyurethane formulation specifically compatible with EPDM chemistry. This approach has a service life of five to ten years for the reflective function, after which reapplication is needed. It does not repair any waterproofing defects in the existing membrane. If the existing black EPDM is in sound condition with all seams intact and no evidence of delamination or water ingress, a reflective coating can be a cost-effective way to add temporary reflectivity without full membrane replacement. If the existing membrane has waterproofing issues — which is Membriko's finding on the majority of aged roofs we inspect — full replacement with white EPDM is the correct solution.

**Q5: Does white EPDM cause glare problems for neighbouring buildings or aircraft?**

White EPDM reflects light in a diffuse rather than specular manner. Unlike polished metal or glass, which create directed beam reflections, white EPDM scatters reflected light across a broad angular range, substantially reducing the intensity in any single direction. In practice, glare complaints from white EPDM roofing are rare. The surface has a matte appearance and does not create the mirror-like reflections associated with polished materials. For projects in specific geometrical configurations — rooftops immediately adjacent to glazed façades of neighbouring buildings at comparable height — Membriko can model the reflection geometry on request and confirm whether any directional glare issue is likely.

**Q6: What is the difference between white EPDM and a reflective coating?**

White EPDM is a complete waterproofing membrane that simultaneously waterproofs and reflects. It has a service life of 40 to 50 years for both functions. A reflective coating is a surface treatment that adds reflectivity to whatever waterproofing substrate it is applied to; it has no waterproofing function of its own, and its reflective performance service life is five to ten years. White EPDM is the right solution when a roof needs to be waterproofed (or re-waterproofed) and reflective performance is also a priority. A reflective coating may be considered as a short-term measure when the existing waterproofing is in genuinely good condition and the goal is a temporary reflectance improvement without the cost of full membrane replacement.

**Q7: Is white EPDM as durable as black EPDM?**

Yes — the fundamental durability of white EPDM is equivalent to black EPDM because they share the same polymer backbone: the saturated ethylene-propylene rubber network that gives EPDM its exceptional resistance to UV radiation, ozone, thermal cycling, and mechanical fatigue. The substitution of TiO₂ for carbon black as the primary filler does not compromise the material's structural performance. The major manufacturers — Carlisle (Sure-White) and Elevate (EcoWhite) — offer material warranties of 25 to 40 years on their 90-mil white products, and Membriko backs its white EPDM installations with the same 20-year workmanship warranty it applies to all EPDM work.

**Q8: How much can I save on air conditioning with a cool roof?**

For a single-storey commercial or industrial building in the Algarve or Alentejo, with mechanical cooling, a white EPDM roof will typically reduce cooling energy consumption by 20% to 30%. At current electricity prices in Portugal, this translates to annual savings of approximately €3.50 to €5.00 per square metre of roof area. For a 2,000 m² warehouse roof in Faro, annual savings of €7,000 to €10,000 are realistic, with a payback on the material cost premium in under three years. For a similar building in Lisbon, savings of €2.50 to €4.00/m²/year are more typical. For northern Portugal, €1.50 to €2.50/m²/year. Membriko calculates a specific estimate for each project based on the building dimensions, climate zone, building use, and existing HVAC system — and presents this calculation transparently in the proposal, so the investment decision is based on real numbers rather than industry generalisations.
