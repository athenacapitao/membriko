# Cool Reflective Roofs (Coberturas Reflectivas) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Cool roofs use highly reflective surfaces to reduce solar heat gain, lowering building cooling
costs and mitigating the urban heat island effect. White EPDM membranes combine the proven
durability and waterproofing performance of EPDM with a titanium dioxide (TiO₂) pigmented surface
that reflects up to 85% of incoming solar radiation.

In Portugal — particularly the Algarve, Alentejo and Greater Lisbon — summer roof surface
temperatures on conventional dark membranes can exceed 80°C. A white EPDM cool roof reduces this
to 35-45°C, cutting cooling energy demand by 20-30% and significantly improving occupant comfort
in buildings without air conditioning.

## Key Technical Data

### Solar Reflectance and Emittance
- **Initial solar reflectance**: 0.80-0.85 (80-85% of solar radiation reflected)
- **3-year aged solar reflectance**: 0.65-0.72 (after weathering and soiling)
- **Thermal emittance**: 0.85-0.90 (high — efficiently re-radiates absorbed heat)
- **Solar Reflectance Index (SRI)**: 100-110 initial; 80-87 aged
- **Surface temperature reduction**: 25-35°C compared to black EPDM under same conditions

### Products
- **Carlisle Sure-White EPDM**: 60-mil and 90-mil options. 25+ years of field data. SRI 87 aged.
  ASTM D4637 Type I compliant. Sheets up to 20 ft × 100 ft.
- **Elevate (Firestone) EcoWhite EPDM**: 90-mil platinum EPDM. Available in EMEA market.
  40-year material warranty option on 90-mil.

### Energy Savings
- Cooling energy reduction: 20-30% for single-storey commercial/industrial buildings
- Peak cooling load reduction: 10-15% for multi-storey buildings (top floor)
- Annual energy cost savings: €2-5/m² in Portuguese climate (depending on building type,
  insulation level and HVAC system)
- Payback period for white vs black EPDM premium: typically 3-7 years in Portuguese conditions

## Portuguese Climate Relevance

Portugal is one of the highest solar irradiance countries in Western Europe:
- **Algarve**: Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) ~1,900-2,100 kWh/m²/year
- **Alentejo**: GHI ~1,800-1,900 kWh/m²/year
- **Greater Lisbon**: GHI ~1,700-1,800 kWh/m²/year
- **Porto/Norte**: GHI ~1,400-1,600 kWh/m²/year

These irradiance levels are 50-100% higher than Germany or the UK, making cool roof technology
proportionally more beneficial. A cool roof in Faro delivers roughly twice the energy savings
of an identical installation in Hamburg.

### Cooling Degree Days
Portuguese cities have significantly higher cooling degree days than Northern European capitals:
- Faro: ~900 CDD (base 18°C)
- Lisbon: ~600 CDD
- Porto: ~200 CDD

The higher the CDD, the greater the return on cool roof investment.

## Regulatory Context

### EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)
The recast EPBD (2024) strengthens minimum energy performance requirements for buildings across
the EU. Cool roofs contribute directly to compliance by reducing cooling demand — particularly
relevant as Portugal's REH (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Habitação)
tightens energy class requirements for new construction and major renovation.

### Portuguese Energy Certification (SCE)
The Sistema de Certificação Energética includes roof thermal characteristics in the building
energy calculation. A cool roof with high SRI improves the cooling energy balance, potentially
upgrading the building's energy class by one or more letters — directly impacting property value.

### LEED and BREEAM Credits
- **LEED**: Sustainable Sites credit SS c7.2 — Heat Island Effect: Roof (SRI ≥ 78 for low-slope)
- **BREEAM**: Credits under Energy and Health & Wellbeing categories

## White vs Black EPDM: When to Choose Each

| Factor | White EPDM | Black EPDM |
|---|---|---|
| Cooling-dominated buildings | Preferred | — |
| Heating-dominated buildings | — | Preferred (absorbs solar heat) |
| Industrial/commercial (south Portugal) | Strongly preferred | — |
| Residential (north Portugal) | Consider heating balance | Often preferred |
| Green roof base | Not applicable (covered) | Standard |
| Below pavers/ballast | No benefit (not exposed) | Standard |
| Visible roofs (aesthetics) | Preferred | — |
| Under-tile application | No benefit | Standard |

## Urban Heat Island Mitigation

Research from US EPA and European studies shows that widespread cool roof adoption can reduce
urban ambient air temperature by 0.3-1.0°C. In Portuguese cities experiencing summer heat
waves (>40°C ambient), this represents a meaningful public health intervention.

Lisbon's municipal climate adaptation strategy identifies cool surfaces (roofs and pavements) as
a priority measure. Porto's climate action plan similarly targets roof albedo improvement.

## Research Gaps

- No Portuguese-specific field study measuring cool roof energy savings with metered data
- Limited data on soiling rates and reflectance degradation in Portuguese conditions (dust,
  pollen, pollution patterns differ from US data)
- No published analysis of the optimal cool roof adoption threshold for Portuguese cities
  (percentage of roof area needed for measurable urban cooling)
