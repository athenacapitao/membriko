# Cool Reflective Roofs — Page Structure

## Unique Layout: 14 Sections

This page emphasizes energy savings, the science of reflectivity, and the Portuguese summer
heat challenge. The visual language should be bright and clean — whites and sky blues — to
reinforce the cool roof concept.

### Section 1: Hero — "Reduza a Temperatura da Sua Cobertura em 30°C"
- **Visual**: Thermal image split — dark roof at 80°C vs white EPDM at 45°C
- **Stats**: 85% Reflectivity | -30°C Surface Temp | 30% Cooling Savings | 50+ Years

### Section 2: The Overheating Problem — Portuguese Roofs in Summer
- Summer roof temperatures in Portugal: 70-85°C on dark surfaces
- Energy cost of cooling: the roof as the biggest heat source
- Urban heat island effect in Lisbon, Porto, Faro

### Section 3: What Is a Cool Roof? — The Science of Reflectivity
- Solar reflectance, thermal emittance, SRI explained simply
- How white EPDM achieves 85% reflectance (TiO₂ pigmentation)
- Comparison with other surface colours and materials

### Section 4: Energy Savings — Real Numbers for Portugal
- 20-30% cooling cost reduction data
- Peak load reduction for HVAC systems
- Portuguese climate zones and savings variation
- Payback period calculations

### Section 5: Urban Heat Island Effect and Cool Roofs
- How dark roofs heat cities
- Cool roof contribution to urban cooling (0.3-1.0°C reduction)
- Lisbon and Porto climate adaptation strategies

### Section 6: Membriko's Cool Roof Installation Process
- Same proven EPDM installation methods (adhered, mechanical, ballasted)
- Additional considerations for reflective surface protection during install
- Quality assurance and SRI verification

### Section 7: White vs Black EPDM — Decision Guide
- When to choose white (cooling-dominated buildings)
- When to choose black (heating-dominated, covered applications)
- Portuguese regional guidance (Algarve = white; Serra = consider black)
- Hybrid approaches (white field, black flashings)

### Section 8: Cool Roofs in the Portuguese Climate
- Algarve/Alentejo: maximum benefit zone
- Greater Lisbon: strong benefit
- Porto/Norte: balanced analysis (heating vs cooling)
- Solar irradiance data by region

### Section 9: Technical Specifications
- White EPDM specific properties (reflectance, emittance, SRI)
- Mechanical properties (same as black EPDM)
- Product standards (ASTM D4637, EN 13956)

### Section 10: Energy Regulations and Cool Roofs
- EPBD requirements and cool roof contribution
- Portuguese REH and energy certification (SCE)
- LEED and BREEAM credits
- Future regulatory trends

### Section 11: EPDM Reflective vs Alternatives
- White EPDM vs white TPO vs white PVC vs reflective coatings
- Durability of reflectance over time (EPDM vs competitors)
- Total cost of ownership comparison

### Section 12: Reflectivity Maintenance and Durability
- How reflectance changes over time (initial vs 3-year aged)
- Cleaning and maintenance to restore reflectance
- Expected SRI values at 5, 10, 20 years

### Section 13: Application Cases
- Industrial/warehouse buildings (single-storey, maximum benefit)
- Commercial centres and supermarkets
- Office buildings
- Residential (Algarve villas, apartment blocks)

### Section 14: FAQ Section (8 Questions)
