# Terraces and Balconies (Terraços e Varandas) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

Terraces and balconies are, from a waterproofing engineering standpoint, the most failure-prone
horizontal surfaces in residential and commercial construction. Unlike non-accessible flat roofs,
they must simultaneously function as a waterproof barrier AND as a usable outdoor floor — a
combination of demands that eliminates many waterproofing systems from consideration entirely.

The EPDM membrane's position in a terrace or balcony assembly is beneath the finish layer. It is
completely hidden once the deck, tile, stone or composite boarding is installed. This invisibility
has a critical practical consequence: when the membrane fails, the failure manifests as ceiling
staining, structural concrete carbonation, or mould growth in the room below — not as visible
surface deterioration. The membrane must therefore be correct from day one, because inspection
after the fact is destructive and expensive.

Membriko's work on terraces and balconies is among the most technically demanding EPDM
application in the residential segment. The combination of pedestrian loading, drainage
management, thermal cycling, substrate cracking, and finish compatibility requires a level of
detail knowledge that generalist waterproofing contractors rarely possess.

## EPDM Under Pedestrian Loading

### Mechanical Behaviour Under Compressive Load

EPDM membranes used in accessible terrace and balcony applications are typically 1.5 mm or
2.0 mm thickness. The increased thickness (versus 1.2 mm flat-roof specification) is selected for
two reasons:

1. **Static puncture resistance** (EN 12730): At 2.0 mm, EPDM passes the EN 12730 static load
   test with a minimum 20 kg point load capacity. This ensures the membrane is not punctured by
   gravel pieces, aggregate in mortar bedding, or fallen sharp objects during construction.

2. **Dynamic puncture resistance** (EN 12691): Impact from dropped tools, spiked heel loads, and
   hail impact are simulated. 2.0 mm EPDM passes EN 12691 classification E50.

The membrane itself is never in direct contact with pedestrian traffic. It is always protected by:
- A geotextile protection fleece (minimum 300 g/m²)
- A drainage nodule sheet (dimple mat or drainage board)
- Bedding mortar layer (for ceramic and stone finishes)
- OR an adjustable pedestal system (for paver and deck finishes)

This separation is critical: EPDM's elongation capacity (300-400%) means it can accommodate
substrate cracking and movement, but it is not designed to absorb direct shoe heel impact without
a protection layer.

### Pedestal Systems (Sistemas de Apoio Regulável)

Pedestal systems — known commercially as "plots" or "plots reguláveis" — are a dominant terrace
finish method in Portugal, particularly in urban residential renovation. A pedestal system
consists of:

- Adjustable polypropylene or stainless steel screw-jack pedestals placed directly on the EPDM
  membrane (on a protection fleece layer)
- Large format porcelain tiles (60x60 cm, 80x80 cm, 60x120 cm) or natural stone slabs laid on
  the pedestals
- The membrane slopes to the drain; the finish surface is horizontal (levelled by pedestal height
  adjustment)

This system has several advantages for EPDM:
- The membrane is fully accessible by lifting individual pavers — no destructive work needed for
  inspection or repair
- No bedding mortar contacts the EPDM surface — the membrane can be inspected visually
- Thermal movement of the finish tiles is decoupled from the membrane — no point load on seams
- Drains can incorporate a two-level design: a primary drain at membrane level (protecting the
  structure) and a surface-level drain through the paver grid for routine rainfall management

Pedestal load distribution: a standard 600x600 mm paver resting on four pedestals at 300x300 mm
spacing creates a point load of approximately 0.8-1.5 kg/cm² under each pedestal foot, depending
on the paver and stone weight. The EPDM membrane beneath a protection fleece easily tolerates
this load without permanent deformation.

## Portuguese Terrace Culture: Outdoor Living Tradition

Portugal has one of Europe's most developed cultures of outdoor living space. This manifests in
built form in several specific ways relevant to waterproofing:

**Coberturas de uso misto:** Many Portuguese apartment buildings have roof terraces shared between
multiple units or used as communal amenity space. These surfaces receive regular pedestrian traffic,
hosts seasonal furniture, and in many cases support planters, pergolas, and BBQ structures. Each
additional structural element creates a penetration or a concentrated load point — each is a
potential waterproofing failure.

**Varandas envolventes:** Traditional Portuguese urban apartments commonly feature wrap-around
balconies (varandas corridas) on multiple elevations. These are typically 0.8-1.5 m wide,
cantilevered or supported by brackets, and exposed to prevailing wind and rain from at least
two directions. The floor-to-wall junction and the junction between the balcony slab and the
building facade are the two highest-risk infiltration points in this building type.

**Terraço sobre garagem:** A significant proportion of Portuguese detached houses from the
1970s-1990s have the garage as a single-storey element below the living area, with a terrace over
the garage roof. These are among the highest-volume renovation waterproofing projects Membriko
handles: the original bituminous waterproofing on these surfaces typically reaches end of life
between 15 and 25 years of service.

**Resort and tourism sector:** The Algarve, Costa de Lisboa, and Alentejo Litoral have extensive
resort, hotel, and villa stock where roof terraces are a premium amenity. These surfaces receive
heavy seasonal pedestrian traffic, pool drainage spillage, and cleaning with pressure washers and
chemical agents — all of which must be accommodated by the waterproofing system.

## Drainage Requirements and Slope Engineering

### RGEU Slope Requirements for Accessible Terraces

The Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas (RGEU, Decreto-Lei 38 382/51) specifies:

- **Article 90**: Minimum drainage slope of 1% for flat roofs ("terraços") of urban buildings.
  This applies to both accessible and non-accessible surfaces.
- Industry consensus (codified in LNEC technical guidance and reinforced by the DTU 43.1
  French reference widely used by Portuguese engineers) is that the design minimum should be 1.5%
  to account for construction tolerances. Membriko designs to 2% minimum at the substrate level
  to guarantee 1.5% minimum at the finish surface after allowing for bedding mortar thickness
  variation.

### Accessible Terrace Drainage: Two-Stage Approach

The correct drainage design for an accessible terrace with a finish layer above the membrane is
a two-stage system:

1. **Primary drainage** (at membrane level): Drains integrated into the EPDM system, located at
   low points of the sloped substrate. These drains handle any water that penetrates the finish
   layer — whether through joints, cracks, or during construction — and prevent hydrostatic
   pressure build-up against the membrane.

2. **Secondary drainage** (at finish surface level): Surface drains, channel drains, or open
   joints between pavers that remove the majority of rainfall before it reaches the membrane.
   This reduces the hydraulic load on the primary drainage system and the hydrostatic pressure
   on the membrane during intense rainfall events.

For pedestal paver systems, the surface drains naturally through the gaps between pavers (minimum
3-5 mm joint width recommended). For continuous ceramic and stone surfaces, linear drains or
point drains at the finish level are mandatory.

### Drain Types Compatible with EPDM

- **EPDM-bonded drain flange**: A pre-moulded EPDM drain ring is bonded to the membrane with
  EPDM adhesive tape, creating a watertight seal at the most critical point. This is the Membriko
  standard.
- **Cast-iron sumped drain**: Older building stock uses cast-iron grated drains. The EPDM membrane
  is wrapped over the drain flange and sealed with lead or bituminous tape at the interface. Less
  preferred — risk of interface failure between dissimilar materials.
- **Stainless steel drain with EPDM collar**: Modern EPDM-compatible drain systems include a
  stainless steel body with a factory-bonded EPDM collar. The collar is welded to the field
  membrane using standard EPDM adhesive tape — the most reliable system for new installations.

## Balcony-Specific Waterproofing Failures: Evidence and Analysis

Balcony waterproofing is the single most common residential waterproofing complaint category in
Portugal. The pattern of failure is predictable:

### Root Causes of Balcony Failure

1. **Inadequate original specification**: Many balconies built between 1960 and 1990 have no
   separate waterproofing membrane at all — a single layer of ceramic tile applied with cement
   adhesive to the concrete slab was considered sufficient. This approach fails when tile joints
   crack (typically within 5-15 years due to thermal movement) and water penetrates to the
   concrete below.

2. **Cracking at the slab-to-wall junction**: The junction between the balcony slab and the
   building facade is a structural discontinuity — different materials, different thermal
   coefficients, different movement patterns. Without a properly detailed waterproof upstand
   carried 150 mm up the wall, this junction is an open water pathway.

3. **Penetration failures**: Balcony drainage pipes, balustrade post fixings, and anchor bolts
   for overhead structures are all penetrations through the floor. Each one is a potential
   infiltration point if not sealed with a dedicated prefabricated EPDM accessory.

4. **Thermal movement causing tile detachment**: Large format tiles (common in post-2000
   construction) have very low tolerance for differential movement between tile and substrate.
   When the waterproofing layer beneath the tile is a rigid system (cementitious coating, liquid
   bitumen), it cannot accommodate the movement and delaminates, allowing water to track beneath
   the tile bed.

### Statistical Context

Insurance data from Portuguese housing associations (available through APFM — Associação
Portuguesa de Facilities Management) consistently identifies balcony and terrace water ingress
as the #1 claim category in residential buildings. Estimates from the Portuguese construction
pathology literature (LNEC ITE 44 — Fichas de Diagnóstico e de Intervenção) suggest that
approximately 65-70% of water infiltration claims in multi-family residential buildings involve
terraces and balconies as either the primary source or a contributing factor.

## Finish System Compatibility

### Cerâmica (Ceramic Tile and Porcelain)

- Industry standard: ceramic and porcelain tiles must NOT be bedded directly on the EPDM membrane.
  The alkaline environment of cement-based adhesive is not harmful to EPDM chemistry, but the
  rigid tile bed prevents the EPDM from performing its elastic function — absorbing substrate
  movement without cracking.
- Correct approach: EPDM + protection fleece + drainage nodule mat + cement screed + tile adhesive
  + tile. The drainage nodule mat (nódulo drenante) decouples the tile bed from the EPDM.
- Joint width: minimum 5 mm movement joints in the tile bed at all perimeters and at maximum
  3-metre intervals internally.

### Pedra Natural (Natural Stone: Limestone, Schist, Slate)

- Portuguese limestone (Lioz, Azul Valverde) and schist (xisto) are common terrace finishes
  in renovation projects, particularly in historic urban centres.
- Stone is inherently more porous than porcelain — water that enters through stone joints must
  be managed by the primary drainage layer, not relied upon to evaporate.
- Heavy stone slabs (50-80 mm thick limestones) on pedestal systems create point loads of
  2.0-3.5 kg/cm² — within EPDM's tolerance under a 300 g/m² protection fleece.

### Deck de Madeira (Timber and Composite Decking)

- IPE, cumaru, and thermally modified timber decks are installed on adjustable aluminium or
  stainless steel bearer systems fixed to the pedestal base plates.
- The bearer fixings must NOT penetrate the EPDM membrane. All bearing surfaces rest on the
  membrane through protection pads; no mechanical fixings through the membrane surface are
  permitted in the deck field.
- Composite (WPC — Wood-Plastic Composite) decking is increasingly specified over EPDM for
  residential balconies due to lower maintenance requirements versus natural timber.
- Drainage: the open joints between deck boards (minimum 5 mm) allow rainfall to drain to the
  EPDM surface. The membrane slope directs water to the drain.

### Lajeta de Betão (Concrete Pavers)

- Precast concrete pavers on pedestals or on sand bed are the most economical accessible finish
  compatible with EPDM.
- Weight: standard 60x60x4 cm concrete pavers weigh approximately 34 kg/m² — modest structural
  addition.
- Limitation: sand-bed installation over EPDM is not recommended — the sand migrates through
  the joints and can block drains. Only pedestal or adhesive-set approaches are used.

## Thermal and Acoustic Performance

### Thermal Bridging at Balcony Slab

Cantilevered balcony slabs are a significant source of thermal bridging in Portuguese buildings.
The concrete slab penetrating the building envelope creates a direct thermal bridge between the
interior and exterior. While waterproofing alone cannot resolve this structural thermal bridge, a
correctly designed warm-terrace assembly (insulation above the structural slab, below the EPDM)
can significantly reduce heat loss:

- 60 mm XPS insulation (lambda = 0.033 W/m·K) under EPDM achieves a terrace U-value of
  approximately 0.50 W/m²K — versus 3.0-5.0 W/m²K for an uninsulated concrete slab.
- EN ISO 10211 thermal bridge calculations should be performed for balconies with insulated
  terrace assemblies to verify junction details.

### Acoustic Insulation Under Terrace Finish

In multi-storey buildings, the terrace slab is also a sound transmission element. Footfall noise
from the terrace above is a common complaint in Portuguese apartment buildings. A compressible
acoustic underlay layer (typically 20-40 mm mineral wool or elastic foam boards) installed
between the EPDM membrane and the finish layer can achieve:

- Footfall sound reduction: ΔLw = 15-22 dB depending on material
- Combined waterproofing and acoustic function in a single assembly
- Compliance with RRAE (Regulamento dos Requisitos Acústicos dos Edifícios, DL 129/2002 as
  amended) targets for multi-family residential: Lnw ≤ 60 dB for impact noise.

## RGEU and Related Portuguese Regulations for Terraces

### RGEU (Decreto-Lei 38 382/51)

- **Article 66**: Balconies, terraces and exterior staircases must be constructed with non-slip
  surfaces.
- **Article 90**: Minimum 1% slope for drainage of flat roof surfaces.
- **Article 90 (upstand)**: While RGEU does not specify a minimum upstand height explicitly for
  terraces, LNEC ITE 44 (Fichas de Diagnóstico) and industry practice require a minimum
  150 mm upstand at all perimeters, raised to 200 mm in high-rainfall zones.

### LNEC ITE 44 — Fichas de Diagnóstico e de Intervenção

LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) ITE 44 documents are the primary national
reference for waterproofing failure diagnosis and remediation in Portugal. For terraces and
balconies, the key guidance documents specify:

- Minimum membrane elongation requirements to accommodate substrate cracking
- Drain installation details at the membrane level
- Upstand height and securement requirements at all wall and parapet junctions
- Protection layer requirements above the membrane before finish installation

These documents have the status of technical guidance rather than regulation, but are routinely
cited by structural and civil engineers in specifications and dispute resolution.

### Acessibilidade (DL 163/2006 — Regime de Acessibilidade)

Where a terrace or balcony is on a building subject to accessibility requirements (public
buildings, commercial premises, multi-family residential buildings with lifts), the finish surface
must meet:

- Maximum 2% cross-slope (to allow wheelchair and mobility aid navigation)
- Slip resistance: minimum wet slip resistance classification R11 (DIN 51130) or equivalent for
  outdoor hard surfaces
- No discontinuities (steps, lips) greater than 20 mm at transitions between surfaces

The pedestal system is particularly well-suited to accessibility requirements: the horizontal
finish surface is independent of the membrane slope, allowing both adequate drainage and a fully
level accessible surface.

## EPDM vs Alternative Systems for Accessible Terraces

### Betuminosa Modificada (APP/SBS Modified Bitumen)

The dominant historical solution for Portuguese terraces. Typical performance:

- Service life: 10-20 years (typically 12-15 years in south Portugal climate)
- Failure mode: surface oxidation and cracking at singular points (corners, drains, upstands)
- Pedestrian use: requires rigid protection screed; torch installation creates fire risk in
  occupied buildings
- Renovation: torch installation on existing membrane creates secondary fire risk; typically
  requires full removal

### Poliureia Pulverizada (Spray Polyurea)

Increasingly marketed in Portugal for terrace waterproofing. Performance characteristics:

- Service life: 10-20 years; requires re-coating at 10-year intervals
- Application: solvent-free, fast-curing spray — attractive for occupied buildings
- Weakness: adhesion failure to concrete if substrate preparation is inadequate; not fully
  elastic under cracked substrates over time; colour degradation under UV
- Cost: typically 30-50% more expensive per m² than EPDM for equivalent coverage
- Pedestrian use: adequate when correctly applied; re-coating requires complete surface preparation

### PVC Plastificado (Plasticised PVC)

- Service life: 20-25 years
- Heat-welded seams — torch or hot-air gun required
- Plasticiser migration causes brittleness after 15-20 years, particularly in high-UV environments
- Not compatible with bitumen-based substrates (requires full separation layer)
- Recyclability: chlorine content makes end-of-life recycling complex

### EPDM (Membriko Standard)

- Service life: 50+ years (field-proven; ERA study, SKZ study)
- Cold installation — no torch, no flame risk in occupied buildings
- Seams by adhesive tape — tested to peel and shear strength requirements
- No plasticiser migration — inherently inert polymer structure
- Fully elastic under substrate cracking — 300-400% elongation capacity
- Accessible: repairs by cold-bonded patch without surface preparation beyond cleaning

## Research Notes

**Pedestal system load distribution data** is derived from manufacturer testing data (Buzon
UK PT series, Eterno Ivica, Schlüter Systems) — no peer-reviewed academic study specific to
EPDM pedestal compatibility has been published as of February 2026.

**Portuguese balcony failure statistics** are derived from LNEC ITE 44, APFM reporting, and
construction pathology survey data. The 65-70% figure for balcony/terrace contribution to water
infiltration claims is consistent across multiple Portuguese sources but has not been peer-reviewed
in an international journal.

**RGEU upstand height**: The 150 mm minimum is industry consensus derived from LNEC ITE 44 and
DTU 43.1 (France). RGEU itself does not specify this figure explicitly — cite as best-practice
recommendation consistent with regulatory intent.
