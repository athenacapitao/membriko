# Terraces and Balconies — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Terraces and balconies occupy a distinct position in the Membriko content hierarchy. Unlike flat
roofs (which target engineers, specifiers, and commercial building owners), this page targets two
overlapping audiences simultaneously: residential homeowners dealing with a chronic infiltration
problem in the room below their balcony, and property developers or architects specifying a
finish system for a new residential or hospitality terrace.

The emotional stakes are immediate and domestic. A damp ceiling below a leaking balcony is not an
abstract engineering problem — it is a daily irritation, a source of family conflict, and a threat
to the property's resale value. The page must meet the reader where they are: frustrated,
possibly having already had repairs done that failed, and uncertain whether the problem can ever
be truly solved.

The secondary audience (developers and architects) needs technical credibility quickly. They are
evaluating EPDM against polyurea spray, PVC, and modified bitumen. They need finish-system
compatibility data, slope and drainage specifications, and regulatory compliance information.

The section architecture resolves this dual audience challenge by opening with the emotional
problem (infiltration below the terrace) before moving into technical depth, then surfacing
practical finish-system guidance that both audiences find directly useful.

Persuasion arc:
1. Cultural hook — Portuguese outdoor living as a value worth protecting
2. Problem — why terraces fail (emotional, visual)
3. EPDM solution — material argument
4. Finish compatibility — practical decision-making content
5. Drainage and slope — technical credibility
6. Installation process — de-risk the purchase
7. Balcony-specific challenges — sub-audience relevance
8. Renovation context — highest-volume commercial scenario
9. Thermal and acoustic benefits — value-add arguments
10. Technical specifications — specifier-level data
11. System comparison — handle alternatives objection
12. Maintenance — long-term ownership argument
13. Portuguese regulations — compliance confidence
14. FAQ — long-tail search capture
15. CTA — conversion

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Establish the terrace as a Portuguese lifestyle asset under threat.

**Content:**
- Headline: "O Terraço que Resiste — Impermeabilização EPDM para Espaços Exteriores"
  (English variant: "A Terrace That Lasts — EPDM Waterproofing for Outdoor Living Spaces")
- Sub-headline: The space people use to live outdoors in Portugal — for meals, gatherings, plants,
  and morning coffee — rests on a waterproofed slab. EPDM is what makes that slab last 50 years.
- Four stat blocks: 50+ anos vida útil / Compatível com 4 sistemas de acabamento / 20-year
  Membriko warranty / instalação a frio — sem maçarico
- CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico Gratuito" (primary) + "Ver Especificações Técnicas" (anchor, secondary)
- Background: Photograph of a premium terrace — large format stone or porcelain pavers, outdoor
  furniture, Mediterranean planting in pots, city or landscape view in background.

**Design note:** The visual should communicate aspiration, not construction. The waterproofing
is invisible — the lifestyle result is what's shown. The stats anchor the technical reality beneath
the image.

---

## Section 2: Portuguese Outdoor Living — The Stakes

**Purpose:** Emotional hook. Establish that the terrace is culturally significant, not just a
building element. Create urgency around protecting it properly.

**Content:**
- Short editorial passage on Portuguese terrace and balcony culture: the role of outdoor space
  in daily domestic life, from the Algarve rooftop terrace to the Porto varanda, the Lisbon miradouro
  apartment to the Alentejo quinta courtyard.
- The argument: this space represents thousands of euros of value — furniture, landscaping,
  aesthetic investment. The waterproofing beneath it is the single component that determines
  whether the whole investment survives.
- Transition: the majority of balcony and terrace waterproofing in existing Portuguese stock is
  either non-existent (older buildings) or past its design life. The cost of doing this wrong
  is not just the repair — it is the damage to the room below.

**Design note:** Editorial tone — not technical. Photograph or illustration of a family terrace
in a recognisable Portuguese urban setting.

## Section 3: Why Terraces and Balconies Fail

**Purpose:** Diagnose the problem with specificity. Show we understand the failure mechanisms —
including failures the reader may have already experienced.

**Content:** Four failure mechanisms, each with a brief technical explanation:

1. **Inadequate original waterproofing** — Many buildings from 1960-1990 have only ceramic tile
   over the concrete slab with no separate membrane. Tile joints crack within 5-20 years from
   thermal movement, opening water pathways to the structure.

2. **Failed slab-to-wall junction** — The joint between the balcony slab and the building facade
   is a structural discontinuity. Without a properly detailed upstand carried at least 150 mm up
   the wall, this junction is open to water.

3. **Penetration failures** — Balustrade post fixings, drainage pipe penetrations, overhead
   structure anchors: each one is a hole through the floor. Without purpose-made EPDM boots and
   collars, these are guaranteed infiltration points over time.

4. **Thermal movement cracking** — Portugal's terrace surfaces cycle from 0°C winter nights to
   80°C summer surface temperatures. A 6 m terrace moves 10-12 mm over this range. Rigid systems
   (cementitious coatings, SBS bitumen) crack at seams, corners, and singular points within a
   few thermal cycles.

**Design note:** Before/after photo pair — damaged ceiling below a leaking terrace (the
consequence) and a completed EPDM installation (the solution).

## Section 4: Why EPDM — The Material Case

**Purpose:** Technical credibility on EPDM's specific suitability for accessible terrace conditions.

**Content:**
- Lead with what makes EPDM different for accessible surfaces vs. non-accessible:
  greater thickness (1.5-2.0 mm), higher static and dynamic puncture resistance, ability to
  accommodate substrate cracking without failure
- Key material properties: 300-400% elongation, -45°C to +150°C service temperature, < 1%
  water absorption, EN 13956 compliance
- Specific performance advantage: EPDM at 2.0 mm thickness passes EN 12730 static puncture
  (≥ 20 kg) and EN 12691 dynamic puncture (class E50) — the tests that define whether a membrane
  can survive beneath a pedestrian finish layer
- The EPDM "basin" concept: the membrane is installed as a continuous tray — rising up every wall,
  wrapped around every drain, sealed at every penetration — creating a watertight container that
  holds water even if surface drains block completely

**Design note:** Cross-section diagram showing the terrace assembly layers from slab upwards:
substrate / insulation / EPDM / protection fleece / drainage layer / finish system.

## Section 5: Finish System Compatibility

**Purpose:** Practical decision-making content. Help the reader choose the right finish while
reinforcing EPDM's compatibility advantage. This is the page's most unique content — no
competitor explains this in Portugal.

**Content:** Four finish systems, each as a card with: description, installation method above
EPDM, pros, one consideration:

1. **Cerâmica e Porcelana (Ceramic and Porcelain Tile)**
   - Method: protection fleece + drainage nodule mat + mortar bed + tile adhesive
   - Pros: waterproof finish surface, wide format options (up to 120x60 cm), full colour range
   - Consideration: large format tiles over 60 cm require verified structural support

2. **Pedra Natural (Natural Stone)**
   - Method: pedestal system or mortar bed with drainage mat; stone sealed to reduce absorption
   - Pros: premium Portuguese materials (Lioz, Azul Valverde) available locally; durable
   - Consideration: porous stones require surface sealing; heavy slabs need structural check

3. **Deck de Madeira e Compósito (Timber and Composite Decking)**
   - Method: pedestal + aluminium or stainless bearer + deck boards (5 mm open joint minimum)
   - Pros: warm aesthetic; accessible membrane below (remove boards for inspection); low weight
   - Consideration: natural timber requires annual oiling; composite is lower maintenance

4. **Lajetas de Betão em Apoios Reguláveis (Concrete Pavers on Pedestals)**
   - Method: adjustable polypropylene pedestals + precast concrete or large-format porcelain paver
   - Pros: most cost-effective accessible finish; fully accessible membrane; accessible drainage
   - Consideration: minimum 3 mm joint between pavers for drainage

**Design note:** Four illustrated assembly cross-sections, one per finish type. Simple diagrams.

## Section 6: Drainage and Slope — Getting the Water Out

**Purpose:** Technical credibility on the most under-specified aspect of terrace waterproofing.

**Content:**
- Slope requirements: RGEU minimum 1%, Membriko design minimum 2% at substrate level
- Two-stage drainage explained: primary drain at membrane level (captures water through finish
  system), secondary drain at surface level (captures direct rainfall)
- Drain types: EPDM-bonded drain flanges; stainless steel with factory-bonded EPDM collar
- Pedestal system advantage: horizontal finish surface + sloped membrane below — accessibility
  and drainage solved simultaneously
- Critical detail: drain sumps — a recessed area around each drain ensures positive slope to
  the drain mouth; no flat zones where water can accumulate
- Upstand heights: minimum 150 mm at all perimeters; 200 mm recommended in Atlantic exposure
  zones (Porto, Setúbal, Aveiro); 250 mm where the terrace can flood from adjacent areas

**Design note:** Plan-view drainage diagram showing slope arrows and drain positions for a
typical rectangular terrace with two internal drains.

## Section 7: Installation Process — Six Steps

**Purpose:** Reduce purchase anxiety. Make the process feel professionally managed.

**Content:** Six-step process timeline:

1. **Diagnóstico e Levantamento** — Technical site visit, photographs, slope measurement, drain
   condition, existing membrane assessment, structural condition of slab. Written report delivered.

2. **Projeto de Impermeabilização** — Membrane specification, finish system selection, drain design,
   slope correction plan, upstand heights, penetration details. Submitted to client for approval.

3. **Demolição Seletiva e Preparação** — Removal of existing finish and membrane if required;
   repair of concrete cracks and defects; slope correction screeds; priming of substrate.

4. **Instalação da Membrana EPDM** — Membrane placement, bonding, and seaming; prefabricated
   corners and upstand details; EPDM drain flanges; pipe and fixing penetration boots; seam
   inspection.

5. **Teste de Estanquidade** — Flood test (minimum 24-hour water retention at full drain blockage)
   or electronic leak detection. Photographic record. No finish installation begins until test
   is passed.

6. **Revestimento e Entrega** — Installation of finish system; final visual inspection; delivery
   of as-built documentation; 20-year installation warranty certificate.

**Design note:** Horizontal stepper or numbered vertical timeline. Icon per step.

## Section 8: Balcony-Specific Challenges

**Purpose:** Speak directly to the apartment owner with a leaking balcony — the highest-volume
residential client segment.

**Content:**
- Balconies vs. terraces: structurally different (cantilevered vs. slab-on-wall), but identical
  waterproofing principles apply
- The junction problem: the slab-to-facade interface is the most common balcony failure point;
  how Membriko details this with a continuous EPDM upstand bonded to the wall substrate, topped
  with a stainless steel termination bar mechanically fixed and sealed
- Width constraint: balconies under 1.5 m wide have limited drainage slope options; Membriko
  details cross-slope to a linear drain at the outer edge when longitudinal slope is impossible
- Balustrade fixings: through-floor post fixings are treated with EPDM pipe boots or oversized
  EPDM sleeves, sealed from above with compatible sealant; no exposed mastic
- Occupied-building installation: EPDM cold installation means no torch flames, no petroleum
  solvent smell, no risk of fire — essential when working on apartment balconies with residents
  in the building

**Design note:** Detail diagram of the slab-to-wall junction with EPDM upstand and termination
bar. Photograph of balcony during installation.

## Section 9: Renovation — EPDM Over Existing Systems

**Purpose:** The highest-volume conversion scenario: the client has a failed terrace and wants
to know if they need to demolish everything.

**Content:**
- The renovation question: can EPDM go over existing waterproofing?
  Answer: in many cases, yes — with conditions
- Over existing bituminous membrane: EPDM can be applied over stable, non-blistered APP/SBS
  bitumen after grinding and priming. Blistered or delaminated membrane must be removed first.
- Over ceramic tile: tiles can remain as a substrate if they are all fully bonded (no hollow
  tiles), joints are filled and level, and the surface is primed. This eliminates the cost of
  demolition and disposal.
- Over existing EPDM: a new EPDM membrane can be bonded directly over old EPDM using EPDM primer
  and adhesive — a unique advantage not shared by PVC or polyurea systems.
- Financial argument: eliminating demolition and disposal can save 15-25% of total project cost.
  On a 40 m² terrace, this typically represents €800-2,000 in savings.
- Speed argument: renovation without demolition reduces the project programme by 2-4 days and
  eliminates structural noise and dust — critical for occupied apartments.

**Design note:** Side-by-side diagram showing full-demolition vs. over-installation assembly
stacks. Cost comparison callout box (illustrative indices, not absolute prices).

## Section 10: Thermal and Acoustic Benefits

**Purpose:** Value-add argument. The waterproofing decision can also deliver energy and comfort
improvements — if specified correctly.

**Content:**
- Thermal insulation: warm-terrace assembly with 60 mm XPS below EPDM achieves U-value of
  approximately 0.50 W/m²K vs. 3.0-5.0 W/m²K for an uninsulated concrete slab. Relevant for
  RCCTE compliance and reducing heating bills in the room below.
- Acoustic insulation: compressible mineral wool or acoustic foam underlay installed between
  protection fleece and finish layer achieves ΔLw 15-22 dB reduction in footfall noise. Addresses
  one of the most frequent complaints in Portuguese apartment buildings. RRAE (DL 129/2002)
  compliance: Lnw ≤ 60 dB for impact noise in multi-family residential.
- Combined assembly: a single project can add waterproofing + thermal insulation + acoustic
  insulation in one mobilisation — far more cost-effective than treating each separately.

**Design note:** Assembly diagram showing the three functional layers (waterproofing + thermal +
acoustic) in a single cross-section. Stat callouts: "U-value reduced from 3.5 to 0.5 W/m²K" /
"Footfall noise reduced by up to 22 dB".

## Section 12: EPDM vs Alternative Systems

**Purpose:** Handle the alternatives objection with an honest, data-led comparison.

**Content:** Comparison table — five systems, six evaluation criteria:

| Critério | EPDM | Betuminosa APP | Poliureia | PVC | Revestimento Líquido PU |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vida útil | 50+ anos | 10-15 anos | 10-20 anos | 20-25 anos | 10-15 anos |
| Elasticidade | 300-400% | 30-50% | 100-200% | 150-250% | 80-150% |
| Instalação a frio | Sim | Não (maçarico) | Sim (spray) | Não (quente) | Sim |
| Compatível sobre existente | Sim (condições) | Não recomendado | Sim (prep.) | Não | Sim |
| Reciclabilidade | 100% | Difícil | Não | Complexo (cloro) | Não |
| Custo 30 anos (índice) | 100 | 185 | 140 | 130 | 160 |

Below table: short honest paragraph acknowledging polyurea's speed advantage on complex shapes
and PVC's established track record for commercial installations. Credibility is maintained
by avoiding absolutist claims.

**Design note:** Table with EPDM column highlighted. Footnote indicating indices are illustrative.

## Section 13: Maintenance — 50 Years with Minimal Intervention

**Purpose:** Counter the "rubber roof won't last" objection with a positive long-term ownership
argument.

**Content:**
- What EPDM requires: annual visual inspection (5-minute walk-around), drain clearing twice per
  year, cleaning with pH-neutral cleaner
- What EPDM does NOT require: re-coating, re-sealing seams, re-treating with waterproofing paint,
  surface protection every 5-10 years (unlike polyurea, liquid PU, and SBS bitumen)
- Repair simplicity: EPDM punctures and minor tears are repaired by cold-bonded EPDM patch (same
  day, no specialist equipment, no surface preparation beyond cleaning). Repair is chemically
  bonded to the base membrane — not a cosmetic patch.
- The Membriko maintenance programme: annual inspection offer included with every installation;
  documented maintenance log; 20-year installation warranty.

**Design note:** Timeline graphic showing EPDM maintenance events vs. SBS bitumen maintenance
events over 30 years. Visual should make the low EPDM maintenance requirement obvious at a glance.

---

## Section 14: Portuguese Regulations

**Purpose:** Eliminate compliance doubt for specifiers and architects. Demonstrate Membriko's
regulatory fluency.

**Content:**
- RGEU (DL 38 382/51): Article 90 — minimum 1% drainage slope. Article 66 — non-slip finish
  surfaces required. Membriko designs to 2% slope minimum and specifies R11-rated finish surfaces.
- DL 163/2006 (Acessibilidade): accessible terraces require maximum 2% cross-slope on finish
  surface, no discontinuities > 20 mm, adequate slip resistance. Pedestal systems comply.
- RRAE (DL 129/2002 as amended): Lnw ≤ 60 dB impact noise limit for multi-family residential;
  compressible acoustic underlay assembly achieves compliance.
- RCCTE / REH (DL 118/2013): U-value targets for terrace slabs over heated spaces. Warm-terrace
  assembly with XPS achieves compliance.
- EN 13956 (NP EN 13956): EPDM product standard. CE marking mandatory. All Membriko membranes
  are CE-marked and compliant.
- LNEC ITE 44: Fichas de Diagnóstico — the primary national technical reference for diagnosis
  and specification of waterproofing interventions on terraces and balconies.

**Design note:** Regulatory badge grid (RGEU, EN 13956, CE, LNEC, DL 163/2006). Compact layout.

## FAQ Section (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search queries and reduce pre-sales questions. Questions must be
unique to terraces and balconies — no overlap with flat-roofs FAQ.

1. **Posso colocar cerâmica diretamente sobre o EPDM? / Can ceramic tile be laid directly on EPDM?**
   No — ceramic must be installed on a drainage nodule mat and mortar bed over a protection
   fleece. Direct contact between cement adhesive and EPDM restricts the membrane's elastic
   function and risks adherence problems.

2. **Qual é o declive mínimo num terraço com EPDM? / What is the minimum slope on an EPDM terrace?**
   RGEU requires 1% minimum; Membriko designs to 2% at substrate level to ensure 1.5% minimum
   at finish level after mortar bed thickness variation. For pedestal systems, the membrane slopes
   at 2% while the finish surface is horizontal.

3. **O EPDM aguenta os apoios dos sistemas de pedestal? / Does EPDM withstand pedestal system loads?**
   Yes. Pedestal foot loads on EPDM (typically 0.8-1.5 kg/cm²) are well within the membrane's
   static puncture resistance of 20 kg at 2.0 mm thickness. A 300 g/m² protection fleece is
   installed between the membrane and the pedestal base plates as standard.

4. **Posso instalar EPDM num terraço com o edifício habitado? / Can EPDM be installed on a terrace in an occupied building?**
   Yes — EPDM installation requires no open flame (no torch), no petroleum solvents at application,
   and no strong odours. Cold-bonded installation is the standard Membriko method, and it is
   explicitly chosen for occupied residential buildings.

5. **O que acontece se o ralo entupir depois de instalar o EPDM? / What happens if the drain blocks after EPDM installation?**
   The EPDM installation is detailed as a watertight basin with minimum 150 mm upstand at all
   perimeters. If the drain blocks and water accumulates, it is contained by the EPDM basin and
   does not penetrate the slab. The drain should be cleared — the structure below is protected.

6. **Posso pôr vasos pesados e mobiliário de exterior sobre o EPDM / Can I place heavy planters and outdoor furniture on EPDM?**
   Planters and furniture rest on the finish layer (tile, deck, paver), not directly on the
   EPDM. Provided the finish and supporting structure can carry the load, EPDM is unaffected.
   For very heavy planters (> 500 kg) in direct contact with EPDM (on a bare membrane), rubber
   pad protection is recommended.

7. **Qual é a diferença entre impermeabilizar uma varanda e um terraço? / What is the difference between waterproofing a balcony and a terrace?**
   The materials and principles are identical. The main technical difference is size and structural
   context: balconies are typically cantilevered slabs with limited width and more critical
   wind exposure; terraces are typically larger slabs with structural walls on more sides.
   The slab-to-facade junction detail is more critical on balconies due to the cantilever movement.

8. **Com que frequência devo inspecionar um terraço com EPDM? / How often should I inspect an EPDM terrace?**
   Membriko recommends a 5-minute visual inspection twice per year (spring and autumn), plus
   drain clearing before the wet season. A formal technical inspection every 5 years is included
   in the Membriko maintenance programme. EPDM requires no routine treatment — just clear drains
   and remove standing debris.
