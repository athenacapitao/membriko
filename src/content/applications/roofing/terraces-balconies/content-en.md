# Terrace and Balcony Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## The Outdoor Space Worth Protecting Properly

Walk through any Portuguese city — Lisbon, Porto, Évora, Faro — and you will notice something about how people use buildings. The terrace is not decorative. It is a room without a roof. Lunch happens there. Evenings happen there. The citrus tree in the corner pot, the folding table with four chairs, the washing line stretched between two walls: these are not afterthoughts. Outdoor living space is central to the Portuguese domestic life.

The flat surface beneath that life — the waterproofed slab that separates the terrace from the room below — is the single most failure-prone element in residential construction in Portugal. Balconies and terraces account for a disproportionate share of water infiltration claims in multi-family residential buildings. The pattern is always the same: a stain appears on the ceiling below. Repairs are made to the floor tiles above. The stain returns. The underlying waterproofing was never addressed.

Membriko, based in Pombal and operating across Portugal, was built around a single conviction: EPDM rubber membrane is the correct solution for this problem. Not because it is fashionable. Because its chemistry, its elastic behaviour, its mechanical durability, and its 50-year service life make it the only system that resolves terrace and balcony waterproofing definitively rather than repeatedly.

This page covers what every building owner, property developer, and architect needs to know about EPDM for terraces and balconies: why existing systems fail, what makes EPDM perform across decades of Portuguese climate, how it works under every common finish system, and how Membriko delivers each installation with the rigour the work demands.

## Why Terraces and Balconies Fail: The Engineering Reality

Understanding the failure mechanisms is not optional background — it is the foundation for understanding why material selection and installation quality are non-negotiable. Membriko's technical team encounters the same failure patterns in diagnosis after diagnosis across every region of Portugal.

### No Separate Waterproofing Membrane

A large proportion of Portuguese residential buildings constructed between 1960 and 1990 have no independent waterproofing membrane on balcony and terrace floors. Ceramic tile bedded in cement adhesive directly onto the concrete slab was considered adequate at the time of construction. It is not. Tile joints crack within five to twenty years under the thermal movement of Portuguese climate. Once the joints crack, water has a direct path to the structural concrete below and, from there, to the ceiling of the room beneath.

### The Slab-to-Facade Junction

The junction between the cantilevered balcony slab and the building facade is a structural discontinuity. The two elements have different materials, different thermal expansion coefficients, and different movement patterns over their service life. Without a correctly detailed waterproof upstand carried a minimum of 150 mm up the wall — sealed against both the wall and the slab with a flexible, elastic membrane — this junction is permanently open to water infiltration. No mastic, no rigid coating, and no tile grout can accommodate this movement reliably over decades.

### Penetration Failures

Balustrade post fixings, drainage pipework, overhead canopy anchors, and maintenance fixing points are all penetrations through the floor surface. Each one is a potential infiltration point. Mastic sealants — the default remedy in most building contracts — dry and crack within three to eight years, particularly in the temperature cycling conditions of Portuguese outdoor surfaces. Membriko treats every penetration with a purpose-made EPDM boot or collar, bonded to the field membrane with EPDM adhesive tape. There is no exposed mastic on any new Membriko installation.

### Thermal Movement Cracking

Portugal's terrace and balcony surfaces experience a temperature range from near zero on winter nights in the interior to 80°C surface temperature on summer afternoons in the Alentejo and Algarve. A six-metre terrace moves approximately 10-12 mm linearly across this range. Rigid and semi-rigid systems — cementitious waterproof coatings, modified bitumen membranes at the limit of their elastic capacity — crack at their weakest points: corners, drain interfaces, upstand junctions. These are precisely the points under the highest mechanical stress from movement. They are also the points from which water infiltration begins.

---

## Why EPDM — The Material Case

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a vulcanised synthetic rubber membrane manufactured under factory-controlled conditions to consistent thickness and mechanical properties. It is not a coating, not a liquid-applied system, and not a system whose performance depends on application thickness accuracy. It is a purpose-engineered membrane that creates a continuous waterproof basin beneath the terrace finish layer.

### The Chemistry Behind the Longevity

The molecular backbone of the EPDM polymer chain is a saturated carbon-to-carbon structure. This is the key characteristic: carbon-carbon bonds in the main chain are chemically inert to UV radiation and atmospheric ozone. They do not undergo the chain scission that degrades other polymers over time. Unlike SBS and APP modified bitumen, where unsaturated double bonds in the main chain are precisely where UV and ozone attack, EPDM's degradation resistance is intrinsic to its molecular structure — not a surface treatment or coating effect.

Carbon black, incorporated into the formulation at 25-35 parts per hundred polymer, reinforces the matrix against mechanical stress and converts UV photon energy to heat rather than allowing photon-induced bond breaking. This combination — inert main chain plus carbon black reinforcement — is why field studies of EPDM roofs after 28-32 years of service show elongation and tensile strength values still exceeding the normative minimums for new material.

Membriko specifies only CE-marked EPDM membranes compliant with EN 13956 Type 3. Every installation comes with product documentation confirming compliance.

### The Waterproof Basin Concept

Membriko installs EPDM as a continuous basin. The membrane rises up every wall to a minimum height of 150 mm above the finished surface level. It wraps around every drain with a bonded EPDM drain collar. It seals every penetration with a pre-formed EPDM boot or sleeve. The result is a watertight container: if all surface drains were to block simultaneously during a storm, water would accumulate within the basin but would not penetrate the structural slab to the room below. This is a fundamentally different engineering philosophy from systems that rely on water not finding a path — the EPDM basin assumes water will arrive and ensures it cannot pass through.

### Mechanical Performance for Accessible Surfaces

For surfaces carrying pedestrian traffic, Membriko specifies 1.5 mm thickness for standard residential use and 2.0 mm for heavy pedestrian traffic or commercial applications. At these thicknesses, EPDM meets the performance requirements of:

- Static puncture resistance: ≥ 20 kg at 2.0 mm (EN 12730) — resistant to aggregate particles in mortar beds, sharp furniture feet, and concentrated loads from planters
- Dynamic puncture resistance: Class E50 (EN 12691) — resistant to dropped tools and trolley wheel loads during and after construction
- Elongation at break: ≥ 300% — accommodates substrate cracking and thermal movement without membrane rupture
- Service temperature: -45°C to +150°C — the full range from frost-prone interior Portugal winters to Algarve rooftop summer conditions

## Finish System Compatibility

The most persistent misconception about EPDM in terrace and balcony applications is that it is only suitable as an exposed surface. In practice, EPDM is the most versatile waterproofing membrane in terms of finish system compatibility precisely because it functions as a hidden layer, separated from the surface finish by a protection course. Membriko has installed EPDM under all four major finish systems used on Portuguese terraces.

### Ceramic and Porcelain Tile

Ceramic and porcelain are the most common terrace finishes in Portugal. The correct assembly above EPDM is:

1. EPDM membrane (1.5-2.0 mm)
2. Protective geotextile fleece (minimum 300 g/m²)
3. Drainage nodule sheet (dimple mat)
4. Bedding mortar screed (incorporating the drainage slope)
5. Flexible tile adhesive (Class C2S2 per EN 12004)
6. Tile (minimum 5 mm movement joints at perimeters and at 3-metre intervals)

Ceramic is never bedded directly on the EPDM membrane. The drainage nodule layer between membrane and mortar bed serves two functions: it protects the membrane from point loads during construction and after, and it allows water that penetrates through tile joints to drain at membrane level to the primary drains. Membriko specifies only flexible, elasticised tile adhesive for terrace installations — the flexibility accommodates differential thermal movement between the mortar bed and the tile face without causing adhesive failure.

### Natural Stone

Limestone, schist, slate, and granite are frequently specified as terrace finishes in renovation projects, particularly in historic city centres and in higher-end residential work. Portuguese limestone — Lioz, Azul Valverde — and local schist are excellent terrace materials when correctly detailed. Key considerations above EPDM:

- Porosity: most natural stones are water-permeable. Water enters through stone joints and the stone body itself and reaches the EPDM membrane below — this is expected and the drainage system is designed for it.
- Weight: stone slabs at 30-50 mm thickness weigh 70-120 kg/m². Membriko always verifies structural capacity before specifying heavy stone finishes.
- Pedestal installation: for large-format natural stone on adjustable pedestal systems, a 300 g/m² protection fleece between EPDM and pedestal base plates distributes loads and prevents any point concentration against the membrane.

### Timber and Composite Decking

Hardwood decking — IPE, cumaru, thermally modified pine — and WPC (Wood-Plastic Composite) boards on adjustable aluminium or stainless steel bearer systems are the premium balcony finish choice in Portuguese residential and hospitality projects. Compatibility with EPDM is complete:

- Adjustable pedestals sit on the EPDM through a protection fleece. No mechanical fixing penetrates the membrane in the deck field.
- The EPDM membrane slopes at 2% to the drains; deck boards are levelled horizontally by adjusting pedestal height — solving drainage and accessibility simultaneously.
- Ventilation of the void between deck surface and membrane reduces membrane surface temperatures and prevents moisture accumulation beneath the boards.
- Membrane maintenance, when required, involves only removing deck boards — no destructive work of any kind.

Membriko recommends WPC composite decking over natural hardwood for most residential applications because it eliminates the need for annual oiling or treatment, which reduces the risk of chemical products making contact with the membrane surface.

### Concrete Pavers on Adjustable Pedestals

Precast concrete pavers on adjustable polypropylene pedestals are the most cost-effective accessible finish compatible with EPDM waterproofing. The system is quick to install, fully accessible for membrane inspection or repair (simply lift individual pavers), and provides inherent surface drainage through the minimum 5 mm open joints between units. Membriko always installs a protection fleece between membrane and pedestal bases and specifies a minimum 5 mm joint width between paver units to ensure adequate surface drainage.

---

## Drainage and Slope — The Foundation of Waterproof Performance

Inadequate drainage is the second most common cause of terrace waterproofing failure in Portugal, after absent or degraded membranes. Membriko designs a two-stage drainage system on every terrace project, not a single drain point as an afterthought.

### Primary Drainage: at Membrane Level

The EPDM membrane is installed on a substrate formed to a minimum 2% slope towards the drain positions. This exceeds the RGEU minimum of 1% and is chosen deliberately: construction tolerances in mortar screed execution mean that a designed slope of 2% typically produces a minimum measured slope of 1.5% at finish surface level, meeting both the regulatory minimum and Membriko's quality threshold.

Drain flanges at membrane level are EPDM drain collars bonded to the field membrane with EPDM adhesive tape, creating a permanent watertight junction — the joint most commonly responsible for failures in other systems. Membriko does not clamp drains through the EPDM without bonded collars. Every drain is a welded detail.

### Secondary Drainage: at Finish Surface Level

Surface-level drainage removes the majority of rainfall before it reaches the membrane below. For continuous ceramic and stone surfaces, Membriko integrates linear or point drains at finish level discharging to the drainage network independently of the primary membrane drains. For paver and deck systems, surface drainage occurs naturally through the open joints between units — no additional surface drains are typically needed provided joints are maintained clean.

### Upstand Heights

Membriko executes minimum 150 mm upstands at all wall junctions, parapets, and transitions to adjacent surfaces. In zones of high rainfall intensity — Porto, Aveiro, Setúbal, and other Atlantic-exposed locations — Membriko recommends 200 mm as a practical minimum, with 250 mm in locations where the terrace could receive runoff from adjacent higher surfaces. Upstands are terminated with mechanically fixed stainless steel termination bars plus compatible sealant — never adhesive-only terminations.

---

## The Membriko Installation Process

Waterproofing quality depends equally on the material and on the execution. Membriko follows a six-stage process with documentation at each stage, ensuring every installation is traceable from first diagnosis to handover with warranty.

### Stage 1: Technical Diagnosis

Membriko's technical site visit is free and structured. The team measures existing slopes, assesses drain condition and outlet positions, records all penetrations and singular points — corners, parapet interfaces, door thresholds, glazing frame junctions — and photographs the existing surface condition. A written diagnosis report is issued to the client before any proposal.

### Stage 2: Waterproofing Design

Based on the diagnosis, Membriko prepares a written waterproofing specification: membrane thickness and product, finish system compatibility, drain positions and types, slope correction requirements, upstand heights at each perimeter, and treatment of every penetration. This document is submitted to the client for review and agreement before any work begins.

### Stage 3: Selective Demolition and Substrate Preparation

Where existing finishes need to be removed, Membriko does so selectively — retaining substrate material that is stable and suitable for waterproofing. Concrete defects and structural cracks are repaired with epoxy or cementitious repair mortar according to the crack type and cause. Slope correction screeds are placed where needed before waterproofing begins.

### Stage 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

EPDM installation by Membriko is cold-applied throughout. No open flame. No torch. No high-VOC petroleum solvents at point of application. The membrane is bonded to the prepared substrate across its full surface using EPDM-compatible contact adhesive, with all wall upstands executed in the same membrane, all corners formed with pre-moulded EPDM corner accessories, and all drain interfaces sealed with bonded EPDM drain collars. All penetrations receive purpose-made boots or sleeves.

### Stage 5: Watertightness Testing

Before any finish system is installed, Membriko flood-tests the completed membrane installation. Drain outlets are plugged and water is applied to a depth that fills the basin to the upstand limit, retained for a minimum of 24 hours. The ceiling of the floor below is inspected during and after the test period. The result — pass or fail — is documented photographically. No finish is placed until the test is passed.

### Stage 6: Finish Installation and Handover

The agreed finish system is installed over the tested membrane. At handover, the client receives: a written diagnosis report, the waterproofing specification, the flood test result with photographs, a photographic record of all singular point details, and the Membriko 20-year installation warranty certificate.

## Balcony-Specific Engineering

Balconies share the same waterproofing principles as terraces but present distinct structural and geometric challenges that Membriko addresses with specific details and techniques.

### The Cantilever Movement Problem

Most Portuguese apartment balconies are cantilevered — a concrete slab projecting from the building structure, fixed at the building line and free at the outer edge. This creates a structural behaviour pattern quite different from a supported terrace slab: the free end deflects under load, the junction with the building facade experiences cyclic bending stress, and thermal movement amplitudes at the free tip are greater than on a supported slab of the same length.

The consequence for waterproofing is that the most critical and most stressed joint on any balcony is the slab-to-facade interface. Membriko details this junction with a continuous EPDM upstand bonded to the wall substrate and terminated with a mechanically fixed stainless steel termination bar. The bar pressing the membrane against the wall is the primary retention; a compatible polyurethane sealant bead covers the top edge as a sacrificial weathering element that can be renewed independently of the membrane if degradation occurs at any point over the membrane's service life.

### Narrow Balcony Drainage

Balconies narrower than 1.5 m frequently cannot accommodate a 2% longitudinal slope from the building facade to a point drain at the outer edge without creating a problematic level difference at the door threshold. Membriko resolves this with a transverse cross-slope — 2% from the building wall to the outer balcony edge — draining to a linear drain at the outer perimeter. The linear drain, in stainless steel with a bonded EPDM drain collar, connects to the building's rainwater downpipe system or discharges via a gargoyle over the facade.

### Balustrade Fixings

Post fixings for balustrades through the balcony floor are among the highest-risk infiltration points on any balcony. Membriko treats every fixing with a pre-formed EPDM boot or oversized sleeve, bonded to the membrane field with EPDM adhesive tape and sealed at the top with compatible polyurethane sealant. No exposed mastic sealant is left as the sole defence against water ingress at any penetration. The sealant bead is a secondary line of defence, not the primary waterproof seal.

### Working in Occupied Buildings

EPDM's cold-applied, no-torch installation method is a practical necessity in urban residential work. Membriko regularly installs balcony waterproofing on flats in occupied apartment buildings — above, below, and adjacent to residents — without any requirement for building evacuation, fire watch, or temporary relocation. The absence of open flame, the absence of petroleum vapour emissions at application, and the absence of strong chemical odours make EPDM the only responsible choice for waterproofing work in occupied residential buildings.

---

## Renovation — EPDM Over Existing Systems

The renovation of failed terrace and balcony waterproofing is the highest-volume segment of Membriko's installation work. The most common question in any initial consultation is: "Do I have to demolish everything?"

The answer, in many cases, is no. And the financial and programme implications of that answer are significant.

### EPDM Over Existing Modified Bitumen

Where an existing modified bitumen membrane is stable — fully bonded to its substrate, without blistering or delamination — Membriko can apply EPDM directly over it, following thorough cleaning and the application of EPDM bonding primer. The primer is formulated to be compatible with cured bitumen. Isolated blistered or delaminated zones are cut out and patched at substrate level before the new membrane is placed. On a 50 m² terrace, eliminating demolition and disposal of a bituminous system can save £1,200-2,500 in direct cost and reduce the programme by three to five working days.

### EPDM Over Ceramic Tile

Where existing ceramic or porcelain tile is fully bonded to the substrate — confirmed by percussive testing, with no hollow-sounding tiles, filled joints, and a reasonably flat surface — Membriko can use the tile as a waterproofing substrate for the new EPDM membrane, following surface preparation and application of bonding primer. This eliminates breaking-out work entirely, dramatically reduces construction waste and noise, and is particularly valuable in occupied apartment buildings where controlled dust and disruption levels are non-negotiable.

### EPDM Over EPDM

EPDM has a technical characteristic shared by almost no other waterproofing material: it can be chemically bonded to itself. Where a terrace has existing EPDM that is structurally sound and still bonded to its substrate, Membriko can apply a new membrane layer over the existing one using EPDM primer and bonding adhesive, creating a permanent chemical bond between the two layers. No demolition. No waste disposal. A completely renewed waterproofing system in a fraction of the time.

## Thermal and Acoustic Performance Benefits

A terrace or balcony renovation is an opportunity to solve three problems simultaneously — waterproofing, thermal insulation, and acoustic insulation — in a single project mobilisation. Membriko designs assemblies that integrate all three functions on request, particularly valuable in multi-storey residential buildings.

### Thermal Insulation

An uninsulated reinforced concrete slab has a U-value of 3.0-5.0 W/m²K — a significant source of heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer for the room below. With 60 mm of XPS (extruded polystyrene, thermal conductivity 0.033 W/m·K) installed beneath the EPDM membrane in a warm-terrace configuration, the assembly U-value falls to approximately 0.50 W/m²K. This 85-90% reduction in thermal transmission through the element has a measurable effect on the energy performance of the apartment below.

The Portuguese REH (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético de Habitações, Decree-Law 118/2013) sets maximum U-value thresholds for terrace slabs over habitable spaces. The Membriko warm-terrace assembly with 60 mm XPS meets or exceeds REH requirements in all Portuguese climatic zones. Membriko provides U-value calculations with proposals for insulated terrace assemblies on request.

### Acoustic Insulation

Impact noise — footfall, dragged furniture, children running — is the most frequent neighbour complaint in Portuguese apartment buildings and a significant quality of life issue for ground-floor residents with a terrace above. The RRAE (Regulamento dos Requisitos Acústicos dos Edifícios, Decree-Law 129/2002 as amended) requires Lnw ≤ 60 dB for impact sound insulation in multi-family residential buildings.

Membriko can incorporate a compressible acoustic isolation layer — 25-40 mm mineral wool or elastic foam board — between the EPDM protection fleece and the finish system bedding layer. This adds ΔLw of 15-22 dB of footfall noise reduction, typically sufficient to meet or approach RRAE compliance from a standard concrete slab. A single renovation project resolves the infiltration, reduces heat loss in winter, and eliminates the noise issue for the household below — all in one mobilisation.

## EPDM vs Alternative Waterproofing Systems

Membriko presents this comparison with objectivity. Each system has contexts where it performs adequately. The purpose here is to give the building owner and specifier the data to make an informed decision, not to dismiss alternatives without basis.

### EPDM vs Modified Bitumen (APP/SBS)

Modified bitumen — torch-applied felt in two or three layers — has been the default terrace waterproofing system in Portugal since the 1970s. Its actual service life in the Portuguese climate is 10-15 years for accessible surfaces, rarely more. The torch installation method presents fire risk in occupied buildings that Membriko refuses to accept as normal practice. The elastic elongation of modified bitumen (typically 30-50%) is insufficient to accommodate cracking in older concrete substrates — the membrane cracks at its most stressed points, which are also the most vulnerable to water entry. The cost of modified bitumen installation is approximately 20-30% lower than EPDM; the 30-year lifecycle cost including necessary replacement and consequential damage repair is approximately 40-50% higher.

### EPDM vs Spray Polyurea

Polyurea spray systems have grown their share of the Portuguese market over the past decade, driven by fast application speed and suitability for complex irregular geometries. Membriko's honest assessment for standard terrace and balcony applications:

- Effective service life of 10-20 years for accessible surfaces; recoating required at 10-year intervals
- Adhesion failure to inadequately prepared concrete is the primary failure mode — and substrate preparation on renovation projects is never as straightforward as on new build
- Cost per m² is typically 30-50% higher than EPDM for equivalent coverage, excluding the cost of the 10-year recoating cycle
- UV-induced colour fade in pigmented polyurea is a cosmetic issue for exposed surfaces
- Repair of point damage is difficult to render invisible — colour matching of spray polyurea patches is rarely perfect

For irregular surfaces where sheet membrane application would require many complex details, polyurea is a valid option. For standard rectangular or regular-plan terraces and balconies, EPDM from Membriko is superior in longevity, lifecycle cost, and ease of future maintenance.

### EPDM vs Plasticised PVC

PVC membranes have an established European track record of 20-25 years in terrace and roofing applications. Their limitations in the Portuguese context:

- Plasticiser migration is accelerated in hot, UV-intensive climates — membranes installed in the Algarve or Alentejo can begin to show brittleness from plasticiser loss within 12-18 years
- Chemical incompatibility with bitumen requires a full separation layer wherever the membrane contacts bituminous substrate materials
- Hot-air weld installation for seams requires specialist equipment and favourable ambient temperature and humidity conditions
- Chlorine content makes end-of-life recycling technically complex and limits disposal options

EPDM has no plasticisers to migrate, is chemically compatible with cured bitumen, uses cold-bonded tape seams, and is 100% recyclable at end of life. For long-term ownership, the comparison favours EPDM across every dimension that matters.

## Maintenance — What 50 Years Actually Looks Like

The maintenance regime of an EPDM terrace is one of the most practically appealing aspects of the system for building owners and property managers. Compared with every alternative system, EPDM requires the least intervention over its service life.

What EPDM does not need: recoating. Re-sealing of seams. Annual application of waterproofing treatment. Surface protection every five years. The polymer chemistry that makes EPDM resistant to UV degradation is intrinsic and permanent — it does not diminish over time, and it does not need supplementing with topcoat products.

What EPDM does need: drains cleared of debris before the wet season (twice per year, by the building owner, requiring no specialist knowledge). A five-minute visual inspection twice per year to verify no mechanical damage has occurred on any visible membrane surface. A technical inspection every five years as part of the Membriko maintenance programme.

If mechanical damage occurs — a puncture from a sharp object, a tear from a falling heavy load — the repair is a cold-bonded EPDM patch. The repair material is the same as the base membrane, the bonding is chemical and permanent, and the repaired zone has the same long-term performance as the surrounding membrane. A Membriko technician can complete most point repairs in under an hour.

The 30-year maintenance cost differential against modified bitumen (which requires re-application or significant repair work at years 10-15), polyurea (recoating at year 10), and PVC (seam inspection and potential hot-air re-welding of deteriorated zones) is substantial. Membriko provides lifecycle cost comparisons with all proposals on request.

## Portuguese Regulatory Framework

Membriko designs and installs every terrace and balcony waterproofing project in compliance with the applicable Portuguese and European regulatory framework.

### RGEU (Decree-Law 38 382/51)

Article 90 requires a minimum 1% drainage slope on terrace and flat roof surfaces in urban buildings. Article 66 requires non-slip finish surfaces on terraces, balconies, and external staircases. Membriko designs to 2% minimum slope at membrane level (to ensure 1.5% minimum at finish surface level after construction tolerances) and specifies finish surfaces with a minimum R11 classification (DIN 51130) for wet outdoor use.

### Decree-Law 163/2006 (Accessibility Regulations)

Buildings subject to accessibility requirements must provide terrace surfaces with a maximum 2% cross-slope on the finish surface, no discontinuities greater than 20 mm between adjacent surfaces, and adequate slip resistance for mobility aid users. Adjustable pedestal systems — with sloped membrane beneath and horizontal finish surface above — are the most effective solution for meeting both drainage and accessibility requirements simultaneously.

### RRAE (Decree-Law 129/2002 as amended)

The Acoustic Requirements Regulation sets Lnw ≤ 60 dB for impact sound insulation in multi-family residential buildings. Membriko's acoustic underlay assembly (25-40 mm compressible mineral wool or elastic foam boards between the protection fleece and finish layer) achieves ΔLw reductions of 15-22 dB, supporting RRAE compliance for renovation projects.

### REH (Decree-Law 118/2013)

The Energy Performance Regulation for Housing sets maximum U-value thresholds for roofs and terrace slabs over heated spaces. Membriko's warm-terrace assembly with 60 mm XPS achieves a U-value of approximately 0.50 W/m²K, meeting REH requirements across all Portuguese climate zones.

### EN 13956 / NP EN 13956

The harmonised European standard for flexible waterproofing sheets — synthetic polymer sheets (EPDM = Type 3) — adopted in Portugal as NP EN 13956. CE marking is mandatory under the Construction Products Regulation (CPR 305/2011) for all waterproofing products placed on the Portuguese market. All Membriko-specified membranes carry CE marking.

### LNEC ITE 44 — Technical Guidance on Diagnosis and Remediation

LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) Technical Information Sheets ITE 44 are Portugal's primary national technical reference for diagnosing and specifying remediation of waterproofing defects in terraces and balconies. Membriko follows the upstand height recommendations, drain installation details, and protection layer requirements in ITE 44 on all installations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can ceramic tiles be bedded directly on EPDM?**

No. Tiles must be installed on a drainage nodule sheet and mortar bed over a protection geotextile, never directly on the EPDM. Applying cement adhesive directly to EPDM restricts the membrane's elastic function and creates adhesion problems at the tile-membrane interface over time. The drainage layer between membrane and mortar bed is not optional — it is part of the correct system assembly.

**What minimum slope does an EPDM terrace need?**

RGEU requires 1% minimum; Membriko designs to 2% at membrane level to ensure 1.5% minimum at finish surface level after construction tolerances. For pedestal systems, the membrane slopes at 2% while the finish surface is horizontal — resolving drainage and accessibility simultaneously.

**Does EPDM withstand the point loads from pedestal support systems?**

Yes. Pedestal foot loads on EPDM are typically 0.8-1.5 kg/cm² — well within the membrane's static puncture resistance of ≥ 20 kg at 2.0 mm (EN 12730). Membriko always installs a 300 g/m² protection fleece between the EPDM and pedestal base plates to distribute loads across the membrane surface.

**Can EPDM be installed on a balcony in an occupied apartment building?**

Yes. Membriko's cold-applied EPDM installation uses no open flame, produces no petroleum vapour at application, and generates no strong chemical odours. Membriko regularly installs balcony waterproofing on flats in fully occupied apartment buildings without requiring any building evacuation or temporary closure of the building.

**What happens if the drain blocks after EPDM installation?**

Membriko installs the EPDM as a watertight basin with upstands of minimum 150 mm at all perimeters. If drains block and water accumulates, it is contained within the basin without penetrating the structural slab. The room below remains dry. Clear the drain and the system returns to normal operation. The structure's protection does not depend on drain maintenance.

**Can I put heavy planters and outdoor furniture on an EPDM terrace?**

Planters and furniture rest on the finish layer — tile, pavers, or deck — not directly on the EPDM membrane. Provided the finish system and underlying structure can carry the load, the membrane is unaffected. For planters placed on an exposed membrane surface (without finish layer), Membriko installs rubber protection pads to distribute load.

**What is the technical difference between waterproofing a balcony and a terrace?**

The materials and principles are identical. The main technical differences are structural: balconies are typically cantilevered slabs with significant movement at the slab-to-facade junction, and their narrower width often requires transverse cross-slope to a linear edge drain rather than longitudinal slope to a point drain. The junction detail at the building facade is the most critical and most technically demanding aspect of balcony waterproofing.

**How often should an EPDM terrace be inspected?**

Membriko recommends a 5-minute visual inspection by the building owner twice per year — spring and autumn — to check drain condition and the absence of mechanical damage on any visible membrane. Drains should be cleared before the autumn wet season. A formal technical inspection is included in the Membriko maintenance programme every five years. No periodic surface treatment, recoating, or seam work is required.
