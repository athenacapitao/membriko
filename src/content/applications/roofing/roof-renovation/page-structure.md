# Roof Renovation (Renovação de Coberturas) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Roof renovation is a distinct commercial opportunity from new-build waterproofing. The prospect who lands on this page is not choosing between building systems for a new construction — they are managing a problem that already exists. Their existing roof is failing, or showing signs of approaching failure, and they face a decision with significant financial and operational consequences: tear everything off and start again, patch what is there, or find a better path.

The page must address this prospect's specific psychological state: they are anxious about cost, disruption to an occupied building, and the risk of choosing the wrong solution. They may have been told by a previous contractor that demolition is the only option. They may be under pressure from tenants, building management, or insurers. The page's primary job is to dissolve anxiety by demonstrating that Membriko understands their situation precisely — and has a technically rigorous, financially superior answer.

The persuasion arc is:
1. Acknowledge the problem — validate that renovation is a genuine engineering challenge, not just a maintenance task
2. Establish Portugal's scale — this is a national problem, not an isolated one; the reader is not alone
3. Explain the decision — demolish or overlay? Lay out the framework honestly
4. Make the technical case for EPDM overlay — with chemistry, compatibility evidence, and performance data
5. Address each substrate scenario specifically — bitumen, metal, concrete
6. Show the process — make the invisible visible; the reader cannot evaluate what they cannot see
7. Integrate the energy upgrade opportunity — renovation is the moment to fix the thermal envelope too
8. Historic buildings — a specific audience with specific anxiety; address them directly
9. Financial case — cost savings vs demolition, plus Portuguese incentive programmes
10. Common renovation mistakes — pre-empt the objections and fears
11. Technical specifications — give engineers the data they need
12. EPDM vs alternatives for renovation — the decision a contractor might present differently
13. Why Membriko — the specific expertise claim for renovation, not just general EPDM
14. FAQ — 8 renovation-specific questions not answered elsewhere on the site

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Speak directly to the prospect managing a failing roof. Establish that there is a better option than demolition.

**Content:**
- Headline: "A Sua Cobertura Envelhecida Não Precisa de Demolição" / "Your Ageing Roof Does Not Need to be Demolished"
- Sub-headline: EPDM installs over most existing waterproofing systems — bitumen, concrete, metal — delivering 50+ years of new service life without the cost or disruption of full tear-off
- Four stat blocks: Up to 50% cost saving vs demolition / 50+ years new service life / 1-3 days typical project / 20-year new warranty issued
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico Técnico Gratuito" / "Request Free Technical Diagnosis"
- Secondary CTA: "Ver Como Funciona" anchor to process section
- Design note: Use a before/after split image — failed/cracked bitumen membrane alongside a new black EPDM installation. The visual contrast does the persuasion work.

## Section 2: Portugal's Renovation Crisis — Why This Matters Now

**Purpose:** Contextualise the problem at national scale. Validate the reader's experience and create urgency by showing the scale of the existing building stock problem.

**Content:**
- INE census data: 60%+ of Portuguese buildings built before 1990, most with waterproofing systems well past design service life
- Waterproofing failures represent 40-50% of all reported building pathology complaints in Portugal
- Construir Portugal programme: €2.7 billion allocated to renovation — government recognises the scale of the problem
- Cost of water damage vs cost of renovation: typically 5-10x multiplier when damage is left to compound
- Three sentences on Membriko's position: based in Pombal, serving the full country, Membriko has assessed and renovated hundreds of Portuguese roofs across all building typologies

**Design note:** Infographic with three data points (% of ageing stock / % of pathology from waterproofing / renovation cost multiplier). Keeps it visual and scannable.

## Section 3: The Core Decision — Demolish or Overlay?

**Purpose:** This is the pivotal section for a renovation prospect. It should feel like a trusted expert walking them through a decision framework — not a sales pitch.

**Content:**
Three-column layout: OVERLAY (conserve existing) / PARTIAL DEMOLITION / FULL TEAR-OFF

For each, list: When to choose it / Technical requirements / Cost comparison index / Typical duration / Who Membriko recommends it for

**Overlay is appropriate when:**
- Existing membrane is structurally bonded (pull-off strength > 0.05 N/mm²)
- Moisture content of existing insulation/screed is below 5% by weight (CM or impedance testing)
- No more than one existing membrane layer
- Parapet upstand heights can accommodate the additional membrane thickness

**Partial demolition is appropriate when:**
- Localised areas (typically under 30% of total) show delamination or moisture damage
- Blistering is extensive in specific zones
- Parapet or drain details require reconfiguration
- Existing system has two or more accumulated layers in parts

**Full tear-off is appropriate when:**
- Moisture is widespread throughout existing insulation (> 5% or detected across > 40% of area by drone thermography)
- Existing system has reached complete structural failure
- Thermal insulation upgrade requires access to structural deck
- Building regulations require compliance review that would be missed under overlay

**Design note:** Decision tree or three-column comparison card. This section should feel like an honest diagnostic tool, not a marketing piece.

## Section 4: Why EPDM is the Right Material for Renovation

**Purpose:** Technical authority on why EPDM specifically outperforms alternatives in a renovation (not new-build) context.

**Content:**
- Cold application: no torch, no fire risk — critical for occupied buildings and historic structures
- Chemical compatibility with bitumen (primary existing system in Portugal): documented compatibility with APP and SBS modified bitumen with appropriate primer
- Low additional mass: 1.2-1.5 mm EPDM adds 1.5-2.0 kg/m² — negligible for virtually all existing structures; no structural assessment required in standard cases
- Elongation advantage in renovation: existing substrates continue to move and crack as they age; 300-400% EPDM elongation bridges new cracks without membrane failure
- 50+ year service life means the renovation will not need repeating within the building's economic life
- No plasticiser migration — unlike PVC overlay over bitumen, EPDM does not chemically attack the substrate below it over time

**Physical properties table:**
| Property | Value | Significance for Renovation |
|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | Bridges substrate movement and new cracking |
| Added weight | 1.5-2.0 kg/m² | Compatible with virtually all existing structures |
| Application method | Cold (no torch) | Safe for occupied buildings and timber subframes |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | Handles Portugal's full climatic range |
| Compatibility | With bitumen, concrete, metal | Covers dominant Portuguese roof substrates |
| Service life | 50+ years | One renovation for the building's life |

## Section 5: EPDM Over Three Substrate Types

**Purpose:** Address the specific scenario the reader is actually in. A building owner with a bitumen roof needs different information to one with a metal shed roof or a bare concrete deck.

**Content:** Three tabs or expandable cards:

**A. EPDM Over Bitumen (Most Common)**
- Compatible with APP, SBS and oxidised (non-modified) bituminous membranes
- Process: condition assessment → blistering/delamination repair → full-surface cleaning → compatibility primer application → EPDM bonded with system adhesive
- Key risk: moisture in existing system — addressed by pre-installation infrared survey
- Typical result: the failing bitumen is encapsulated; its continued degradation is irrelevant because the new EPDM layer is structurally bonded to the primer, not to the bitumen below

**B. EPDM Over Metal (Corrugated Steel, Standing Seam, Profiled Sheet)**
- Mechanically fastened through existing metal substrate, or ballasted on flat metal decks
- No primer/adhesive compatibility issue — mechanical fixings provide independent attachment
- The new EPDM layer eliminates corrosion exposure on the metal below by cutting off oxygen and moisture contact
- Thermal bridging at fastener points must be evaluated for insulated systems

**C. EPDM Over Concrete/Screed (Stripped or Original)**
- Cleanest substrate for EPDM bonding
- Substrate preparation: grinding, levelling, priming
- Most common in commercial buildings where previous waterproofing has been stripped as part of a broader renovation project

## Section 6: The Membriko Renovation Process — Six Steps

**Purpose:** Make the invisible visible. Reduce purchase anxiety by showing the reader exactly what happens.

**Content:** Numbered timeline:

1. **Diagnóstico Técnico** — Free site visit: moisture testing (electronic impedance + infrared if >500m²), pull-off adhesion testing, blister mapping, photographic condition record, upstand height verification
2. **Relatório e Proposta** — Written report with drone thermography results (for large roofs), clear overlay/partial demolition/full tear-off recommendation with financial comparison, itemised proposal
3. **Preparação do Suporte** — Selective demolition of problem areas (if required), blister opening and drying, surface cleaning, application of compatibility primer to specified coverage rate
4. **Instalação do EPDM** — Membrane placement, bonding/fastening, full singular point treatment: all penetrations receive prefabricated EPDM pipe boots, all parapets receive mechanically secured EPDM flashings at minimum 200mm height, all drains receive EPDM-compatible sumped collar
5. **Controlo de Qualidade** — 100% seam probe test, electronic leak detection or flood test, photographic as-built record
6. **Garantia e Documentação** — New 20-year installation warranty certificate, maintenance plan, full project record delivered to client

## Section 7: Energy Upgrade Integration

**Purpose:** Show that renovation is an opportunity, not just a repair. Target building owners who are thinking about energy certification and incentive programmes.

**Content:**
- Renovation opens the roof for insulation addition at the same mobilisation cost as waterproofing alone
- REH requirements: maximum U-value 0.35 W/m²K for roofs in all Portuguese climate zones
- Typical pre-1990 roof: U = 1.5-2.5 W/m²K (4-7x above current requirement)
- 100mm PIR board over existing structure, under new EPDM: achieves U ≈ 0.19-0.22 W/m²K
- PRR / Recuperar Portugal grants: min. two EPC class improvement qualifies for non-repayable grant; roof insulation upgrade routinely achieves this threshold
- Combined cost: waterproofing + insulation together is 20-30% cheaper than two separate mobilisations
- Membriko coordinates the complete package: waterproofing specification, insulation selection, regulatory documentation

**Visual:** Simple cross-section diagram: existing structure → vapour control layer → new PIR insulation → new EPDM membrane. Labels with U-value before and after.

## Section 8: Historic and Protected Building Renovation

**Purpose:** A specific audience — owners of classified or pre-20th century buildings in ARU zones — with distinct concerns about planning consent and reversibility.

**Content:**
- Portugal's pre-1970 building stock: 34% of all residential buildings (INE 2021)
- Classified buildings and ARU zones: renovation requires DGPC or local câmara approval in many cases
- Why EPDM is the preferred solution for historic buildings:
  - Cold application — no torch fire risk in timber-framed or lime-mortar historic structures
  - Minimal height addition — 1.2 mm EPDM adds under 2 mm to parapet upstand height
  - Black colour is consistent with traditional Portuguese cobertura plana aesthetic
  - No maintenance topcoats required — no repeated access disturbance to historic fabric
  - Reversible — EPDM can be removed without damaging the substrate if future conservation requirements change
- Membriko's experience with ARU projects in historic centres across Portugal
- Documentation support: Membriko provides technical specification documents compatible with DGPC submission requirements

## Section 9: Cost Savings Analysis

**Purpose:** Rational financial justification. Give the reader concrete numbers they can use in an internal approval process or a client presentation.

**Content:**
Illustrative cost index comparison per 100 m² (not real prices — indices only):

| Approach | Initial Cost | Expected Life | Cost at Year 20 | Cost at Year 50 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EPDM overlay | Index 100 | 50+ years | 0 | 0 (still in service) |
| EPDM with partial demo | Index 120 | 50+ years | 0 | 0 (still in service) |
| Full demolition + new EPDM | Index 160 | 50+ years | 0 | 0 (still in service) |
| Full demolition + new bitumen | Index 140 | 15-20 years | Index 140 (replacement) | Index 280 (2 replacements) |
| Patch repairs (bitumen) | Index 25 | 3-5 years | Index 150 (6 cycles) | Index 375 (15 cycles) |

Note below table: "These are illustrative cost indices, not actual prices. Your specific project cost depends on roof area, existing system condition, access, and drainage configuration. Membriko provides itemised quotations after technical assessment — never per-m² ballpark figures that change on site."

**Incentive Programme Summary:**
- Construir Portugal: grants up to 65% of eligible costs in ARU zones
- PRR / Recuperar Portugal: non-repayable grants for min. two EPC class improvements
- BPI / Caixa Geral de Depósitos renovation loans: low-interest financing for qualifying rehabilitation projects
- Membriko assists clients in preparing technical documentation for grant applications

## Section 10: Common Renovation Mistakes

**Purpose:** Build trust by showing Membriko knows where renovations go wrong — and that our process prevents each failure.

**Content:** Six mistakes as expandable accordion:

1. **Overlay without moisture assessment** — encapsulating wet insulation accelerates structural decay and causes blistering of new membrane
2. **Primer selection mismatch** — wrong primer chemistry for existing substrate type; inadequate bond strength results in delamination within 2-5 years
3. **Ignoring parapet upstand heights** — existing upstands may be marginally above RGEU minimum; adding a second membrane layer can bring effective upstand below 150 mm, allowing water ingress behind flashing
4. **No selective demolition of delaminated areas** — bonding over delaminated areas creates a floating zone that fails progressively
5. **Skipping the quality control step** — renovation projects often have irregular surfaces and more potential weak points than new-build; 100% seam testing is more important, not less
6. **Failing to coordinate with energy upgrade** — treating waterproofing and insulation as separate projects doubles mobilisation cost; the renovation moment is the only economically rational time to do both

## Section 11: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Give engineers, quantity surveyors, and specifiers the numerical data they need.

**Content:** Full specification table:

| Parameter | Standard Renovation | Enhanced (with insulation upgrade) |
|---|---|---|
| EPDM membrane thickness | 1.2 mm | 1.5 mm |
| EPDM elongation at break | ≥ 300% | ≥ 300% |
| EPDM tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | ≥ 9 N/mm² |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | -45°C to +150°C |
| Additional dead load | 1.5-2.0 kg/m² | 1.5-2.0 kg/m² (excl. insulation) |
| Insulation (if included) | N/A | PIR 80-120 mm, λ = 0.022 W/mK |
| System U-value (with 100mm PIR) | N/A | ≈ 0.19-0.22 W/m²K |
| Parapet upstand minimum | 200 mm (Membriko standard) | 200 mm |
| Product standard | EN 13956 | EN 13956 |
| Membrane warranty | 20 years (Membriko) | 20 years (Membriko) |
| Moisture testing method | EN 12190 / impedance | EN 12190 / impedance + drone IR |

## Section 12: EPDM vs Alternative Renovation Systems

**Purpose:** Objection handling for prospects who have had competing systems proposed to them.

**Content:** Honest comparison table:

| Factor | EPDM Overlay | Liquid PU Coating | Liquid PMMA | New Bitumen (demolition required) | TPO Mechanically Fastened |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life after renovation | 50+ years | 10-15 years | 15-20 years | 15-20 years | 15-25 years |
| Recoating required | No | Every 5-10 years | Every 10-15 years | No (but full replacement) | No |
| Fire risk during application | None (cold) | None | None | Yes (torch) | None |
| Suitable for occupied buildings | Yes | Yes (odour caution) | Yes | Not recommended | Yes |
| Substrate moisture tolerance | Low — requires dry substrate | Moderate | Moderate | Low | High (mech. fastened) |
| Cost over 30 years | Lowest | Highest (repeat coats) | Medium-high | High (replacement cycle) | Medium |

Short paragraph below table: Liquid coatings are legitimate in some contexts — particularly for complex geometries with many penetrations where sheet membrane installation would require excessive field fabrication. Membriko assesses each renovation project individually and recommends the right system for the specific conditions, which is occasionally a hybrid approach.

## Section 14: FAQ — Eight Questions

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail renovation-specific search intent and reduce pre-sales questions.

**Eight renovation-specific FAQs (no overlap with flat-roofs.ts or flat-roofs/ page FAQs):**

1. **Posso instalar EPDM sobre uma cobertura com bolhas no betume?** / **Can EPDM be installed over a blistered bituminous roof?**
   Depends on severity. Minor blistering (< 20% coverage, blisters < 100 mm diameter) in dry areas can be punctured, dried, and sealed before overlay. Extensive blistering indicates widespread moisture in the existing assembly — those zones require selective demolition before EPDM installation. Membriko's moisture assessment maps blistering and moisture together, producing a clear demolition/overlay boundary plan before work begins.

2. **A sobre-instalação de EPDM é aceite pelas seguradoras de edifícios?** / **Is EPDM over-installation accepted by building insurers?**
   Yes, when installed by a certified contractor with proper documentation. The 20-year Membriko warranty is the key document insurers require. Over-installation by uncertified operators without documented moisture assessment is a different matter — that is a risk, and some insurers do not recognise it. Membriko provides the complete documentation package required for insurance policy updates.

3. **Quanto tempo dura a obra de renovação em 500 m²?** / **How long does renovation take on a 500 m² roof?**
   A standard overlay on 500 m² without significant demolition takes 3-5 working days. If selective demolition and insulation upgrade are included, allow 6-10 working days. Full demolition and reconstruction of 500 m² typically requires 2-3 weeks. Membriko provides a detailed written programme with the quotation so clients can plan building access and tenant communication in advance.

4. **O EPDM sobre betume pode ser inspeccionado por termografia de drone?** / **Can EPDM over bitumen be inspected by drone thermography?**
   Drone infrared thermography is Membriko's preferred pre-renovation assessment tool for roofs above 500 m². It maps moisture distribution in the existing system non-invasively, eliminating the need for random-pattern core drilling. Post-installation, drone survey can also verify the absence of delaminated zones in the new EPDM layer. We recommend pre- and post-installation drone surveys for all commercial renovations above 1,000 m².

5. **A renovação com EPDM melhora o comportamento acústico da cobertura?** / **Does EPDM renovation improve the acoustic performance of the roof?**
   The EPDM membrane itself has minimal acoustic mass. However, adding a layer of mineral wool insulation (in lieu of PIR) during renovation provides significant acoustic improvement — particularly for rain noise reduction on metal roof structures. For buildings where rain noise through existing metal roofing is a complaint, Membriko can specify a combined EPDM + acoustic mineral wool system that addresses both waterproofing and acoustic performance in a single renovation.

6. **A membrana EPDM nova afecta a capacidade de carga do terraço?** / **Does the new EPDM membrane affect the load-bearing capacity of the terrace?**
   A 1.2-1.5 mm EPDM membrane adds 1.5-2.0 kg/m² to the existing structure — less than a coat of paint. This is structurally negligible for any standard concrete or timber-framed structure. The load addition worth calculating is the insulation layer, if added: 80mm PIR adds approximately 3-4 kg/m²; 100mm mineral wool adds approximately 10-12 kg/m². Membriko provides a load summary in the specification document; where there is any doubt, a structural engineer's verification is recommended before proceeding.

7. **É possível renovar apenas as zonas mais danificadas em vez de toda a cobertura?** / **Is it possible to renovate only the most damaged areas rather than the whole roof?**
   Localised EPDM patching is technically possible but rarely the right decision. The existing system will continue to degrade around the repaired zone, creating new failures within 2-5 years. The economics of repeated mobilisation for localised repairs quickly exceed the cost of a complete renovation. Membriko's assessment will identify whether the damage is localised enough to justify a partial approach — in a minority of cases (< 10% of area affected) it is. In most cases, a complete renovation is the only economically rational decision.

8. **Os programas de incentivo como o Construir Portugal cobrem a renovação de coberturas de edifícios comerciais?** / **Do incentive programmes like Construir Portugal cover renovation of commercial building roofs?**
   Construir Portugal is primarily designed for residential buildings. Commercial buildings may access renovation funding through different instruments: POSEUR successor programmes for energy efficiency improvements, PRR Business Component for productive investments, and IAPMEI-administered schemes. Waterproofing renovation as part of an energy performance upgrade on commercial buildings can qualify under these programmes when the works are certified and documented. Membriko recommends consulting with a certified energy auditor to structure the application correctly; we provide the technical documentation from our side.
