# Roof Renovation (Renovação de Coberturas) — EPDM Research Summary

## The Portuguese Renovation Market Context

Portugal holds one of the largest proportions of ageing building stock in the European Union. According to the 2021 INE (Instituto Nacional de Estatística) census, approximately 34% of all residential buildings in Portugal were constructed before 1970, and a further 27% were built between 1971 and 1990. This means that well over half of Portugal's building stock was constructed using construction standards and waterproofing technologies that are now significantly outdated. Flat and low-slope roofs on these buildings — particularly the widespread cobertura plana popular in urban apartment blocks, commercial buildings, and institutional structures from the 1950s through the 1990s — feature waterproofing systems that in many cases have long exceeded their design service life.

The Portuguese government programme Construir Portugal (2024-2030), which allocates over €2.7 billion to housing rehabilitation, and the older IFRRU 2020 (Instrumento Financeiro para a Reabilitação e Revitalização Urbanas) programme that ran through 2023 represent the clearest policy signal of the scale of the renovation challenge. The European Renovation Wave initiative, targeting a doubling of annual renovation rates across EU member states by 2030, applies directly to Portugal and includes specific incentives for envelope improvements — of which roof waterproofing is a primary element.

Industry data from APCMC (Associação Portuguesa de Comerciantes de Materiais de Construção) suggests that waterproofing failures account for approximately 40-50% of all building pathology complaints registered in Portugal. The majority of these failures involve flat or near-flat roofing surfaces where ageing bituminous systems have oxidised, cracked, or delaminated. The cost of remediation of water damage — to ceilings, interior walls, electrical systems, structural elements, and building contents — routinely exceeds the cost of proper roof waterproofing renewal by a factor of five to ten.

## EPDM Over-Roofing: Technical Foundation

### The Compatibility Question

The central technical question in roof renovation is whether a new waterproofing layer can be installed over an existing one without full demolition of the existing system. For EPDM, the answer depends on the condition and type of the existing system.

**EPDM over bitumen (APP and SBS modified bitumen):** This is the most common renovation scenario in Portugal. EPDM is chemically compatible with bituminous membranes when installed with a purpose-designed primer. The key requirement is that the existing bituminous system must be structurally adhered to the substrate — not delaminated, not blistered with moisture-filled voids, and not exhibiting active movement at joints. Areas with delamination must be either repaired or selectively demolished before over-installation proceeds. In practice, well-documented European renovation projects have achieved excellent results with fully adhered EPDM over sound bitumen, with the EPDM primer creating a mechanically bonded interface that is immune to the ongoing chemical degradation of the bitumen below.

**EPDM over PVC membranes:** PVC presents a chemical compatibility challenge. Plasticiser migration from ageing PVC can attack certain adhesives and, in theory, the EPDM membrane interface. In practice, the risk is managed with a separation layer or a purpose-made EPDM-to-PVC transition primer. Independent testing by Carlisle SynTec has confirmed satisfactory bond strength of EPDM adhesive systems over aged PVC where the surface has been properly prepared. PVC membranes that are severely embrittled (plasticiser-depleted) present a more complex substrate — they may be brittle enough to crack under the mechanical stresses of traffic during installation.

**EPDM over concrete and screed:** Bare concrete or screed substrates, including those from which old waterproofing has already been stripped, represent the cleanest renovation scenario for EPDM. Standard bonding primer applied to properly prepared concrete provides excellent adhesion. The main preparation requirement is surface moisture content below 5% (CM method) and compressive strength above the adhesive's minimum requirement.

**EPDM over metal (corrugated steel, standing seam):** For industrial shed roofs and older metal decked buildings, EPDM can be mechanically fastened or ballasted over existing metal surfaces. Compatibility of any adhesive system with galvanised, painted, or corroded steel must be verified. In most renovation scenarios on existing metal, mechanical fastening through the metal substrate is the preferred system.

### Overlay vs Tear-Off: The Decision Framework

The industry's overlay vs tear-off decision is governed by three factors:

1. **Moisture content of the existing system.** If the existing insulation or sub-membrane layer contains more than a threshold level of moisture (typically assessed by electrical impedance testing, nuclear gauge, or infrared thermography from drone), encapsulating that moisture below the new EPDM layer will prevent it from drying and will accelerate biological growth, structural degradation, and potentially membrane blistering. The generally accepted European threshold is 5% moisture content by weight for most insulation types. Above this threshold, demolition of the wet zones (at minimum) is required before overlay.

2. **Structural bonding of the existing system.** An existing membrane that is delaminated from the substrate is not a stable base for overlay. If the new EPDM is bonded over a membrane that subsequently moves independently, the bond will fail. Adhesion testing (EN 12188 pull-off method) at multiple sample points determines whether the existing system is adequately bonded.

3. **Number of existing membrane layers.** Most building codes and roofing standards (including ETAG guidelines and national guidance) limit the number of accumulated waterproofing layers on a roof to two. Where a building already has two layers, demolition of the earlier layer is required before any new system is added.

### Energy Upgrade Integration

A roof renovation project represents the ideal opportunity to upgrade thermal insulation. In Portugal, the RCCTE (Regulamento das Características de Comportamento Térmico dos Edifícios), now superseded by the REH (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios Habitacionais) under Decree-Law 118/2013 and its revisions, mandates minimum thermal performance requirements for the building envelope. Existing flat roofs on pre-1990 buildings frequently have U-values of 1.5-2.5 W/m²K — far above the current maximum requirement of 0.35 W/m²K for roofs in all Portuguese climate zones.

Adding insulation during renovation — typically PIR (polyisocyanurate) rigid foam boards, EPS, or mineral wool in a warm-roof configuration — achieves compliance with current energy regulations and qualifies the project for incentives under Construir Portugal and EU renovation support programmes. A 100 mm PIR board (thermal conductivity 0.022 W/mK) contributes approximately R = 4.55 m²K/W, producing a total roof U-value of approximately 0.19-0.22 W/m²K when combined with the EPDM membrane, separation layer, and existing structure.

## Degradation Mechanisms in Ageing Portuguese Roofs

### Bitumen Oxidation and Photo-Oxidation

Bituminous membranes degrade through two primary mechanisms in Portugal's climate. Thermal oxidation occurs continuously at elevated temperatures — the surface of a dark bituminous membrane on a south-facing roof in the Algarve can reach 85-90°C in July. At these temperatures, oxidative reactions that consume the aromatic oils in the bitumen matrix proceed at measurable rates. Over 15-20 years, this manifests as surface hardening, increased brittleness, loss of cold-temperature flexibility, and surface cracking.

Photo-oxidation compounds thermal oxidation: UV radiation breaks the polymer chains in the SBS or APP modifier, destroying the elastomeric properties that give modified bitumen its flexibility advantage over oxidised bitumen. By year 12-18, a typical SBS modified bitumen membrane in Alentejo or Algarve conditions has lost sufficient elasticity to crack at thermal expansion joints and parapet junctions under seasonal temperature cycling.

### Bitumen Blistering

Blistering in bonded bituminous systems occurs when residual moisture between layers or entrapped air expands under heat, generating sufficient vapour pressure to rupture the inter-layer bond. Blisters can reach 300-500 mm in diameter and, once formed, trap water when they rupture after rain, creating a perpetually wet zone that accelerates underlying structural degradation. A blister map of a typical Portuguese urban flat roof over 25 years old frequently covers 15-30% of the total area.

### Parapet and Penetration Failure

Statistical analysis of building pathology reports in Portugal consistently identifies parapet junctions and roof penetrations (pipes, drains, service ducts) as the primary points of water ingress — responsible for approximately 60-70% of all roof-related water damage claims. These critical details fail first because they concentrate thermal movement stress (where the horizontal roof plane meets vertical elements), because they are the narrowest sections of material (where the waterproofing must wrap and bond around complex geometry), and because they were frequently executed with inferior detail work even in originally sound installations.

## Historic Building Renovation

Portugal's historic building stock — pre-20th century masonry structures with traditional cobertura plana systems — presents specific renovation challenges. Many of these buildings are classified or subject to planning restrictions that limit the visibility of new materials and the extent of structural intervention.

EPDM is particularly well-suited to historic building renovation because:
- It can be installed cold (no torch), eliminating fire risk in timber-framed or lime-mortared structures
- Its minimum installation thickness (1.0-1.2 mm) adds negligible height to parapet upstands
- Its black colour is appropriate for traditional Portuguese architectural contexts
- It requires no maintenance topcoats or surface treatments that would require repeated access

In classified buildings (imóveis classificados) or buildings in ARU (Áreas de Reabilitação Urbana), the renovation project may require approval from DGPC (Direção-Geral do Património Cultural) or the local câmara municipal. EPDM's minimal visual impact at parapet level — compared to torch-applied bitumen with its visible surface texture and sheen — is an advantage in these approval processes.

## Portuguese Renovation Incentive Programmes

### Construir Portugal (2024-2030)

The Construir Portugal programme, launched in 2024, allocates €2.7 billion to residential building renovation and social housing. Key provisions relevant to roof renovation:
- Non-repayable grants of up to 65% of eligible costs for works on buildings in ARU zones
- IHRU (Instituto da Habitação e da Reabilitação Urbana) manages programme implementation
- Roof waterproofing is explicitly listed as an eligible improvement category
- Energy performance improvements (insulation upgrade during renovation) attract higher grant rates
- Application through local municipalities or directly to IHRU

### BPI/IFRRU Model Loans

Following the IFRRU 2020 programme closure, successor financial instruments provide low-interest loans for urban rehabilitation combining EU structural funds with commercial bank lending. Roof renovation with simultaneous energy upgrade (adding insulation) qualifies as a multi-measure renovation package attracting the most favourable financing terms.

### Recuperar Portugal / PRR

The Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência (PRR), Portugal's implementation of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility, includes Component 2 (Housing) with specific provisions for building renovation. Projects that achieve a minimum two-class improvement in energy rating (EPC) qualify for non-repayable grants. Adding 100+ mm PIR insulation during roof renovation routinely achieves this improvement in pre-1990 buildings.

## EPDM vs Alternative Renovation Systems

| System | Typical Renovation Method | Practical Life After Renovation | Key Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| EPDM fully adhered | Over existing or on new substrate | 50+ years | Requires dry substrate; moisture testing mandatory |
| Liquid polyurethane | Applied over existing membrane | 10-15 years (recoat every 5-10 yr) | Surface prep sensitivity; UV requires topcoat |
| Liquid PMMA | Applied over existing membrane | 15-20 years | Higher cost; application temperature constraints |
| New SBS bitumen (torch) | Requires demolition of old system or specialist overlay | 15-20 years | Fire risk; adhesion to existing layer variable |
| TPO mechanically fastened | Over existing with fasteners through old system | 15-25 years | Seam integrity; UV degradation of membrane |

## Key Performance Data Relevant to Renovation

**ERA Field Study (post-renovation context):** The ERA study's finding that EPDM membranes 28-32 years old retained elongation values of 180-240% is directly relevant to renovation: an EPDM renovation installed over an ageing substrate is subject to greater substrate movement than a new-build installation, and elongation capacity directly determines whether the membrane can bridge substrate cracks without transmitting failure. The retained elongation at 30 years (well above the minimum) confirms that an EPDM renovation will not fail due to loss of material flexibility even as the underlying substrate continues to age.

**Moisture entrapment studies:** BRE (Building Research Establishment) published guidance on moisture management in roof renovation projects confirming that EPDM's very low water vapour permeability (approximately 15-30 ng/m·s·Pa) means it functions as an effective vapour barrier on the upper side of the assembly. This has implications for moisture drying potential: if moisture is present in the existing assembly, it cannot dry upward through the EPDM layer. This is the key reason why pre-renovation moisture assessment is mandatory, not optional.

## Summary: Why EPDM is the Leading Technology for Portuguese Roof Renovation

1. **Chemical compatibility with existing bituminous systems** — the dominant existing system in Portugal
2. **Cold-applied installation** — no fire risk, safe for occupied buildings and historic structures
3. **50+ year service life** — the renovation will not need to be repeated within the building's functional life
4. **Minimal structural addition** — 1.2-1.5 mm EPDM adds 1.5-2.0 kg/m², compatible with virtually all existing structures
5. **Incentive programme eligibility** — Construir Portugal, PRR and successor IFRRU instruments cover eligible roof renovation costs
6. **Integration with energy upgrade** — simultaneous insulation upgrade achieves regulatory compliance and grant eligibility
7. **Non-destructive assessment tools** — drone thermal survey can map moisture distribution in the existing system before committing to overlay vs demolition decision
