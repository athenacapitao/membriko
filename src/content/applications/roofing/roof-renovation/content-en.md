# Roof Renovation with EPDM Membrane

## Your Ageing Roof Does Not Need to be Demolished

There is a better path. The majority of Portugal's ageing flat roofs — the oxidised bitumen terraces, the commercial rooftops that have been leaking for years, the industrial buildings with perforated membrane — can be renovated definitively without the destruction, cost, and disruption of full demolition. Membriko executes this kind of renovation every day: installing EPDM membrane over the existing system and delivering fifty or more years of new service life to a roof that would otherwise be condemned to an endless cycle of temporary repairs.

This is not a technical compromise. When Membriko renovates a roof with EPDM, the end result — in terms of watertightness, durability, and warranty — is exactly the same as a new installation. The difference lies in the process: less demolition, less rubble, less time on site, less disruption to building occupants, and a significantly lower cost.

What follows is a complete account of how EPDM roof renovation works: the science behind material compatibility, the diagnostic process that determines the correct approach, the financial analysis that justifies the decision, and the Portuguese incentive programmes that can fund part of the project. By the time you finish reading, you will have everything you need to make an informed decision — and you will know exactly what Membriko will do to your roof.

## 1. Portugal's Renovation Crisis — The Scale of the Problem

Portugal faces a silent rehabilitation crisis. According to the 2021 INE (Instituto Nacional de Estatística) census, more than 34% of all residential buildings in Portugal were constructed before 1970, and a further 27% were built between 1971 and 1990. In total, over 60% of Portugal's built stock was erected using construction standards and waterproofing technologies that are now decades out of date. The flat roofs of these buildings — apartment block terraces, commercial roof decks, industrial and institutional buildings from the 1950s through to the 1990s — have, in the great majority of cases, waterproofing systems that have long since exceeded their design service life.

The cost of this reality is not abstract. Industry data from APCMC (Associação Portuguesa de Comerciantes de Materiais de Construção) indicates that waterproofing failures account for between 40% and 50% of all building pathology complaints recorded in Portugal. The cost of remediating water damage — to ceilings, interior walls, electrical systems, structural elements, and building contents — typically exceeds by five to ten times the cost that a timely roof renovation would have required.

It is in this context that the Portuguese government launched the Construir Portugal programme (2024-2030), allocating over €2.7 billion to residential building renovation. It is in this context that the European Renovation Wave sets ambitious targets for doubling annual building renovation rates across EU member states by 2030. And it is in this context that Membriko, based in Pombal at the geographical centre of Portugal, has established its position as the national specialist in roof renovation with EPDM membrane.

## 2. Why EPDM for Roof Renovation?

### The Compatibility Advantage

The first requirement of any renovation system is compatibility with what already exists. Membriko works with the right material for this task: EPDM is chemically compatible with the bituminous systems that dominate Portugal's existing building stock, can be mechanically fixed over metal without adhesive dependency, and bonds directly to concrete with the appropriate primer.

But compatibility is only the starting point. EPDM has specific properties that make it particularly well-suited to renovation contexts:

**Cold application.** Unlike bituminous membranes that require a gas torch for fusion and bonding between layers, EPDM is installed with contact adhesives at ambient temperature. On the roof of an occupied building — a hotel, a hospital, an apartment block with tenants — eliminating the torch eliminates the fire risk, eliminates the smell of hot bitumen, and eliminates the disruption of an installation process that would otherwise require temporary evacuation of the spaces below. Membriko executes EPDM renovations on buildings in full operation, without interruption to activities inside.

**300-400% elongation.** In a renovation, the existing substrate does not stop degrading. As the bitumen continues to age, it will crack, contract, and develop new points of vulnerability. A membrane with 300% or greater elongation accommodates this movement without failing. The EPDM installed by Membriko does not depend on the integrity of the system below it to remain watertight — it is its own complete waterproofing system, elastically independent of the substrate.

**Negligible additional mass.** A 1.2-1.5 mm EPDM membrane adds only 1.5-2.0 kg/m² to the structural load. This is less than the weight of a coat of paint. In virtually every building Membriko works on, no additional structural assessment is required to accommodate the membrane weight. When insulation is added, that calculation is performed — but the membrane itself is structurally irrelevant.

**50+ year service life.** The ERA (EPDM Roofing Association) field study documented EPDM membranes between 28 and 32 years old in active service that retained elongation values between 180% and 240% — well above the minimum required for aged membranes. The SKZ study, analysing 39 EPDM samples from European roofs, projected a median service life exceeding 50 years. A roof renovation with EPDM executed by Membriko will not need to be repeated within the economic life of the building.

### Chemical Compatibility with Bitumen

In Portugal, the vast majority of existing roofs requiring renovation have APP- or SBS-modified bituminous membranes, or non-modified oxidised bitumen. Membriko uses specific compatibility primers that create an adhesive interface between the EPDM and the underlying bitumen, regardless of the degradation state of the bituminous membrane.

This is an important point: once the EPDM is installed with the correct primer and adhesive, the ongoing degradation of the bituminous membrane below becomes technically irrelevant. The EPDM is structurally bonded to the primer, which is bonded to the bitumen. Even if the bitumen continues to deteriorate internally, the new EPDM layer maintains system watertightness. This is why Membriko can issue a 20-year warranty on a renovation — not because the bitumen below is reliable, but because the EPDM above is.

## 3. Assessment of the Existing Roof — The Critical Decision

### Demolish or Overlay?

The first decision in any roof renovation is the most important one: can the existing system be retained as a substrate for the EPDM, or is partial or full demolition required before the new membrane is installed?

Membriko does not make this assessment by telephone, by photograph, or by empirical instinct. It uses measurement. The demolish/overlay decision is determined by three measurable factors:

**1. Moisture content of the existing system.** The principal risk of over-installation is encapsulating existing moisture between layers. Moisture trapped below an impermeable EPDM membrane cannot dry out and accelerates biological and structural degradation of the materials below, potentially generating sufficient vapour pressure to cause blistering of the new membrane. The generally accepted European threshold is 5% moisture content by weight for most insulation types. Membriko assesses moisture content using:

- **Electrical impedance measurement** — grid measurements at 5 m² intervals for roofs up to 500 m²
- **Drone infrared thermography** — UAV survey at end of day, when wet areas retain heat and appear as warm anomalies in the thermal map; preferred method for roofs above 500 m²

Areas with moisture above the threshold require selective demolition before EPDM installation.

**2. Structural adhesion of the existing system.** A bituminous system that is delaminated from the substrate is not a stable base for over-installation. Membriko carries out pull-off adhesion testing (EN 12188 method) at multiple sample points. A result below 0.05 N/mm² indicates insufficient adhesion — that zone requires repair or localised demolition before the EPDM is installed.

**3. Number of accumulated layers.** Most technical codes and roofing standards limit the accumulation of waterproofing layers on a roof to two. Where a building already has two layers, the earlier layer must be demolished before any new installation is added.

### Three Renovation Scenarios

Membriko's assessment always produces a clear recommendation in one of three scenarios:

**Direct over-installation:** The existing system is structurally sound, dry, and comprises a single layer. Membriko installs the EPDM directly over the existing system with compatibility primer and contact adhesive. This is the most economical and fastest scenario, and the correct solution for most roofs under 25 years old with no history of flooding or extensive infiltration.

**Selective demolition and over-installation:** Localised areas (typically less than 30% of total area) show delamination, moisture blistering, or insufficient adhesion. Membriko demolishes only those zones, prepares the bare substrate, and installs the EPDM continuously over the entire roof — covering the intervened zones and the remaining existing system alike. This approach combines economy with superior quality.

**Full demolition:** Moisture is widespread across the entire roof, or the existing system has reached complete structural failure, or the thermal insulation upgrade requires access to the structural deck. Full demolition carries a higher cost and longer programme, but it is the correct response when conditions demand it.

## 4. Why EPDM is the Right Material for Renovation

### Technical Properties in a Renovation Context

Membriko's material selection for renovation projects is not arbitrary. EPDM's specific properties map directly to the challenges of the renovation context in ways that competing systems do not.

**Elongation bridges continuing substrate movement.** A repaired substrate is not a static substrate. The existing bitumen, concrete, or metal will continue to move, expand, contract, and crack as it ages. A membrane with 300% minimum elongation — and Membriko's specified products routinely achieve 350-450% — can accommodate these movements without transmitting the full strain to the membrane. The ERA study's confirmation that 30-year-old EPDM retains elongation values of 180-240% (well above the 100% minimum for aged membranes) is particularly relevant in renovation: the EPDM must accommodate substrate movement not just on day one, but across its own 50-year service life.

**No plasticiser chemistry interaction.** PVC membranes, when used as a renovation overlay over bituminous substrates, introduce the risk of plasticiser migration between layers — plasticisers from the PVC can alter the chemistry of the bitumen interface and, in turn, bitumen components can migrate into the PVC membrane, affecting its mechanical properties over time. EPDM contains no plasticisers. It neither contributes plasticisers to the existing system below nor absorbs them. The interface between EPDM and bitumen is chemically stable over the long term.

**Service temperature: -45°C to +150°C.** Portugal's rooftop surfaces experience a thermal range that most northern European test data does not fully represent. Surface thermography on dark bituminous roofs in Alentejo and the Algarve in July regularly records temperatures between 75°C and 85°C at peak irradiance. The same surface in a February frost episode may be at or near 0°C. EPDM operates well within its thermal comfort zone across this entire range, retaining full elasticity without creep, distortion, or accelerated chemical degradation.

**Physical properties relevant to renovation:**

| Property | Value | Significance for Renovation |
|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break (EN 12311-2) | ≥ 300% | Bridges ongoing substrate movement and cracking |
| Added weight | 1.5-2.0 kg/m² | Compatible with virtually all existing structures |
| Application method | Cold (no torch) | Safe for occupied buildings and historic structures |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | Covers Portugal's full climatic range |
| Compatibility | With bitumen, concrete, metal | Covers dominant Portuguese roof substrates |
| Warranty (Membriko) | 20 years | One renovation for the building's economic life |

## 5. EPDM Over Three Substrate Types

Membriko has proven experience renovating roofs over three primary substrate types that together cover the vast majority of situations encountered across Portugal.

### EPDM Over Bituminous System (Most Common)

Bituminous membrane — APP- or SBS-modified, or non-modified oxidised bitumen — is the most common existing system on Portuguese roofs requiring renovation. Membriko has executed hundreds of renovations over bitumen across the country, from Lisbon to Porto, from the Algarve to Trás-os-Montes.

The process: condition assessment and moisture mapping, repair of blisters, delaminated zones and failed areas, complete surface cleaning with high-pressure wash and controlled drying time, application of EPDM-over-bitumen compatibility primer at full coverage, EPDM installation with contact adhesive in a fully bonded system.

The result: the degraded bitumen is encapsulated beneath the EPDM. Its continued degradation — oxidation, contraction, micro-cracking — is irrelevant to system watertightness, because the EPDM is bonded to the primer, not to the bitumen. Membriko issues a 20-year warranty on this system because the EPDM above the bitumen is a complete system in its own right.

### EPDM Over Metal (Industrial Buildings and Long-Span Structures)

Metal roofs — galvanised steel sheeting, aluminium, aged sandwich panels — are common on industrial buildings, warehouses, large retail premises, and school and institutional buildings from the 1970s and 1980s. Renovation over metal has specific advantages: no chemical compatibility issues with adhesive because Membriko fixes the EPDM mechanically or by ballasting, and the EPDM immediately creates a barrier that cuts oxygen and moisture access to the metal below, arresting the progression of corrosion.

On flat or low-slope metal roofs, Membriko uses mechanical fastening with induction disc or ballasting — depending on structural capacity for additional ballast load. On corrugated metal profiles, the membrane is installed over a non-woven separating layer that bridges the profile geometry, with mechanical fastening at the crown ribs.

### EPDM Over Concrete and Screed (Clean Substrate)

When existing waterproofing has already been removed — either as part of a broader renovation, or because the building never had an adequate membrane — the concrete deck or levelling screed is the most favourable substrate for EPDM installation. Membriko prepares the surface by mechanical rectification of protrusions, repair of micro-cracks and discontinuities, and application of concrete bonding primer. The result is a clean, high-adhesion base for the EPDM contact adhesive system.

## 6. The Membriko Renovation Process — Six Steps

Every roof renovation executed by Membriko follows the same documented process. This is not a marketing framework — it is the operational protocol that produces a consistently documented, verifiable, and warrantable result.

### Step 1: Free Technical Diagnosis

Membriko always begins with a free technical site visit. This is not a sales call. It is a structured engineering assessment: measurement and documentation of roof area, geometry, and drainage configuration; inspection of the existing waterproofing system with identification of failure mechanisms; evaluation of substrate condition including pull-off adhesion testing and moisture measurement; identification of all singular points — parapets, upstands, drainage outlets, service penetrations, expansion joints; assessment of structural capacity for systems with additional insulation.

For roofs above 500 m², Membriko recommends a drone thermography survey as part of the diagnostic. This survey, conducted at end of day when temperature differentials between wet and dry zones are at their maximum, produces a moisture distribution map that guides precise delineation of areas for demolition or repair before over-installation.

The output of the diagnosis is a written technical report with photographic documentation, a clear overlay/partial demolition/full demolition recommendation, and a detailed, itemised proposal.

### Step 2: Written Report and Detailed Proposal

Membriko does not provide indicative pricing without prior assessment. A per-square-metre price given without assessment of specific conditions is a price that will change — usually upward — when actual conditions are discovered on site. Membriko's clients receive accurate, itemised pricing before work begins.

The proposal includes: full system specification (membrane, thickness, primer, adhesive, accessories), cost comparison between the renovation options identified, detailed work programme with dates, and documentation required for incentive programme applications (Construir Portugal, PRR) where applicable.

### Step 3: Substrate Preparation

Without selective demolition of the areas identified in the assessment, there is no quality. Preparation includes: opening, drying, and sealing of blisters; mechanical removal of delaminated zones; complete surface cleaning (high-pressure wash, drying); rectification of surface irregularities; and application of compatibility primer at the specified coverage rate, with controlled drying time before adhesive application.

### Step 4: EPDM Membrane Installation

Installation includes membrane positioning in pre-calculated formats that minimise seam count, bonding with contact adhesive in a fully bonded system, and complete treatment of all singular points. Membriko uses exclusively pre-fabricated EPDM accessories — pipe boots, inside and outside corners, parapet flashings — eliminating the need for complex field-formed geometry at critical locations. All parapet flashings are mechanically fixed at the top edge and bonded across their full vertical extent, at a minimum height of 200 mm above the EPDM field surface.

### Step 5: Quality Control

Before any Membriko installation is considered complete, every linear metre of seam, every termination detail, and every drainage outlet is inspected by a senior technician. Seam integrity is verified by running a rounded probe along the seam edge under moderate pressure. For commercial and large-area projects, Membriko employs electronic leak detection or flood testing before the warranty certificate is issued.

### Step 6: Warranty and Complete Documentation

Membriko issues a written 20-year installation warranty covering workmanship quality. This warranty is supported by a preventive maintenance programme: annual inspection visits that identify and correct any minor issues — sealant joint weathering at termination points, debris accumulation at drains, mechanical damage from subsequent trades — before they develop into active water ingress. Clients receive the warranty certificate together with the complete project documentation record.

## 7. Energy Upgrade Integration

Roof renovation is the most rational moment to simultaneously improve the building's thermal insulation. The team mobilisation, roof access, and exposed surface represent a unique opportunity: two works at the cost of one mobilisation.

### The Regulatory Context in Portugal

The REH (Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios Habitacionais), under Decree-Law 118/2013 and its revisions, establishes a maximum thermal transmittance coefficient (U-value) of 0.35 W/m²K for roofs across all Portuguese climate zones. Pre-1990 buildings typically have roofs with U-values between 1.5 and 2.5 W/m²K — four to seven times the current requirement.

### What Adding Insulation Achieves

A 100 mm PIR (polyisocyanurate) board (thermal conductivity λ = 0.022 W/mK) installed over the existing structure, beneath the new EPDM membrane, contributes R = 4.55 m²K/W. The complete system including the existing structure and EPDM achieves a U-value of approximately 0.19-0.22 W/m²K — well below the regulatory maximum and below the eligibility threshold for incentive programmes.

### Implications for Incentive Programmes

The PRR / Recuperar Portugal programmes require a minimum two energy performance certificate (EPC) class improvement for eligibility for non-repayable grants. The addition of insulation during roof renovation is, in the vast majority of pre-1990 buildings, the single most decisive factor in achieving this improvement. Membriko coordinates insulation selection and installation as an integral part of the renovation project — making the combined package eligible for funding that waterproofing alone could not claim.

---

## 8. Historic and Protected Building Renovation

Portugal has a historic building stock without parallel on the Iberian Peninsula. Renovating the roofs of these buildings — many classified or located in ARU (Áreas de Reabilitação Urbana) zones requiring approval from local councils or the DGPC (Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage) — presents specific challenges that Membriko understands and knows how to resolve.

### Why EPDM is the Preferred Choice for Historic Buildings

**No torch.** Cold EPDM installation is the most critical factor in historic structures with traditional Portuguese pine timber roof framing, timber trusses, or lime-mortar masonry. The fire risk associated with the gas torch used in bituminous waterproofing is real and documented — fires in historic buildings during waterproofing works occur in Portugal. Membriko eliminates this risk entirely.

**Minimal thickness addition.** A 1.2 mm EPDM membrane adds less than 2 mm to the height of existing parapet upstands. In buildings where upstands were constructed close to the regulatory minimum of 150 mm (RGEU), this addition is compatible with maintaining compliance. Bituminous multi-layer systems can add 8-15 mm, creating conflict with existing copings and flashings.

**Black colour consistent with traditional aesthetic.** Portugal's traditional flat roof surface — as seen from an elevated viewpoint in historic urban centres — is black or dark grey. Membriko's black EPDM is visually consistent with this character, unlike white or grey membranes that alter the visual reading of the historic ensemble.

**Reversibility.** EPDM can be removed without damaging the substrate if future conservation requirements demand it. It leaves no chemical residues, does not alter the composition of historic mortars, and does not introduce mechanical stresses incompatible with traditional fabric.

Membriko provides technical documentation in the formats required for approval processes before DGPC and local councils, including product data sheets, installation methodology, and a compatibility declaration for historic substrates.

## 9. Cost Savings Analysis

The following figures are illustrative cost indices, not real prices. Actual values depend on area, existing roof condition, access, drainage configuration, and insulation specification. Membriko provides detailed, itemised quotations after technical assessment — never per-square-metre ballpark figures that change on site.

### Total Life-Cycle Cost Comparison per 100 m² Over 50 Years

| Approach | Initial Cost | Replacement at Year 20 | Replacement at Year 40 | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EPDM over-installation (Membriko) | Index 100 | 0 (in service) | 0 (in service) | Index 100 |
| EPDM with selective demolition | Index 120 | 0 (in service) | 0 (in service) | Index 120 |
| Full demolition + new EPDM | Index 160 | 0 (in service) | 0 (in service) | Index 160 |
| Full demolition + new bitumen | Index 140 | Index 140 | Index 140 | Index 420 |
| Repeated localised repairs | Index 20 (× 10 cycles) | Index 200 total | — | Index 200+ |

The saving from EPDM over-installation versus full demolition and reconstruction with bitumen is 60-75% over a 50-year horizon. Even against full demolition with new EPDM, over-installation saves 25-40%.

### Portuguese Incentive Programmes

**Construir Portugal (2024-2030):** Budget of €2.7 billion for residential renovation. Non-repayable grant up to 65% of eligible costs in ARU zones, up to 50% outside ARU zones. Roof waterproofing is an explicitly eligible work category. Simultaneous energy improvement (adding insulation) increases both the grant rate and total eligibility. Applications through local councils or directly to IHRU. Membriko prepares the required technical documentation for grant applications as part of its service.

**PRR / Recuperar Portugal:** Minimum two EPC class improvement required for non-repayable grant eligibility. Roof renovation with 100 mm PIR insulation routinely achieves this threshold in pre-1990 buildings. Work execution deadline: 2026.

**BPF / CGD / BPI Renovation Finance:** Low-interest credit lines for qualifying rehabilitation projects. Combination with non-repayable grant allows most renovation costs to be covered with minimal recourse to own capital.

## 10. Technical Specifications for EPDM Roof Renovation

Membriko specifies its renovation systems on the following technical basis. This data is provided to all clients in the proposal document and is available to specifiers, engineers, and design practices.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| EPDM membrane thickness (standard renovation) | 1.2 mm |

---

## 11. EPDM vs Alternative Renovation Systems

Membriko acknowledges that alternatives to EPDM exist for roof renovation. An honest comparison serves our clients better than omission of alternatives.

| Factor | EPDM Membriko | Liquid PU Coating | Liquid PMMA | New Bitumen (demolition) | TPO Mechanically Fastened |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life after renovation | 50+ years | 10-15 years | 15-20 years | 15-20 years | 15-25 years |
| Recoating required | No | Every 5-10 years | Every 10-15 years | No (full replacement) | No |
| Fire risk during application | None (cold) | None | None | Yes (torch) | None |
| Suitable for occupied buildings | Yes | Yes (odour caution) | Yes | Not recommended | Yes |
| Substrate moisture tolerance | Low — requires dry substrate | Moderate | Moderate | Low | High (mechanical fixing) |
| Cost over 30 years | Lowest | Highest (repeat coats) | Medium-high | High (replacement cycle) | Medium |

Liquid coatings have legitimate application on roofs with highly complex geometry and a high density of penetrations, where sheet membrane installation would require excessive field-fabricated detailing. Membriko assesses each renovation project individually and recommends the right system for the specific conditions — including hybrid approaches where EPDM sheet combined with liquid-applied detail work serves the situation better than either system alone.

## 12. Common Renovation Mistakes and How Membriko Prevents Them

Membriko regularly diagnoses failed renovations executed by other operators. The following mistakes are the most frequently encountered — and all are preventable with the correct process.

**1. Over-installation without moisture assessment.** Encapsulating existing moisture below an impermeable EPDM membrane prevents drying and accelerates structural decay. Membriko makes moisture assessment mandatory — not optional — in every renovation, regardless of project scale.

**2. Wrong primer for the substrate type.** The incorrect primer chemistry for the existing membrane type (bitumen versus PVC versus screed) produces insufficient adhesion that fails progressively in the first two to five years. Membriko specifies the correct primer for each substrate and verifies adhesion after cure.

**3. Ignoring existing parapet upstand heights.** Upstands already close to the RGEU regulatory minimum of 150 mm may fall below that minimum after a second membrane layer is added. Membriko measures existing upstand heights during diagnosis and, where necessary, specifies raising the top edge of the parapet flashing before installation.

**4. Failing to demolish delaminated areas.** Bonding EPDM over delaminated zones creates a floating area that fails progressively under thermal cycling and wind. Membriko delimits and removes all delaminated areas before any installation proceeds.

**5. Skipping quality control.** In renovations, surfaces are more irregular and there are more potentially vulnerable points than in a new-build installation. Quality control is more important in this context, not less. Membriko carries out 100% seam inspection and detail testing before any project is signed off.

**6. Separating waterproofing from energy upgrade.** Treating waterproofing and insulation as two separate projects doubles mobilisation cost and can result in lost eligibility for incentive programmes that require an integrated approach. Membriko coordinates both elements in a single proposal.

## 13. Portuguese Renovation Incentive Programmes in Detail

Understanding the available financial support is part of making the right renovation decision. Membriko advises clients on incentive eligibility as part of the technical assessment service.

### Construir Portugal (2024-2030)

Portugal's largest housing rehabilitation programme to date. Budget of €2.7 billion distributed through IHRU (Instituto da Habitação e da Reabilitação Urbana). Key provisions:
- Non-repayable grants up to 65% of eligible costs in ARU (Áreas de Reabilitação Urbana) zones
- Up to 50% grant for eligible buildings outside ARU zones
- Roof waterproofing is explicitly listed as an eligible improvement category
- Simultaneous energy performance improvement (adding insulation) increases grant rate and broadens eligibility
- Applications submitted through local municipalities or directly to IHRU
- Membriko provides: technical specification, condition report, photographic evidence documentation, and certified invoicing — all materials required for grant submission

### PRR / Recuperar Portugal — Housing Component

The Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência is Portugal's implementation of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility. Component 2 (Housing) funds building renovation achieving a minimum two-class EPC improvement. Roof renovation with 100 mm PIR insulation installed by Membriko routinely achieves this threshold in pre-1990 buildings, converting roofs from F or G class contribution to B or C. Works must be committed by 2026 for PRR eligibility.

### BPF and Commercial Bank Renovation Finance

Banco Português de Fomento low-interest renovation loans and commercial bank credit lines (Caixa Geral de Depósitos, BPI, Millennium BCP renovation products) provide subsidised financing for qualifying rehabilitation projects. Combining a non-repayable grant with a low-interest loan allows most renovation costs to be covered with very limited recourse to own capital. Membriko recommends clients engage their bank or a financial adviser once the Membriko technical assessment has established the scope and budget of works.

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions About EPDM Roof Renovation

**Can EPDM be installed over a blistered bituminous roof?**

This depends on the severity and cause of the blistering. Minor blistering — less than 20% area coverage, blisters smaller than 100 mm diameter in dry zones — can be punctured, dried, and sealed before over-installation. Extensive blistering indicates widespread moisture in the existing assembly: those zones require selective demolition before EPDM installation. Membriko's moisture assessment maps blistering and moisture together, producing a clear demolition/overlay boundary plan before work begins. There are no surprises on site because the work is planned on the ground first.

**Is EPDM over-installation accepted by building insurers?**

Yes, when installed by a certified contractor with proper documentation. The Membriko 20-year warranty is the key document that insurers require. Over-installation by uncertified operators without documented moisture assessment is a different matter — that carries genuine risk, and some insurers do not recognise it. Membriko provides the complete documentation package required for building insurance policy updates, including the warranty certificate, installation method statement, and quality control records.

**How long does renovation take on a 500 m² roof?**

A standard over-installation on 500 m² without significant demolition takes 3-5 working days. Where selective demolition and insulation upgrade are included, allow 6-10 working days. Full demolition and reconstruction of 500 m² typically takes 2-3 weeks. Membriko provides a detailed written work programme with every quotation so clients can plan building access and occupant communication in advance — there are no surprises on start date or completion date.

**Can EPDM over bitumen be inspected by drone thermography?**

Drone infrared thermography is Membriko's preferred pre-renovation assessment tool for roofs above 500 m². It maps moisture distribution in the existing system non-invasively, eliminating the need for random-pattern core drilling that damages the existing membrane and produces only point data. Post-installation, drone survey can also verify the absence of delaminated zones in the new EPDM layer. Membriko recommends pre- and post-installation drone surveys for all commercial renovations above 1,000 m² — the cost is marginal against the value of the documented system performance record.

**Does EPDM renovation improve the acoustic performance of the roof?**

The EPDM membrane itself has minimal acoustic mass. However, adding a layer of acoustic-grade mineral wool insulation — in place of or alongside PIR — during renovation provides significant acoustic improvement, particularly for rain noise reduction on metal roof structures. For buildings where rain noise through existing metal roofing is a complaint from occupants or tenants, Membriko can specify a combined EPDM with acoustic mineral wool system that resolves both the waterproofing failure and the acoustic problem in a single renovation. This is a common specification in the refurbishment of schools, light industrial buildings, and commercial premises with existing profiled steel roofing.

**Does the new EPDM membrane affect the load-bearing capacity of the roof structure?**

A 1.2-1.5 mm EPDM membrane adds 1.5-2.0 kg/m² to the existing structure — less than the weight of a coat of paint. This is structurally negligible for any standard concrete or timber-framed structure and requires no structural verification in normal circumstances. The load addition that merits calculation is the insulation layer, when included: 80 mm PIR adds approximately 3-4 kg/m²; 100 mm mineral wool adds approximately 10-12 kg/m². Membriko provides a load summary in the specification document; where any doubt exists regarding structural capacity, Membriko recommends structural engineer verification before proceeding.

**Is it possible to renovate only the most damaged areas rather than the whole roof?**

Localised EPDM patching is technically possible but is rarely the economically correct decision. The existing system surrounding the repaired zone will continue to degrade, creating new failures within 2-5 years. The cumulative cost of repeated mobilisations for localised repairs quickly exceeds the cost of a complete renovation. Membriko's assessment identifies whether damage is localised enough to justify a partial approach — in fewer than 10% of assessed roofs is this the case. In the remaining 90%, a complete renovation is the only economically rational decision, and Membriko will say so clearly rather than recommending what the client may initially want to hear.

**Do programmes like Construir Portugal cover renovation of commercial building roofs?**

Construir Portugal is primarily designed for residential buildings. Commercial buildings may access renovation funding through different instruments: successor programmes to POSEUR for energy efficiency improvements, the PRR Business Component for productive investments, and IAPMEI-administered schemes. Roof waterproofing renovation as part of an energy performance upgrade on commercial buildings can qualify under these programmes when the works are certified and properly documented. Membriko recommends that commercial building owners consult a certified energy auditor to structure the grant application correctly; Membriko provides all required technical documentation from the waterproofing side of the project.

## Why Membriko for Your Roof Renovation

Membriko is not a general building contractor that also happens to install EPDM. We are a company specialising exclusively in EPDM rubber membrane, with every technician trained and certified specifically in this material and this process. This specialisation has direct consequences for the quality of the renovation we deliver.

When Membriko diagnoses your roof, the assessment is carried out by technicians who have seen dozens of different failure configurations in the same substrate type. When Membriko specifies the renovation system, the correct primer, adhesive, and accessories are selected for the specific situation — not the product available in the warehouse that week. When Membriko installs, every technician follows the same documented process that has been refined across hundreds of renovations across Portugal.

The result is measurable: a 20-year warranty issued with conviction, not as a marketing instrument. Membriko does not issue warranties it cannot honour — and it honours the warranty by supporting it with annual preventive maintenance visits that detect and correct any minor issue before it becomes an active failure.

Based in Pombal at the centre of Portugal, Membriko serves the entire national territory — from Lisbon to Porto, from the Algarve to the Beira Interior. If your roof is ageing, leaking, or approaching the end of its service life, the first step is our free technical diagnosis. The assessment carries no cost and no obligation. The proposal that follows will be accurate, documented, and will compare the available options for your specific situation clearly and honestly.
