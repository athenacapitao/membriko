# Pitched Roof Waterproofing with EPDM Membrane

## Why Pitched Roofs Need Secondary Waterproofing

There is a dangerous assumption embedded in how most Portuguese homeowners think about their roofs. The assumption is this: tiles are waterproof, therefore the roof is waterproof. This belief — which has been the default position of domestic construction culture for centuries — is incorrect, and every year it costs building owners across Portugal thousands of euros in structural timber repairs, interior finishes remediation, and emergency call-outs during Atlantic storms.

Tiles are not waterproof. They are weather-resistant cladding. The distinction is critical. A Portuguese roof tile — whether ceramic Telha Lusa, Marselha, Canudo, concrete, slate, or zinc — is designed to shed the majority of rainfall that strikes its outer face. In dry conditions with light rain falling vertically, tiles perform this function well. In the conditions that actually matter — sustained horizontal wind, driving rain, extreme thermal events, or simple aging — tiles routinely fail to provide complete protection against water ingress.

Wind-driven rain, which the Portuguese climate delivers with particular force across the Atlantic-facing coastline and mountain regions, does not fall vertically. It strikes roof surfaces at angles from horizontal to near-vertical depending on wind speed and direction. At these angles, rain is driven beneath tile laps, through micro-gaps between adjacent tiles, and upward against the underside of roof tiles by wind pressure. A standard ceramic tile overlap of 80 to 100 mm provides adequate gravity drainage but virtually no resistance to rain driven by winds above 60 km/h. At the 120–160 km/h gusts that Portuguese coastal and mountain regions experience during Atlantic depression passages, wind-driven rain penetrates tile-only roof systems without difficulty.

Tile breakage is a second and persistent vulnerability. Ceramic roof tiles are brittle. Thermal cycling — the repeated expansion and contraction caused by Portugal's substantial daily and seasonal temperature swings — generates progressive microcracking in glazed and unglazed ceramic surfaces. A tile that survives ten winters may crack under the eleventh. A single cracked tile directly above a timber purlin, rafter, or wall plate junction can admit enough water during a storm to saturate structural timber and begin the decay cycle that ends in a full structural repair. Maintenance inspection cycles in residential construction are typically annual at best, and in practice many owners inspect their roofs only after water has already appeared on interior ceilings — by which point structural timber may have been wet for months.

Aging compounds every vulnerability. Tile surface coatings weather and become more porous. Mortar at ridge, hip, and valley junctions carbonates and loses elasticity, eventually cracking and admitting water at exactly the points where roof geometry concentrates runoff. Lead and aluminium flashings at chimney bases, dormer cheeks, and skylight perimeters oxidise and fatigue. The cumulative effect is a roof whose tile-level waterproofing has been steadily declining for fifteen or twenty years while the building owner assumed it remained intact.

The solution — the engineering solution, not the cosmetic patch — is secondary waterproofing. A continuous, fully waterproof membrane installed beneath the tiles, covering every square centimetre of the roof structure from eave to ridge, transforms the tile layer from the building's sole water barrier into its first line of defence. The membrane becomes the true waterproofing layer. Tiles serve their original purpose: wind and UV protection for the membrane beneath.

Membriko was established in Pombal, in the geographic centre of Portugal, to deliver this solution across the country. Our specialisation is EPDM rubber membrane application — a material we have selected not on the basis of commercial availability or margin, but because decades of independent research and real-world performance data identify it as the technically superior choice for Portuguese climatic conditions. This page explains why, and how Membriko delivers it.

## Why EPDM Outperforms Traditional Roof Underlays

The roof underlay market contains a spectrum of materials, from bituminous sarking felt at the lowest performance end to high-specification breathable membranes and vulcanised rubber at the highest. Understanding why EPDM occupies the premium position — and why the premium is justified — requires an understanding of polymer chemistry.

**The chemistry of EPDM.** Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer rubber is a synthetic elastomer whose polymer backbone consists primarily of ethylene and propylene monomers. Both are fully saturated hydrocarbons — meaning all carbon-carbon bonds in the main chain are single bonds with no residual sites for chemical reaction. This saturated backbone is chemically inert to ultraviolet radiation and atmospheric ozone, the two primary agents of outdoor polymer degradation. UV resistance is not achieved through sacrificial UV stabiliser additives that deplete over time: it is intrinsic to EPDM's molecular structure. A small quantity of a diene monomer — most commonly 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) — is incorporated into the chain to provide vulcanisation sites, and the entire polymer network is cross-linked with sulphur during membrane manufacture. The result is a thermoset rubber: permanently elastic, dimensionally stable, and resistant to the full range of environmental stressors it will encounter in roof service.

**Temperature performance: -45°C to +130°C.** Under roof tiles on a summer afternoon in Portugal's interior, membrane surface temperatures can reach 85°C to 90°C. This is not a theoretical scenario — surface thermometry on dark-coloured roof structures in Alentejo and the Algarve consistently records these values during July and August. Bituminous underlays — traditional felt, APP-modified bitumen, and SBS-modified bitumen — soften and flow at temperatures between 60°C and 80°C. They do not melt visibly (the tile above conceals any surface deformation), but the bituminous binder redistributes under heat and gravity, causing the material to thin at high points and accumulate at low points. After several such cycles, the material has lost dimensional integrity. In cold winter conditions, the same bituminous materials become brittle and inflexible: they cannot accommodate substrate movement without cracking, and those cracks are permanent.

EPDM remains fully elastic and dimensionally stable across a service temperature range of -45°C to +130°C. At 90°C it retains its original tensile properties. At -10°C, the minimum winter temperature recorded across even Portugal's coldest mountain locations, it remains flexible. The material that goes into the roof in year one has the same mechanical properties in year twenty as it did during installation.

**Elongation ≥300%: why it matters for pitched roofs.** Timber roof structures move. This is not a defect — it is an inherent property of structural timber. As moisture content varies seasonally (timber absorbs moisture in autumn and winter, drying in spring and summer), rafters, purlins, and battens change length and section dimensions. This hygroscopic movement is superimposed on thermal expansion and contraction and on any differential settlement in the building's masonry. A membrane fixed to timber that moves must be able to accommodate that movement without transmitting tensile stress to its surface.

EPDM membranes conforming to EN 13859-1 — the European standard specifically applicable to underlay applications in pitched roof construction — must achieve elongation at break of at least 300% in both longitudinal and transverse directions. In practice, the membranes Membriko specifies typically achieve 350% to 450% elongation. What this means in practical terms: a 10 mm crack opening beneath the membrane — far larger than any movement generated by normal timber structure behaviour — can be bridged by the membrane without that membrane reaching its tensile limit. For an EPDM underlay with 400% elongation, the membrane must stretch to five times its original length before it will fail. No bituminous underlay, and no woven or non-woven synthetic felt, comes close to this performance.

**50+ year lifespan versus 10–15 years for bituminous alternatives.** The EPDM Roofing Association conducted a landmark investigation examining five EPDM roofing installations with service ages between 28 and 32 years. Core samples extracted from these membranes — still in active service — were laboratory-tested for tensile strength and elongation. Results showed tensile strength values of 8.2 to 15.5 MPa and elongation of 287% to 514%, both meeting or exceeding original manufacturing specification and EN minimums. These are not failure statistics: they are the properties of membranes that had been protecting buildings for three decades and retained the capacity to continue doing so.

The SKZ (Süddeutsches Kunststoff-Zentrum) conducted Arrhenius thermal ageing analysis on 39 EPDM samples collected from roofs across Europe. Using standardised methodology that models the relationship between accelerated laboratory ageing and real-time service degradation, the study projected service lives in excess of 50 years for all samples. A separate Arrhenius analysis published in roofing research literature projected a median expected service life of 86.8 years.

Contrast this with bituminous roof underlays. Standard bituminous felt (Type 1F, Type 5U per BS 747 or equivalent) has a service life of 10 to 15 years under normal exposure conditions. APP-modified bitumen underlays extend this to 20 to 25 years under ideal conditions. After this period, the material has become brittle, has lost its lap bond integrity, and allows water infiltration — the very scenario it was installed to prevent. Replacing the underlay of a tiled roof requires lifting the tiles, replacing the material, and re-laying the tiles: a significant capital cost. EPDM, installed once, should not require replacement within the lifetime of the building.

## Pitched Roof Types and EPDM Compatibility

Portugal's residential building stock encompasses a remarkable variety of roof tile types, each with distinct geometric and hydrological characteristics, and each presenting specific considerations for underlay specification.

**Telha Lusa (Portuguese S-tile).** The Telha Lusa is the quintessential Portuguese roof tile: an interlocking single-lap tile with a curved cross-section that creates the distinctive corrugated silhouette of traditional Portuguese vernacular architecture. Lusa tiles provide reasonable rain-shedding performance at pitches above 25°, but the inter-tile gaps at the side laps are an inherent vulnerability to wind-driven rain at pitches below 30°. On pitched roofs with Lusa tiles at 25°–30°, secondary waterproofing is not optional — it is the only reliable protection against wind-driven infiltration. EPDM underlay is installed directly over the timber decking or counter-batten layer, with battens applied over the membrane to carry the tiles.

**Telha Marselha (Marseille tile).** The double-lap Marselha tile, introduced to Portugal from France in the 19th century, provides better rain resistance than the Lusa at equivalent pitch due to its double-lap geometry. However, the clay body of Marselha tiles is particularly susceptible to freeze-thaw cycling, and hairline cracks are common in roofs over 20 years old. EPDM underlay beneath Marselha tiles provides essential protection during the period between tile damage and inspection, which in residential practice can be a full winter season.

**Telha Canudo (Half-round tile).** The traditional two-piece Canudo system — convex cover tiles (capote) over concave channel tiles (caleira) — is characteristic of Alentejo and southern Portugal. Its relatively open geometry and minimal lap provide the least resistance to wind-driven rain of any common Portuguese tile type, and secondary waterproofing beneath Canudo tiles should be considered mandatory in exposed situations. Membriko specifies breathable EPDM underlay beneath Canudo systems to manage the substantial vapour transfer that occurs in buildings with timber roof structures and interior habitation.

**Slate (Ardósia).** Natural slate roofing, common in the northern regions of Trás-os-Montes and Beiras, provides excellent water exclusion when new but is vulnerable to delamination as slates age. Individual slate replacement on a roof with an aging nail-fixings is difficult without disturbing adjacent slates. EPDM underlay beneath slate performs the same secondary waterproofing role as beneath ceramic tiles, with the additional benefit of being unaffected by the slightly acidic runoff that weathered slate can produce.

**Zinc and metal sheeting.** Modern zinc-alloy, galvanised steel, and aluminium roof claddings are common on contemporary residential and agricultural construction. Thermal expansion in metal cladding is substantially greater than in masonry or ceramics: a 10-metre aluminium sheet expands approximately 23 mm for every 10°C temperature rise. EPDM's exceptional elongation makes it uniquely suited as a secondary layer beneath metal cladding, accommodating the full range of cladding movement without stress concentration.

**New build versus renovation.** New-build applications permit full integration of the EPDM underlay into the structural design: the membrane is specified at design stage, the timber structure is detailed to accommodate it, and installation proceeds in a logical sequence from eave to ridge before batten installation. Renovation applications — retrofitting EPDM to an existing roof — require more careful assessment. Tiles must be lifted in sections, the existing underlay (often degraded felt) removed, and the EPDM installed to the exposed structure before tiles are re-laid. Membriko has developed efficient renovation protocols that minimise disruption and allow most residential re-roofing projects to be completed within three to five working days, regardless of weather.

## Portugal's Climate Zones and Underlay Requirements

Portugal's climatic diversity across a relatively small landmass produces dramatically different waterproofing demands from one region to the next. Understanding this diversity is essential for correct underlay specification.

**The Atlantic North (Minho, Douro Litoral, Trás-os-Montes).** Northwestern Portugal receives the highest rainfall volumes in continental Iberia. Annual rainfall in the Lima Valley and the Serra do Gerês regularly exceeds 2,500 mm, with peak intensities during Atlantic depression passages of 50 to 80 mm in 24 hours. Wind exposure is severe: the Portuguese coast faces the Atlantic without any significant windbreak, and northwest gales routinely exceed 100 km/h during winter storms. In this region, secondary waterproofing beneath roof tiles is not a premium specification — it is a baseline requirement for any roof expected to remain weathertight for more than a decade. Membriko recommends fully breathable EPDM underlay with reinforced lap zones in all Atlantic-facing applications, supplemented by additional mechanical fixings at eaves and ridges to resist wind uplift.

**The Centre (Beira Litoral, Estremadura, Ribatejo).** Central Portugal, including the Pombal area where Membriko is headquartered, experiences a transitional climate — more continental than the northwest coast but still subject to significant Atlantic influence. Annual rainfall of 800 to 1,200 mm, moderate wind exposure, and a broader seasonal temperature range than the coast characterise this zone. Summer temperatures routinely exceed 35°C at ground level, translating to roof surface temperatures of 75°C to 85°C. EPDM's high-temperature stability is particularly valuable here: bituminous underlays under dark clay tiles in this climate zone face conditions at or above their thermal deformation threshold during every summer.

**Southern Portugal and the Algarve.** The Algarve and southern Alentejo experience Portugal's most intense solar irradiance — annual global horizontal irradiance values between 1,900 and 2,100 kWh/m², among the highest in continental Europe. UV degradation of roof membranes is correspondingly accelerated. Materials with UV-sensitive polymer backbones (SBS and APP modified bitumen, many thermoplastic polyolefin underlays) face degradation timelines substantially shorter than test data collected under Northern European conditions suggests. EPDM's intrinsically UV-stable chemistry makes it the appropriate choice for southern Portugal, where membrane replacement within 15 to 20 years of installation would be economically and practically disruptive.

**Mountain Zones (Serra da Estrela, Peneda-Gerês, Serra do Açor).** Portugal's mountain regions add freeze-thaw cycling to the existing Atlantic rain and wind exposure. Sub-zero temperatures occur repeatedly during winter, and snow loading — a load case that most Portuguese building design practice does not formally address — adds structural demand. EPDM's low-temperature flexibility of -45°C ensures that freeze-thaw cycles produce no membrane fatigue, and its elongation capacity accommodates any differential movement generated by frost action in the substrate.

**EN 13859-1 exposure classification.** The European standard EN 13859-1, which governs underlay products for pitched roof applications, classifies installation locations by exposure severity. Protected situations (well-sheltered, low wind, low pitch angle) may permit lower-specification underlays. Normal situations (standard residential exposure) require compliance with core EN 13859-1 requirements. Exposed situations (coastal, elevated, high wind) require products meeting enhanced requirements for water resistance, wind resistance, and mechanical strength. Membriko's specification process begins with a site-specific exposure assessment against this classification, ensuring that the product selected is appropriate for the actual conditions at each project location — not for an assumed average.

## Condensation Control: The Hidden Threat to Timber Roofs

Condensation within the roof void is a slow-acting structural threat that receives far less attention than wind-driven rain, despite causing damage that is at least as serious and considerably harder to remediate. Understanding condensation risk, and designing the roof assembly to manage it, is a fundamental element of Membriko's approach to pitched roof waterproofing.

**How condensation forms.** Warm air holds more water vapour than cold air. In a heated building with a timber roof structure, internal air at 20°C and 55% relative humidity — typical conditions in a Portuguese home in winter — contains approximately 8.6 g of water vapour per cubic metre. As this air migrates into the cooler roof space through gaps in the ceiling and plasterboard (a process driven by the pressure differential between warm interior and cold exterior), its temperature falls. At the dew point temperature — approximately 10°C for the conditions described — the air can hold no more water vapour, and the excess condenses as liquid water on whatever surface it encounters at or below dew point. In a timber roof structure, this surface may be the underside of the tile battens, the upper face of the ceiling joists, or — critically — the back face of a vapour-impermeable underlay pressed against the cold tile batten.

Repeated condensation wets structural timber. Timber at moisture content above 20% is in the range where wood decay fungi will colonise and cause structural degradation. The process is invisible until the timber has been significantly weakened: condensation within a well-tiled roof void is not apparent from either the exterior (the tiles look intact) or the interior (the ceiling plasterboard conceals the structure). Membriko's structural inspection protocol includes moisture content measurement of accessible timber members specifically because condensation damage at an early stage is reversible by ventilation improvement and membrane upgrade, while advanced decay requires timber replacement.

**Breathable EPDM: micro-perforated membranes for vapour diffusion.** The solution to condensation risk is not to eliminate moisture vapour transfer — attempting to create a completely vapour-impermeable seal at every element of the roof assembly is impractical and produces its own problems — but to manage vapour movement so that moisture can diffuse out of the roof structure faster than it accumulates.

Breathable EPDM underlays achieve this through micro-perforation: a controlled pattern of micro-pores formed in the membrane during manufacture that allow water vapour molecules to pass through the membrane in the vapour phase (diffusion) while remaining effectively impermeable to liquid water under the hydraulic heads encountered in roof construction. The performance metric for vapour permeability in underlays is the water vapour transmission rate (WVTR), expressed in μg/(m·h·Pa) under EN 13859-1. Underlays with WVTR values above approximately 0.02 μg/(m·h·Pa) are classified as vapour-permeable (breathable) and may be used in roof assemblies where the air gap between membrane and tile is the primary means of ventilation.

Membriko specifies breathable EPDM underlays for all inhabited buildings — residential properties, hotels, agricultural buildings with staff occupation — where the roof structure covers a heated and humidified interior. Non-breathable EPDM (solid, unperforated membrane) is specified for non-inhabited industrial and agricultural structures where interior vapour production is negligible.

**Ventilation strategy and Portuguese building regulations.** The RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas) requires that roofing assemblies over habitable spaces include adequate ventilation of the roof void. In practice, this is achieved through eave ventilation (typically a mesh-protected gap of 25 to 50 mm at the eave tile course), ridge ventilation (either through a vented ridge tile system or a discrete ridge ventilator), and an unobstructed air path between eave and ridge above the insulation layer. Membriko's installation details for breathable underlay applications always include eave ventilation provisions and ridge ventilation specification, ensuring compliance with RGEU requirements and adequate vapour management performance.

## Membriko's 6-Step Pitched Roof Installation Process

Membriko's installation process for pitched roof EPDM underlay is a structured six-step procedure that has been refined across hundreds of projects to produce consistent, zero-defect results. Every step is mandatory — there are no shortcuts that Membriko permits, because the consequences of skipping a step are defects that may not become apparent until the first storm event.

**Step 1: Structural Inspection.** Before any material touches the roof, Membriko's qualified surveyor conducts a systematic structural inspection. This covers the ridge beam (deflection assessment, bearing condition at gable ends), the principal rafters (straightness, section dimensions against design requirement, presence of notches or holes for services), wall plates (bearing length, timber condition at masonry interface, presence of vermin damage), purlins (span, section, fixings to rafters), and the underside of any existing roofing material visible from within the roof space. Moisture content is measured at representative points using a calibrated pin meter. Any structural deficiency identified at this stage is documented, and remediation is completed before the waterproofing work proceeds. Membriko does not install membranes over structurally compromised substrates — not because we cannot do so, but because doing so would produce a waterproofing system whose service life is limited by the underlying structural failure, not by the membrane's inherent performance.

**Step 2: Timber Repair and Preparation.** Structural repairs identified at Stage 1 are completed: sistering of damaged rafters, replacement of decayed purlin sections, repair of wall plate bearing zones. Loose or protruding fixings are removed or driven flush. The timber surface is inspected for sharp edges, splinters, or protrusions that could puncture the membrane under contact pressure or thermal movement. Where decking boards are used rather than open rafter-and-batten construction, any gaps between boards exceeding 5 mm are bridged with compressible backing rod before membrane installation.

**Step 3: EPDM Membrane Installation — Eave to Ridge.** EPDM rolls are positioned at the eave, with the membrane extending 50 mm beyond the eave fascia to form a drip edge into the gutter system. Rolls are worked up the slope from eave to ridge, with a minimum horizontal overlap of 150 mm at all sheet-to-sheet laps. On roofs with pitch below 15°, overlap is increased to 200 mm minimum. The membrane is draped over the rafter or batten structure without tensioning — it must sit with slight drape to accommodate thermal contraction without generating tensile stress at fixings. At the ridge, the membrane from each slope is lapped over the apex by a minimum of 150 mm and sealed with Membriko's ridge seam tape system.

**Step 4: Mechanical Fixing and Seam Sealing.** The EPDM membrane is secured to the substrate using purpose-designed polymer-headed mechanical fixings at a pattern determined by the design wind uplift calculation for each project. Along all sheet-to-sheet laps, seam tape (self-adhesive butyl-based) is applied to the full lap width after surface preparation. Seam integrity is checked by Membriko's quality controller using systematic probe testing: a rounded metal tool is drawn along every seam at consistent pressure to identify any unbonded zone. Detected deficiencies are repaired immediately before progressing.

**Step 5: Singular Point Treatment.** The most technically demanding element of any pitched roof installation is the waterproofing of geometric discontinuities: points where the membrane must be cut, shaped, and sealed to form a watertight junction with a penetration or change in roof plane. Membriko's singular point treatment protocol covers: ridges and hips (formed with EPDM ridge tape and liquid EPDM applied to the apexes), chimney flashings (EPDM cut-to-size apron and counterflashing, mechanically fixed and sealed into the masonry joint), skylight perimeters (EPDM pipe boot or flat flashing welded to the membrane field), soil and service pipe penetrations (EPDM pipe boot collars, available in a range of diameters), and valley details (EPDM valley liner, minimum 500 mm wide, lapped beneath the field membrane on both slopes). Every singular point receives a secondary application of liquid EPDM coating at all terminations to eliminate any risk of capillary migration at cut edges.

**Step 6: Tile Installation and Warranty Documentation.** Following Membriko's quality inspection and photographic documentation of all singular points and seam details, timber battens are installed over the membrane at centres determined by the tile manufacturer's specification. The tile covering is installed by the roofing contractor (either Membriko's own tiling team or a nominated specialist), and the completed installation is documented with a warranty pack that includes the membrane manufacturer's product certification, Membriko's application warranty covering workmanship for 15 years, and the photographic record of all critical installation details. This documentation is provided in both printed and digital form for the building owner's records.

## Application Techniques: Underlay vs Full Cover

Not all pitched roof EPDM applications follow the standard underlay-and-tile configuration. Membriko works with building owners and architects across a range of application scenarios, and the correct technique depends on the building type, use, aesthetic requirements, and budget.

**Breathable EPDM underlay for inhabited buildings.** The standard application for residential, hospitality, and educational buildings: a breathable micro-perforated EPDM membrane installed beneath a tile covering of the owner's choice. The membrane provides the structural waterproofing function; the tiles provide wind and UV protection for the membrane and give the building its architectural character. This approach is always Membriko's first recommendation for inhabited buildings, because it provides the full performance benefit of EPDM waterproofing while preserving the aesthetic relationship between the building and its context.

**Full EPDM cover for industrial and agricultural structures.** Agricultural buildings, industrial sheds, and outbuildings where aesthetics are secondary to performance and cost can benefit from full EPDM cover: the membrane is installed as the outer weathering surface, either loose-laid and ballasted or mechanically fastened without a tile covering. This approach is faster and less expensive than the tile-plus-underlay system, and for agricultural buildings the performance difference is negligible — agricultural structures typically have no habitation-related vapour management requirements and benefit from the reduced structural dead load of omitting the tile layer entirely. Membriko regularly specifies full EPDM cover for agricultural buildings across the Alentejo, Ribatejo, and Beiras regions.

**Hybrid approaches for complex roof geometries.** Contemporary architectural design frequently produces roof geometries that combine multiple pitches, dormers, roof terraces, and flat sections within a single building. Hybrid approaches — EPDM underlay under tiles on the pitched sections, and EPDM fully adhered waterproofing membrane on the flat sections — allow a single waterproofing system to cover the entire building envelope, with material continuity at transitions between pitched and flat elements. This continuity eliminates the junction vulnerabilities that arise when different systems meet: two different membrane materials, two different adhesive chemistries, and two different movement characteristics meeting at a single junction point. Membriko's hybrid system designs are developed project-by-project, with junction details drawn to scale and approved by the project architect before installation commences.

**Decision matrix.** The choice of application technique depends on four primary factors: (1) building use and occupancy — inhabited or non-inhabited; (2) planning and aesthetic requirements — tile covering required or not; (3) structural capacity — can the structure carry tile dead load; (4) budget — the tile-plus-underlay system has higher initial cost but typically the lowest whole-life cost due to EPDM's 50+ year service life. Membriko advises on all four factors as part of the initial project consultation, which is provided at no charge.

## Critical Construction Details

The waterproofing performance of a pitched roof EPDM installation is determined not by the average quality of the field membrane installation, but by the quality of its worst singular point detail. A perfectly installed field membrane is ineffective if the chimney flashing admits water during every rainstorm. Membriko invests disproportionate attention and time in the detailing of geometric discontinuities — because they are where roof waterproofing fails.

**Valley waterproofing.** Valley gutters — the internal angles formed at the junction of two adjacent roof slopes — are the highest hydraulic load points on any pitched roof. All rainfall collected by both slopes converges at the valley, generating concentrated flow velocities that can drive water beneath inadequate flashings by capillary action. Membriko's valley detail uses a continuous EPDM valley liner, minimum 500 mm wide (250 mm each side of the valley centreline), installed beneath both field membrane sheets and lapped a minimum of 150 mm under each. The valley liner is formed with a 30 mm standing seam at the centreline to create a raised central division that directs high-velocity flow down each half of the valley without allowing cross-contamination. All laps are sealed with seam tape and liquid EPDM terminations.

**Dormer roof integration.** Dormer roofs present the most complex integration challenge in domestic pitched roof construction: the dormer has its own roof, two cheek walls, and a front face, all of which must be continuously waterproofed and integrated with the main roof slope that surrounds them. Membriko's dormer detail begins with a comprehensive EPDM pre-formed apron at the dormer head — the junction between the main roof slope and the dormer back wall — and continues with continuous EPDM soakers at the dormer cheek junctions, turned up the cheek wall and mechanically fixed into the mortar joint before finishing with a counterflashing that laps over the soaker. The dormer roof itself receives the same EPDM underlay treatment as the main roof.

**Chimney and flue pipe flashing.** Masonry chimneys are the highest-risk singular point on any traditional pitched roof. They penetrate the roof plane, are subject to differential thermal movement relative to the roof structure, and typically have complex three-dimensional geometry. Membriko's chimney waterproofing uses a two-piece EPDM system: a pre-cut EPDM apron covering the front face and sides, bonded to the field membrane with seam tape, and a stepped back-gutter at the upslope face of the chimney that collects water deflected by the chimney and directs it to either side. Counterflashings are mechanically fixed into raked-out mortar joints, not simply surface-bonded — surface bonding fails as the mortar weathers and the fixing substrate degrades. EPDM pipe boot collars are used for circular flue penetrations, available in diameters from 50 mm to 250 mm, with a conical rubber sleeve that clamps to the pipe under thermal compression.

**Skylight waterproofing.** Roof lights and skylights installed within the pitched roof plane are waterproofed with a combination of the EPDM field membrane turned up the upslope face of the skylight kerb and sealed with butyl tape, and a pre-formed EPDM perimeter flashing bonded to both the field membrane and the skylight frame. Critically, Membriko always specifies a minimum upstand height of 150 mm from the tile plane to the base of any skylight frame — this minimum clearance prevents ponded water from standing against the frame junction during storm events.

**Ridge, hip, and eave detailing.** Ridge apexes are finished with a continuous EPDM ridge tape (a pre-formed two-part tape with a central fold) bonded over the apex with seam adhesive and mechanically fixed at 150 mm centres. Hip rafters receive equivalent treatment with purpose-cut EPDM hip tape. At the eave, the membrane overhangs the fascia by 50 mm and is directed into the gutter using a stainless-steel drip profile mechanically fixed through the membrane — the drip profile prevents wind uplift of the membrane overhang while directing water positively into the gutter.

## Pitched Roof Renovation with EPDM

The majority of Membriko's pitched roof work is renovation rather than new build. Portugal's housing stock includes large numbers of buildings constructed between the 1950s and 1990s with bituminous felt underlays that have either reached or exceeded the end of their service lives. For these buildings, EPDM renovation offers a cost-effective path to restoring genuine waterproofing performance without the expense of full structural replacement.

**Assessing existing roof structures for EPDM upgrade.** Before specifying an EPDM renovation, Membriko assesses three critical elements: structural condition, existing underlay condition, and tile condition. Structural timber with moisture content below 18% and no evidence of fungal decay can be retained; timber with moisture content above 20% or visible decay must be replaced before the new membrane is installed. Existing bituminous felt is always removed — installing EPDM over aged bituminous felt creates a system where the EPDM's 50-year service life is anchored to a substrate that will fail in five years. Tiles in sound structural condition can be cleaned and relaid; tiles with significant breakage, crazing, or loss of surface integrity should be replaced.

**Installing EPDM over existing tiles — industrial applications.** For non-residential industrial and agricultural buildings where disruption of the existing tile covering is undesirable, EPDM full-cover installation directly over the existing tile surface is technically feasible provided the tile surface is structurally sound, adequately fixed, and presents no sharp protrusions. This approach uses a protection layer (non-woven geotextile) between the tile surface and the EPDM membrane to prevent localised stress concentration at tile edges. Membriko advises this approach only for non-inhabited buildings because it creates a fully impermeable outer layer that would drive condensation into the building if used over habitable spaces.

**Timber structure repair and EPDM integration.** Where partial timber replacement is required — individual rafter repairs, purlin splicing, wall plate repair at bearing zones — Membriko integrates the repair work within the overall EPDM installation programme. New timber sections are selected for moisture content below 18% and treated with preservative at cut ends. All new timber is installed before the membrane, so the membrane covers a structurally continuous substrate with no intermediate joints in the new timber exposed to the roof environment.

**Cost-benefit analysis: full re-roof versus EPDM upgrade.** A full tile-to-structure re-roof on a 150 m² residential property — removing all tiles, replacing the underlay, and relaying new tiles — typically costs between €12,000 and €22,000 depending on tile type and structural condition. An EPDM renovation — lifting and stockpiling existing tiles, removing and disposing of the old underlay, installing EPDM, and relaying the existing tiles — typically costs between €7,000 and €14,000 for the same property. The EPDM renovation also delivers a superior waterproofing result: the new underlay has a 50+ year service life against the 10–15 years of any bituminous alternative. When building owners present Membriko with the choice between a cheaper short-term fix and a more expensive permanent solution, we present the whole-life cost data and let the arithmetic make the case.

## Solar Panel Integration on EPDM Pitched Roofs

Portugal's solar resource is exceptional. With photovoltaic yields in the south of 1,700 to 1,900 kWh per kWp annually — among the highest in Europe — the case for rooftop solar installation is compelling. But solar panels represent a significant structural and waterproofing intervention in the roof plane. Every mounting fixture that penetrates or loads the roof is a potential waterproofing vulnerability, and every roof surface beneath a panel is shaded from visual inspection. The quality of the waterproofing beneath the panels matters more than the quality of the waterproofing visible from the street, because failures beneath panels are discovered last.

**Mounting systems compatible with EPDM underlays.** Membriko works with rail-mounted and hook-mounted solar installation systems from certified suppliers. The key requirement for pitched roof solar installations over EPDM underlays is that the rafter fixings for mounting rails or hooks must be waterproofed at the EPDM plane, not simply at the tile level. This is achieved through the use of EPDM pipe boot collars at each fixing penetration, bonded to the field membrane with seam tape and liquid EPDM, with the mounting fixture passing through the boot collar after membrane installation and before tile laying. The boot collar accommodates the slight relative movement between the rigid mounting fixture and the elastic membrane without generating stress concentrations.

**Protecting the waterproofing investment.** A 150 m² rooftop photovoltaic installation representing an investment of €15,000 to €25,000 is built on a roof plane whose long-term integrity determines the longevity and ROI of the solar asset. Water ingress beneath a solar panel system does not only damage the building structure — it can compromise the electrical infrastructure of the installation, creating hazardous conditions and voiding manufacturer warranties. Membriko positions EPDM underlay installation as the foundation of any solar investment: a 50-year waterproofing solution that outlasts multiple generations of solar panel technology and protects the mounting infrastructure throughout.

**Planning considerations.** Portuguese planning authorities have progressively simplified the permitting process for rooftop solar installations on residential buildings. However, any alteration that penetrates the waterproofing layer of a classified building or a building in a protected area requires specific authorisation. Membriko advises clients to confirm planning clearance before beginning combined EPDM and solar installation programmes.

**EN 13859-1 compliance.** This European standard specifically governs flexible sheets for waterproofing used as underlays in pitched roof applications. It defines requirements for water resistance, water vapour transmission, mechanical strength, durability, and fire classification. All membranes specified by Membriko for pitched roof underlay applications are EN 13859-1 compliant, with test evidence available to clients on request.

**Fire classification.** Under EN 13501-1, EPDM roofing membranes without additional fire-retardant treatment typically achieve Euroclass E (combustible but low contribution to fire spread). Products with fire-retardant additives can achieve Euroclass D or C. The relevance of fire classification depends on the building type and regulatory requirements: for most residential applications, Euroclass E is acceptable. For buildings subject to DL 220/2008 fire safety requirements, the specifier should confirm the applicable Euroclass requirement.

## Portuguese Standards and Regulations

**RGEU — Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas.** The RGEU is the primary Portuguese regulation governing building construction and safety. For roofing, the RGEU requires that all roofing systems provide adequate protection against water ingress, that pitched roof assemblies covering habitable spaces include adequate ventilation of the roof void, and that minimum drainage provisions are incorporated. EPDM underlay installations by Membriko are designed and documented to comply with all applicable RGEU provisions.

**LNEC documentation and technical approvals.** The Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil (LNEC) is Portugal's national civil engineering laboratory and the principal authority for technical approval of building products in Portugal. LNEC issues Documents of Technical Suitability (Documentos de Homologação, DH) for building products that have been evaluated against Portuguese conditions. Membriko maintains awareness of LNEC DH status for the principal EPDM products it specifies and can provide technical approval documentation as part of project delivery to clients who require it.

**DL 220/2008 — Fire Safety in Buildings.** Decreto-Lei 220/2008 (as amended) establishes fire safety requirements for buildings and building components. For roofing materials, the principal fire safety provisions relate to reaction-to-fire classification of the exposed surface and fire propagation characteristics of the roof assembly. Membriko specifies and installs roofing assemblies in compliance with DL 220/2008 and can provide fire classification documentation for each product used.

**Reduced VAT at 6% — "Construir Portugal" programme.** Under Portugal's "Construir Portugal" housing initiative and existing reduced-rate VAT provisions, renovation works on primary residences may qualify for the reduced VAT rate of 6% (compared to the standard 23%). The criteria for reduced-rate eligibility include that the work must be on an existing building (not new construction), the building must be used primarily as the owner's primary residence, and the work must not include the supply of materials representing more than 50% of the total invoice value. Membriko's project management team advises clients on VAT eligibility at the quotation stage. For qualifying projects, the 6% VAT rate substantially reduces the effective cost of an EPDM renovation programme.

## Common Pitched Roof Waterproofing Mistakes

Membriko's survey team inspects dozens of pitched roof failures annually. The same errors recur with depressing consistency across different building types, different regions, and different contractors. Understanding these errors is the first step to avoiding them.

**Mistake 1: Selecting underlay on price alone.** The price difference between a standard bituminous felt underlay and a quality EPDM underlay is typically €3 to €6 per square metre. On a 150 m² roof, this represents a total difference of €450 to €900 — less than 10% of the typical total re-roofing cost. In exchange for this difference, EPDM provides a service life 3 to 5 times longer than bituminous felt. The arithmetic is not ambiguous: the cheapest underlay produces the highest whole-life cost. Membriko regularly works with building owners who have already replaced a bituminous felt underlay once and are commissioning the EPDM upgrade that should have been specified the first time.

**Mistake 2: Insufficient lap widths.** The minimum horizontal lap width for pitched roof underlays specified in EN 13859-1 is 100 mm for slopes above 15°, increasing to 150 mm for slopes between 10° and 15°. Many installers apply the minimum regardless of actual conditions. On exposed sites, in regions with high rainfall intensity, or where the tile system has significant gap openings, laps of 150 mm should be the minimum for all slopes. Membriko specifies 150 mm as its standard minimum, increasing to 200 mm in exposed coastal or mountain locations.

**Mistake 3: No singular point treatment at ridges and hips.** The ridge and hip apexes are the highest points of the roof: wind speeds are greatest there, tiles are most exposed to wind uplift, and the membrane laps — two sheets meeting at the apex — are under the greatest mechanical challenge. Installers who rely on the tile covering alone to protect the ridge and hip apex are relying on the system's weakest point for protection of its most exposed location. Membriko's singular point protocol for ridges and hips is mandatory, not optional.

**Mistake 4: Chimney counterflashing bedded into mortar rather than mechanically fixed.** Surface-bonded counterflashings rely on the bond between the flashing material and the mortar joint — a bond that degrades as the mortar weathers and carbonates. Mechanically fixed counterflashings, driven into a raked-out mortar joint and pointed over, maintain their waterproofing function regardless of mortar weathering. Membriko specifies mechanical fixing for all counterflashings.

**Mistake 5: Installing non-breathable membrane in inhabited buildings.** Fitting a non-breathable EPDM or bituminous underlay in a roof covering a heated and humidified interior creates the conditions for chronic condensation damage. This error is especially common in renovation work where the installer specifies whichever product is available rather than assessing the specific vapour management requirements of the building. Membriko's survey protocol always identifies habitation status and specifies breathable or non-breathable product accordingly.

**Mistake 6: Failing to remove degraded existing underlay before EPDM installation.** Overing a new EPDM membrane over an existing bituminous felt that is approaching the end of its service life is a false economy. The existing underlay will continue to degrade, eventually developing voids and tears that allow moisture to migrate beneath the EPDM. The EPDM, bonded or mechanically fixed over the degraded substrate, cannot bridge these failures. Full removal is the only correct approach.

**Mistake 7: Inadequate eave protection.** The eave is the lowest point of the roof slope and receives the highest concentration of water flow — all the rainfall collected by the full roof slope passes across the eave in the final moments before entering the gutter. An inadequate eave drip detail allows water to travel back along the underside of the tile and batten by capillary action, wetting the fascia board and the wall plate timber. Membriko's eave detail — a 50 mm membrane overhang directed by a stainless-steel drip profile — eliminates this failure mode.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can EPDM underlay be installed on any pitch angle, or are there limitations?**

EPDM membrane is flexible enough to be installed on any pitch angle from near-horizontal to vertical, and Membriko has installed EPDM underlay on pitched roofs ranging from 7° to 60°. The relevant limitation is not the membrane but the tile system above it: most Portuguese tile types have minimum pitch requirements (Telha Lusa typically 25°, Marselha 17°–20°, Canudo 25°–30°) set by the tile manufacturer based on the rainfall conditions in which the tile can reliably shed water. At pitches below the tile manufacturer's minimum, Membriko recommends discussing alternative tile types or alternative roof cladding materials with the architect before proceeding.

**How does EPDM underlay perform during construction, before the tiles are installed?**

This is a practical question that matters particularly for phased construction projects or renovation projects that may experience weather events between underlay installation and tile completion. EPDM is UV-stable and can be left exposed for extended periods without deterioration — in contrast to bituminous felt, which degrades rapidly when left exposed to summer sun for more than a few weeks. Membriko's EPDM underlays can be left exposed for up to 12 months without compromising performance, though Membriko recommends tiling within 8 weeks where possible to protect the membrane from mechanical damage during construction traffic.

**Will EPDM underlay affect the thermal performance of the roof assembly?**

EPDM membranes are extremely thin (1.0 to 1.5 mm) and have negligible thermal resistance in their own right — adding an EPDM underlay does not measurably change the U-value of the roof assembly. The thermal performance of the roof assembly is determined by the insulation layer, which is typically installed at ceiling level (between joists) or within the rafter depth. Membriko's breathable underlay specification supports ventilated cold-roof assemblies in which insulation is at ceiling level and the roof void above is ventilated — the most common configuration in Portuguese residential construction.

**Is EPDM underlay suitable for roofs that experience snow loading?**

Yes. EPDM's service temperature range extends to -45°C — far below any temperature Portugal's mountain regions experience — and its elongation capacity accommodates any differential movement generated by snow loading redistribution across the roof structure. Snow loads in Portuguese mountain regions, while significant compared to coastal areas, are substantially lower than the design loads common in Central and Northern European building practice, and EPDM's mechanical properties are more than adequate for these conditions.

**How is EPDM underlay maintained after installation?**

The honest answer is: it essentially is not. EPDM requires no maintenance during its service life under normal conditions. It does not need re-coating, re-treatment, or inspection in the same way that liquid-applied systems or metal flashings do. Membriko recommends that clients have their tile covering inspected every five years to identify and replace any broken or displaced tiles before they can cause damage, but the EPDM underlay itself requires no attention between installation and the end of its service life — which is projected to exceed 50 years.

**What warranty does Membriko provide for pitched roof EPDM installation?**

Membriko provides a 15-year workmanship warranty on all pitched roof EPDM installations, covering any defects in application, seam integrity, singular point treatment, and mechanical fixings. This warranty is supported by the membrane manufacturer's product warranty, which typically provides coverage for membrane defects for 20 years from date of manufacture. Warranty documentation, including photographic records of all critical installation details, is provided to the building owner at project completion.

**Can EPDM underlay be repaired if it is damaged during the building's life?**

Yes, and repair is straightforward. EPDM membranes can be repaired with EPDM patch material bonded with seam tape and liquid EPDM — the same materials used in original installation. Repairs to the underlay are accessed by lifting the tiles in the affected area, making the repair, and relaying the tiles. Because EPDM is compatible with itself regardless of age (unlike some thermoplastics that oxidise and lose bondability over time), a repair made 20 years after the original installation uses the same materials and achieves the same bond quality as the original seaming. Membriko provides emergency repair services with a 48-hour response commitment for existing clients.

**What is the process for getting a Membriko quote for a pitched roof project?**

The process is straightforward. Contact Membriko by telephone or through the website enquiry form with the basic project details: location, roof area (approximate), tile type, building age, and whether the project is renovation or new build. Membriko will arrange an initial site visit — provided at no charge — at which our surveyor conducts a structural assessment, discusses the client's requirements and budget, and prepares a detailed specification and quotation. Quotations are typically delivered within three working days of the site visit and include itemised pricing for all stages of work, the technical specification for all materials, and the warranty terms. There is no obligation to proceed.
