# Pitched Roofs (Telhados Inclinados) — EPDM Research Summary

## Application Context

EPDM on pitched roofs functions primarily as a secondary waterproofing layer — the sub-telha
underlay membrane installed beneath conventional tile or slate coverings. Unlike flat roofs where
EPDM is the primary exposed waterproofing system, on pitched roofs it acts as a fail-safe: it
intercepts any water that penetrates between or under tiles due to wind-driven rain, tile
displacement, condensation or ice formation, and redirects it to the gutter. The tile itself remains
the primary weather shield and visible finish; EPDM provides the engineering guarantee beneath it.

Secondary applications include: full EPDM coverage (without tiles) on industrial, agricultural and
commercial buildings where exposed rubber is cost-effective and aesthetically acceptable; valley
lining, dormer cheek waterproofing, chimney apron flashings and parapet/verge details where the
complexity of tiled junctions makes a continuous flexible membrane the most robust solution.

## Portuguese Tile and Slope Regulations

Portugal's building regulations distinguish three climate exposure zones for pitched roofs, each
with different minimum slope requirements for the most common tile types:

**Zona Protegida (Protected):** Inland areas sheltered from direct Atlantic or Mediterranean
exposure. Lower rainfall intensity and wind speeds allow reduced minimum slopes.

**Zona Normal:** The majority of mainland Portugal, including most urban centres.

**Zona Exposta (Exposed):** Coastal strips within approximately 5 km of the sea, and high-altitude
sites subject to prevailing Atlantic winds. The Algarve coastline, the entire Atlantic coast and
the Serra da Estrela region fall into this category. These zones have the most stringent minimum
slope requirements.

For Telha Lusa (the most widespread residential tile in Portugal), the minimum pitch requirements
are approximately 21% in low-rainfall protected zones, rising to 30% in high-rainfall exposed
zones. When a project's actual roof slope falls below the applicable minimum for its tile type and
climate zone, Portuguese practice requires a secondary waterproofing membrane beneath the tiles.
EPDM is technically superior to the traditional bituminous felt sub-telha for this duty because
of its thermal resilience, long service life and flexibility at low temperatures.

The relevant European product standard for pitched roof underlays is EN 13859-1 (flexible sheets
for waterproofing — underlays for discontinuous roofing). This is distinct from EN 13956, which
covers flat roof systems. EPDM used as a sub-telha must comply with EN 13859-1 requirements
including water penetration resistance, tensile properties, dimensional stability and UV resistance
(for the installation period before tiles are fixed).

## Temperature Performance Under Tiles

Under-tile temperatures on south-facing pitched roofs in southern Portugal — particularly the
Algarve and Alentejo — can reach 80-90°C in peak summer. This is the same challenge faced by
flat roofs, but on pitched roofs there is an additional factor: the enclosed air space between tile
and underlay can amplify heat relative to ambient air temperature.

EPDM's service temperature ceiling of +130°C (continuous) provides comfortable safety margin over
the maximum recorded sub-tile temperatures. Bituminous felt underlays, by contrast, become soft
and may release volatile compounds above 60-70°C; in extreme cases they can deform and shed
granule reinforcement into the gutter system. The Portuguese Algarve market represents the most
thermally demanding sub-telha environment in Western Europe, making EPDM the technically preferred
choice.

At the cold extreme, EPDM remains flexible to -45°C, which is relevant for pitched roofs in the
Serra da Estrela, Trás-os-Montes and Beira Interior, where overnight winter temperatures can
drop to -10°C to -15°C and ice formation between tile courses is a known failure mechanism for
rigid bituminous underlays.

## Breathable and Standard EPDM Variants

Standard EPDM is impermeable to both liquid water and water vapour. For pitched roof applications
where insulation is placed directly below the underlay (warm-roof configuration with batts between
rafters), vapour drive from the interior can cause interstitial condensation if the underlay has
a high vapour resistance. Micro-perforated or otherwise vapour-open EPDM variants address this:
the membrane allows water vapour to diffuse outward while remaining liquid-water-tight.

The selection between impermeable and vapour-open EPDM depends on the roof construction:
- **Cold roof** (uninsulated space between tiles and insulated ceiling below): standard EPDM is
  appropriate as ventilation of the rafter space manages vapour.
- **Warm roof** (insulation filling the rafter space, no ventilated cavity): vapour-open EPDM is
  required to prevent condensation within the insulation layer.
- **Hybrid**: where ventilation provision is partial, a hygrothermal calculation per EN ISO 13788
  (Glaser method) or dynamic simulation should guide the specification.

Limited published vapour transmission rate (SD value) data for breathable EPDM membranes is a
known gap in the literature, with most values supplied by individual manufacturers rather than
independent third-party test reports.

## Compatibility with Portuguese Tile Types

The primary Portuguese tile types and their sub-telha compatibility with EPDM:

- **Telha Lusa** (Portuguese pantile — most common residential tile): EPDM is fully compatible;
  standard batten-over-membrane installation applies.
- **Telha Marselha** (Marseille double-lap tile): same compatibility; the flatter profile and
  higher minimum slope in exposed zones make sub-telha especially important.
- **Telha Romana** (Roman tile — curved interlocking): compatible; often specified with an
  additional ventilated batten layer above the EPDM in warm climates.
- **Ardósia** (slate): EPDM is the premium underlay for slate, as slate roofs are the most
  exposed (steep pitch, no lapping redundancy at side joints on single-lap slates).
- **Fibrocimento / metal sheet** (agricultural/industrial): EPDM can replace the traditional
  bituminous underlay or be used as a standalone covering without tiles.

## Penetrations, Valleys and Flashings

Pitched roofs have a higher density of complex junctions than flat roofs: chimneys, roof windows,
dormer walls, ridge vents, soil pipes, antenna masts, valley gutters and verge flashings. Each
represents a potential ingress point if the sub-telha membrane is not properly detailed.

EPDM's elasticity (elongation ≥300%) and formability make it technically well-suited to these
complex geometries. Pre-moulded EPDM pipe boots accommodate pipe penetrations without cutting
and folding flat sheet. EPDM flashing tape (butyl-bonded EPDM strip) seals the underlay to
vertical masonry surfaces at chimney bases and dormer upstands. Valley liners in EPDM are
typically installed as a wide strip (minimum 600 mm) over a purpose-formed trough before tile
battens are fixed, giving a pre-formed waterproof channel that is both flexible and durable.

The ValkAce and ValkPitched solar mounting systems have been tested for compatibility with EPDM
pitched roof underlays. Where PV panels are added to an existing tiled roof with EPDM sub-telha,
the penetration kits provided by Valk are compatible with EPDM sealing tape, avoiding the need
to strip and re-tile around each mounting foot.

## Lifespan and Warranty Data

Under-tile EPDM operates in a significantly less demanding environment than exposed flat-roof
EPDM: it is protected from direct UV, foot traffic and precipitation impact. The tile provides
mechanical protection against hail and debris. As a result, sub-telha EPDM is expected to
outlast the tile itself — with a documented service life of 30-50+ years, the membrane should
not need replacement when tiles are periodically maintained or replaced (every 20-30 years for
clay tiles). The EPDM underlay can remain in place while individual cracked or displaced tiles
are replaced above it.

Manufacturer warranties for sub-telha EPDM systems vary: Carlisle SynTec offers 25+ years of
field experience data for its pitched-roof EPDM products, with material warranties typically
in the 15-30 year range for underlays. The Carlisle Sure-White reflective EPDM (SRI of 87) is
relevant for visible or partially exposed applications such as monopitch industrial roofs where
heat gain reduction is a design goal.

## Market and Sustainability Context

Portugal's construction market is in a growth phase: building permits increased by approximately
14% year-on-year in 2025, driven partly by the "Construir Portugal" government housing programme
which provides a 6% reduced VAT rate for qualifying residential construction. Roof renovation
and re-waterproofing projects represent a significant share of this growth, as Portugal's housing
stock — much of it built between 1960 and 1990 with bituminous felt or asbestos-cement roof
materials — reaches the end of its first major maintenance cycle.

The Portuguese EPDM waterproofing market was estimated at approximately €152 million in 2024,
with average installed costs around €35/m². Bituminous felt remains the volume-dominant
competitor for sub-telha underlays due to lower upfront cost, but typical felt lifespan of
10-15 years versus EPDM's 30-50+ years results in a markedly inferior total cost of ownership,
particularly in renovation scenarios where re-tiling to replace a failed underlay is expensive.

EPDM is 100% recyclable at end of life. Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) are available
from major manufacturers including Carlisle and Elevate. For projects targeting BREEAM or LEED
certification, the availability of EPDs and the long service life (which reduces replacement-cycle
embedded carbon) make EPDM preferable to felt or bituminous alternatives.

## Research Gaps

No peer-reviewed Mediterranean-specific study on EPDM as a pitched-roof underlay exists as of
early 2026. Portuguese building regulations (RGEU and tile installation guidance) reference the
sub-telha requirement but do not prescribe EPDM specifically — they allow any membrane meeting
the applicable EN 13859-1 performance class. Independent vapour transmission rate data for
breathable EPDM variants is limited, with manufacturers providing proprietary test results rather
than third-party verified SD values. These gaps represent opportunities for Membriko to publish
original technical guidance positioned as a market authority resource.
