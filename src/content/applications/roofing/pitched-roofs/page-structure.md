# Pitched Roofs (Telhados Inclinados) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Pitched roofs is use case #2 for Membriko. Where the flat-roofs page is the flagship authority page
targeting engineers, specifiers and commercial clients, the pitched-roofs page must also convert a
large residential audience: homeowners renovating clay-tile roofs, architects specifying sub-telha
for new-build houses, and agricultural/industrial building owners seeking a tile-free EPDM solution.

The emotional hook here is different from flat roofs. Homeowners with pitched roofs are not
typically thinking about waterproofing at all — until they find a damp patch on a ceiling or
discover a cracked tile during a hailstorm. The page must meet readers at the moment of discovery
(something is wrong with my roof) rather than the moment of specification (I need to choose a
membrane). The persuasion arc accordingly starts with the hidden vulnerability concept, not with
material science.

The structure is intentionally distinct from flat roofs:
1. Relatability — homeowner-level problem framing, not engineering problem framing
2. Portugal context first — climate zones and tile regulations before material properties
3. Renovation vs. new build — the renovation path is more emotionally urgent
4. Tile compatibility — homeowners ask "will this work with my tiles?" before anything else
5. Breathability — a concern unique to pitched roofs; absent from the flat-roofs page
6. Detailing — chimneys, valleys and dormers are where pitched roofs actually fail
7. Material science (later in the arc, once trust is established)
8. Installation process — how the work is done without the homeowner needing to vacate
9. Lifespan comparison — contextualised to the tiling maintenance cycle, not ROI indices
10. Before/after renovation stories — social proof for the residential audience
11. Solar integration — growing relevance in the Portuguese residential market
12. Compliance — the slope and sub-telha regulatory requirement as a closing authority signal
13. Conversion — adapted CTA copy for residential rather than commercial context
14. FAQ — entirely distinct questions from flat-roofs, focused on tile, condensation, renovation

---

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Create recognition and relatability for homeowners; establish the "hidden threat"
framing that makes sub-telha EPDM feel necessary rather than optional.

**Content:**
- Headline: "O Telhado da Sua Casa Tem Segunda Linha de Defesa?" (Does your home's roof have
  a second line of defence?) — conversational, residential register, leads with a question
- Sub-headline: Explain that tiles alone are not waterproof — they are weather-resistant cladding,
  and the sub-telha membrane beneath them is the true waterproofing layer. EPDM lasts 30-50+ years,
  compared to 10-15 years for traditional bituminous felt.
- Three stat blocks: 30-50 anos de vida útil / -45°C a +130°C / Compatível com todas as telhas
  portuguesas (3 stats, not 4 — simpler than flat-roofs hero)
- CTA: "Pedir Avaliação Gratuita" (primary) + "Ver Tipos de Aplicação" anchor (secondary)
- Background: Aerial or close-up photo of Portuguese terracotta tile roof — recognisable,
  aspirational residential quality. EPDM underlay visible at a partially lifted tile detail.

**Design note:** Font and tone should feel slightly more approachable than the flat-roofs page.
This is a homeowner page as much as a technical page. Use warm terracotta accent colours to mirror
the tile imagery.

## Section 2: The Hidden Risk — Why Tiles Alone Are Not Waterproofing

**Purpose:** Establish the core educational premise: tiles are cladding, not waterproofing. This
section must be understood by a non-technical homeowner before anything else can land.

**Content:**
Three facts presented as short, clear cards:

1. **Tiles Are Discontinuous**
   Clay and concrete tiles overlap but do not form a sealed joint. Wind-driven rain, particularly
   in Portugal's coastal zones, can be forced horizontally beneath tile laps at wind speeds above
   60-80 km/h. The water that enters must be intercepted before it reaches the roof structure.

2. **Tiles Crack and Shift**
   A single broken tile creates an open entry point. The sub-telha membrane buys time between
   when a tile breaks and when damage reaches the ceiling — days or weeks, not hours. Without
   it, one storm can damage insulation and ceiling finishes.

3. **Condensation Forms Under Tiles**
   Warm humid air rising from living spaces condenses on the underside of cold tiles in winter.
   Without a vapour-managing underlay, this condensation wets timber rafters and purlins,
   promoting rot that is invisible until structural failure occurs.

**Visual:** Three illustrated cross-section diagrams, each showing a different failure path through
a tile-only roof. Simple line art, not photographs. Homeowner-legible without technical knowledge.

## Section 3: Portugal's Climate Zones and Sub-Telha Requirements

**Purpose:** Establish local regulatory and climatic relevance. Show that sub-telha is not optional
in many Portuguese installations — it is required or technically necessary.

**Content:**

**The Three Exposure Zones** explained visually on a Portugal map:

1. **Zona Protegida** — Inland sheltered valleys, eastern Alentejo interior, upper Douro. Minimum
   slopes for Telha Lusa: approximately 21%. Sub-telha recommended; in some configurations
   not mandatory if slope exceeds minimum.

2. **Zona Normal** — Most of mainland Portugal, including greater Lisboa, Porto, Coimbra,
   Évora. Standard slope requirements apply. Sub-telha strongly recommended under EN 13859-1
   for all slopes below 30%.

3. **Zona Exposta** — Within approximately 5 km of the Atlantic or Mediterranean coastline,
   all Algarve, Serra da Estrela above 600 m altitude. Minimum slopes for Telha Lusa rise to
   approximately 30%. Sub-telha is effectively mandatory at any slope that allows coastal
   construction. Exposure classification governed by LNEC guidance and NP EN 13859-1.

**Regulatory call-out:** When a roof's actual pitch falls below the applicable minimum for its tile
type and climate zone, Portuguese building practice requires a secondary waterproofing layer. EPDM
sub-telha is the premium specification for this duty.

**Under-tile temperature note:** South-facing Algarve roofs can reach 80-90°C under tiles in
August. Bituminous felt underlays soften at these temperatures. EPDM handles up to +130°C
continuously with no deformation.

**Visual:** Portugal map with three climate zones highlighted in different tones. Pop-up or
call-out showing minimum slope requirements per tile type per zone in a small table.

## Section 4: Portuguese Tile Types — Full Compatibility Guide

**Purpose:** Directly answer the homeowner's first practical question: "Will this work with my
tiles?" This section converts browse-intent readers into engaged prospects.

**Content:** Five tile types as illustrated cards, each showing a tile profile sketch and a
compatibility statement:

1. **Telha Lusa** (Portuguese Pantile)
   Portugal's most common residential tile. S-shaped clay profile. Standard batten-and-membrane
   installation. EPDM underlay fixed to rafters, battens fixed through membrane, tiles hung on
   battens. Full compatibility — no modification required.

2. **Telha Marselha** (Marseille Tile)
   Double-lap interlocking clay tile. Flatter profile, higher minimum slopes in exposed zones.
   EPDM underlay is especially important for Marselha in coastal zones where minimum slopes are
   frequently borderline. Full compatibility.

3. **Telha Romana** (Roman Tile)
   Curved interlocking profile. Often installed with an additional ventilated counter-batten layer
   above the EPDM to allow sub-tile air movement. EPDM compatible; warm-roof hygrothermal
   assessment recommended.

4. **Ardósia** (Slate)
   Single-lap fixed slate. High-pitch, fully exposed installation — the most demanding sub-telha
   environment. EPDM is the premium underlay specification for slate: its flexibility accommodates
   the movement of individual slates, and its durability matches the slate's own 50-100 year
   service life.

5. **Chapa Metálica / Fibrocimento** (Metal or Fibre-Cement Sheet)
   Agricultural, industrial and commercial buildings. EPDM can be installed as the primary
   exposed waterproofing layer (no tiles required) for monopitch and low-pitch structures.
   Full EPDM covering without cladding — the simplest possible pitched-roof application.

**Visual:** Illustrated tile profile cards in a grid. Each card: tile sketch + tile name in PT/EN +
"EPDM: Compatível" badge. Accessible and scannable.

## Section 5: Renovation vs. New Build — Two Different Projects

**Purpose:** Acknowledge that these two audiences have fundamentally different concerns and
workflows. Do not make renovation customers feel lost on a new-build page.

**Content:** Two-column layout with clear visual separation.

**Renovação (Renovation)**
The existing tile roof has a failed or absent underlay. The renovation path involves either:
- **Parcial (preferred):** Lift tiles in sections, remove failed felt, install EPDM underlay and
  re-fix original tiles. No new tiles required if tiles are undamaged. Works are done section by
  section so the structure is never fully exposed simultaneously.
- **Total:** Full tile strip, EPDM installation across entire roof, re-tile with new or salvaged
  tiles. Required when tiles are past end of life or when structural timber needs treatment.

For most Portuguese residential renovations, the partial approach allows the family to remain in
the house throughout. Membriko crews coordinate tile removal and EPDM installation in bays
typically 3-4 m wide, completing one bay before opening the next.

**Nova Construção (New Build)**
Sub-telha is specified at the design stage and coordinated with the rafter/purlin structure.
Standard sequence:
1. Rafter/purlin installation by carpenter
2. EPDM underlay laid from eaves to ridge (parallel runs, lapped minimum 150 mm at horizontal
   joints, 200 mm at vertical joints)
3. Counter-battens fixed through EPDM into rafters (sealing gasket under each counter-batten)
4. Tile battens fixed to counter-battens
5. Tiles hung and pointed by tiler

Membriko coordinates with the roofing carpenter and tiler; the EPDM installation typically takes
1-3 days for a standard residential roof before tile-laying begins.

**Visual:** Two-column card layout with distinct visual treatments: renovation card uses a
"before" tile-stripped roof photograph; new-build card uses a clean construction sequence diagram.

## Section 6: Controlling Condensation — Breathable vs. Standard EPDM

**Purpose:** Answer the technical concern unique to pitched roofs that does not arise on flat roofs:
vapour management and condensation risk. This is the section that differentiates Membriko from
installers who apply the same membrane without thought for the construction type.

**Content:**

**Why Condensation Matters on Pitched Roofs**
Warm humid interior air rises into the roof space. When it contacts cold surfaces (underlay,
rafters, tiles) in winter, it condenses. Over months and years, repeated condensation wetting
causes timber rot, metal fastener corrosion, and insulation saturation that reduces thermal
performance and promotes mould.

**Two Roof Configurations Require Different Solutions**

1. **Telhado Frio (Cold Roof)** — Insulation is at ceiling level below a ventilated roof space.
   Air circulates freely above the insulation, carrying moisture out through ridge and eave
   vents. Standard impermeable EPDM is appropriate here: it keeps liquid water out, and
   ventilation manages vapour below it.

2. **Telhado Quente (Warm Roof)** — Insulation fills the rafter space (between and/or above
   rafters), with no ventilated cavity. Interior vapour has nowhere to go. Vapour-open (breathable)
   EPDM is required: micro-perforations or diffusion-open structure allows vapour to pass
   through the membrane and escape via the tile course, while remaining liquid-water-tight.

**Specification note:** Membriko conducts a hygrothermal assessment (Glaser method per EN ISO 13788
or dynamic simulation for complex cases) before specifying the membrane variant. The wrong
specification — impermeable EPDM in a warm-roof without adequate ventilation — is a common and
costly error in the Portuguese market.

**Visual:** Two annotated cross-section diagrams: one showing a cold roof with impermeable EPDM
and ventilation arrows; one showing a warm roof with breathable EPDM and vapour diffusion arrows.

## Section 7: Singular Points — Where Pitched Roofs Actually Fail

**Purpose:** Demonstrate deep detailing expertise. The junctions — chimneys, valleys, dormers,
roof windows — are where 80% of pitched roof leaks originate. This section builds technical
credibility without overwhelming the homeowner.

**Content:** Six singular points presented as expandable accordion items or illustrated cards:

1. **Caleiras (Valleys)**
   Where two roof slopes meet, water concentrates. EPDM valley liners (minimum 600 mm wide strip)
   are installed over a pre-formed trough before battens and tiles. The EPDM conforms to the
   valley geometry and remains flexible through thermal movement. Joints, if required, are lapped
   minimum 150 mm and sealed with self-adhesive EPDM tape.

2. **Chaminés (Chimneys)**
   Chimney bases are the single most common source of pitched roof leaks in Portugal. EPDM is
   dressed up the masonry face (minimum 150 mm), folded under the flaunching mortar and secured
   with EPDM flashing tape and a mechanically fixed termination bar. Pre-cut corner patches in
   EPDM avoid the weakest point of traditional lead or mortar aprons.

3. **Clarabóias e Janelas de Telhado (Roof Windows and Skylights)**
   Velux and equivalent roof window frames require an EPDM apron and side flashings integrated
   into the underlay. Pre-formed EPDM flashing kits are available for major roof window brands;
   where custom flashing is required, Membriko fabricates from flat EPDM sheet.

4. **Rincões e Empenas (Dormer Walls and Gable Cheeks)**
   Vertical walls rising from the pitched roof plane require EPDM to be dressed up the wall face
   and behind the wall cladding or render. Minimum upstand 200 mm above the adjacent tile surface.
   EPDM is bonded to the masonry with appropriate primer and contact adhesive; a mechanical
   termination bar finishes the top edge.

5. **Tubagens e Ventilações (Pipes and Vents)**
   Soil pipes, boiler flues and roof ventilators penetrate the underlay. Pre-moulded EPDM pipe
   boots are pulled over the pipe and bonded to the surrounding underlay with seam adhesive and
   tape. No cutting of the main membrane sheet — the boot is self-contained, eliminating the
   most common failure point of conventional flashing lead or mortar.

6. **Cumeeiras e Remates de Beirado (Ridge and Eave Details)**
   Ridge EPDM is lapped over the top course of tile battens before the ridge tile is bedded.
   At the eave, EPDM is turned over the fascia and into the gutter — creating a continuous
   waterproof connection from the first tile course to the rainwater system.

each singular point. Clicking or hovering each call-out reveals the detail description.

## Section 8: EPDM Material Properties for Pitched Roof Conditions

**Purpose:** Condensed material science, pitched-roof-specific. Shorter and more focused than the
flat-roofs material section — the homeowner audience requires less chemistry and more performance
assurance.

**Content:**

**Why Bituminous Felt Fails Under Tiles**
Traditional bituminous felt (felt 1F and 3G underlays) performs adequately for 10-15 years. Above
60-70°C it softens and can deform; below -10°C it becomes brittle and cracks when tiles settle.
In Portugal's Algarve, Alentejo and Centro regions, both extremes are reached within the same year.
After 15-20 years, felt becomes granular and loses tensile integrity — it tears when tiles are
lifted for maintenance, making replacement necessary at every major roof inspection.

**EPDM Physical Properties — Pitched Roof Specification**
| Property | EPDM Value | EN 13859-1 Minimum | Bitumen Felt (reference) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tensile strength | ≥ 7 N/mm² | Class T1 or T2 per product | 0.5-1.5 N/mm² |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | No minimum for underlays | 5-15% |
| Service temp (low) | -45°C | No EN minimum | -5°C typical |
| Service temp (high) | +130°C | No EN maximum | +70°C max |
| Product standard | EN 13859-1 | EN 13859-1 | EN 13859-1 |
| Projected service life | 30-50+ years | Not specified | 10-15 years |

**Elongation is the key metric for underlays.** A membrane beneath tiles must accommodate:
individual tile movement (3-5 mm per tile across temperature cycles), timber shrinkage and
settlement, and fastener pull-through forces. At 300% elongation, EPDM stretches around
movement without tearing. At 5-15% elongation, bituminous felt tears.

**Visual:** Single clean data table (above). Pull-quote callout: "300% elongation vs. 15%:
EPDM stretches where felt tears." Short, memorable, shareable.

## Section 9: Membriko's Pitched Roof Installation Process

**Purpose:** Make the installation feel manageable, professional and minimally disruptive —
key concerns for residential homeowners who have never had roof work done before.

**Content:** Six-step numbered process, adapted for pitched roofs. Distinct from the flat-roofs
6-step which references flood testing, drainage engineering and structural load checks.

1. **Visita Técnica Gratuita** — Membriko technician visits, inspects current underlay condition
   via endoscope camera under representative tiles (no tile stripping required for diagnosis),
   photographs the singular points (chimney, valleys, verges) and produces a written condition
   report within 48 hours.

2. **Plano de Trabalhos** — Written scope of work specifying: membrane type (breathable or
   standard), installation sequence (bay widths, starting point), singular point detail method
   for each junction on the roof. Client receives this before any work begins.

3. **Preparação** — Tiles are carefully lifted and stacked per bay. Defective tiles are
   identified and flagged for replacement. Timber inspected and treated if signs of moisture
   damage are found. Failed felt or bituminous underlay removed and disposed.

4. **Instalação do EPDM** — Membrane unrolled from eaves to ridge, overlaps lapped and bonded
   with seam tape. Counter-battens and tile battens refixed with gasket-sealed screws. All
   singular points (chimney aprons, valley liners, pipe boots, verge details) fabricated and
   installed before tiles are returned.

5. **Retorno das Telhas** — Original tiles re-hung bay by bay immediately after each EPDM
   section is complete, minimising the period of exposure to weather. Cracked or broken tiles
   replaced with matching stock sourced by Membriko or supplied by the client.

6. **Inspeção e Garantia** — Visual inspection of every seam and singular point. Photographs
   of all completed details provided to client. 20-year installation warranty certificate
   issued. Recommended maintenance schedule (visual tile inspection every 3-5 years) documented.

**Visual:** Numbered vertical timeline. Each step has a site photograph — particularly step 4
showing EPDM being installed between rafters, and step 5 showing tiles being re-hung. Homeowners
want to see the actual work, not diagrams.

## Section 10: Renovation Stories — Before and After

**Purpose:** Social proof adapted for the residential audience. Where commercial clients want
quantitative case studies, homeowners want to see houses like theirs and read about experiences
like theirs.

**Content:** Three renovation vignettes — short, narrative-style, first-person or third-person
residential accounts:

1. **Casa em Óbidos — Renovação Parcial, 180 m²**
   Problem: Damp patches on master bedroom ceiling after each Atlantic storm. 1970s bituminous
   felt completely failed. Original Telha Lusa retained, being in good condition.
   Solution: Partial renovation in 8 bays over 4 days. Family remained in house throughout.
   EPDM sub-telha with chimney apron and valley liner. Result: No infiltration in 3 years since.

2. **Quinta Agrícola no Alentejo — EPDM Completo sem Telhas**
   Problem: Asbestos-cement sheet roof on farm storage building. Sheets cracking, no longer
   permitted for repair due to asbestos regulation. Owner wanted a permanent low-maintenance
   replacement.
   Solution: Full strip of asbestos-cement, EPDM installed as standalone covering over timber
   purlins. No tiles. Reflective EPDM variant to reduce under-roof temperatures. Result:
   Installed 2019, performing without maintenance as of 2026.

3. **Moradia em Cascais — Nova Construção com Solar**
   Problem: Architect specified Telha Romana with south-facing PV integration. Needed a sub-telha
   that was compatible with solar mounting feet without penetrating the membrane.
   Solution: EPDM sub-telha with solar-compatible penetration kits (ValkPitched system) at each
   mounting foot location. Integrated valley liners and roof window flashings. Result: Certified
   for BREEAM Homes compliance; full EPDM system life expected to match 30-year solar panel life.

**Design note:** Each vignette should have a "before" photo and an "after" photo, or at minimum
the after photograph. Use pull-quote format for one key client statement per vignette. Keep the
tone warm and residential — not a formal case study format.

## Section 11: Solar Integration on Pitched EPDM Roofs

**Purpose:** Capture the growing intersection of roof renovation and solar installation in
Portugal. Many homeowners who are having their roof re-waterproofed are also considering solar.
This section positions Membriko to advise on both simultaneously.

**Content:**

**Portugal's Solar Context**
Portugal reached 5.4 GW of installed residential solar capacity by end of 2025. "Autoconsumo"
regulations (DL 153/2014 as amended) allow households to sell excess generation to the grid.
The most cost-effective time to prepare a roof for solar is during a re-waterproofing project —
before tiles are fixed. Coordinating sub-telha and solar mounting installation eliminates a
second tile-stripping operation.

**EPDM and Solar — How It Works**
- Solar mounting feet are fixed to rafters through the EPDM layer.
- Each foot penetration is sealed with a ValkAce or ValkPitched EPDM-compatible gasket and
  sealing boot, bonded to the surrounding sub-telha.
- No tape joints or roof-level wiring pass through the membrane — wiring is routed through the
  ridge or via conduit through the gable.
- The EPDM underlay continues to provide unbroken waterproofing between and around all
  mounting feet for the full system life.

**Thermal note:** Photovoltaic panels create a partial shading effect on the tile surface below
them, reducing sub-tile temperatures by 5-15°C compared to un-shaded sections. This further
reduces thermal stress on the EPDM in the solar-panel zone.

**Service life alignment:** A 30-year EPDM sub-telha and a 25-30 year solar panel system have
compatible service lives, meaning the roof does not need to be stripped again before the panels
require replacement at end of their productive life.

**Visual:** Photograph or diagram of a pitched roof with PV panels, showing how the EPDM
underlay wraps around mounting feet. Detail drawing of one mounting foot penetration with EPDM
gasket.

## Section 12: Regulatory and Standards Compliance

**Purpose:** Authority signal for architects and specifiers. Shorter than the flat-roofs
compliance section but covers the specific standards for pitched roof underlays, which differ
from flat roof standards.

**Content:**

**Pitched Roof Underlay Standard: EN 13859-1**
The European harmonised standard for flexible sheets for waterproofing — underlays for
discontinuous roofing (tiles, slates). Specifies: water penetration resistance under defined
conditions, tensile and elongation properties, dimensional stability, resistance to UV
(during installation period), vapour transmission class (for breathable variants). EPDM sub-telha
products must carry CE marking under this standard for legal sale in Portugal.

**Key distinction from flat roofs:** EN 13859-1 (for pitched roof underlays) differs from
EN 13956 (for flat roof waterproofing sheets). An EN 13956-certified flat roof EPDM is not
automatically compliant for pitched roof underlay use — the product must be specifically tested
and CE-marked under EN 13859-1 for this application.

**Portuguese tile slope regulations**
Minimum slopes by tile type and exposure zone are referenced in LNEC guidance notes and the
manufacturer's installation specifications referenced in the tile CE declaration. Below-minimum
slopes require secondary waterproofing per good practice guidance; EPDM sub-telha meeting
EN 13859-1 Class W1 or W2 water penetration resistance fulfils this requirement.

**Thermal regulation (REH — Regulamento de Desempenho Energético dos Edifícios de Habitação)**
Roof U-value requirements under REH depend on climate zone. For warm-roof configurations where
EPDM underlay is installed directly over insulation, the vapour resistance of the underlay must
be coordinated with the insulation specification to meet condensation risk requirements of
EN ISO 13788.

**Visual:** Standards badge grid: EN 13859-1 / CE marking / LNEC reference / REH. Offer a
downloadable "Conformidade de Sub-Telha EPDM" PDF as a lead magnet for architects and engineers.

---

## Section 13: Contact and Conversion

**Purpose:** Convert the reader who has arrived at the end of the page into an enquiry. The copy
and CTA structure for residential homeowners differs from the commercial flat-roofs close.

**Content:**
- Headline: "O Seu Telhado Merece Mais de 30 Anos de Proteção" (Your roof deserves 30+ years
  of protection) — benefit-forward, not feature-forward
- One paragraph: Membriko offers free technical assessment for all pitched roof projects in
  Portugal. We diagnose your current underlay condition without stripping tiles, specify the
  right membrane for your tile type, climate zone and roof construction, and install with minimal
  disruption to your household.
- Three trust signals below the CTA: "Diagnóstico sem desmonte de telhas" / "Orçamento em 48h" /
  "Garantia de 20 anos por escrito"
- Primary CTA: "Pedir Avaliação Gratuita" (form or phone click-to-call)
- Secondary CTA: "Falar com Técnico por WhatsApp" (residential clients frequently prefer
  WhatsApp contact — reflects real Portuguese consumer behaviour)

**Design note:** This conversion section should feel warmer and less corporate than the flat-roofs
conversion block. Consider a background with the terracotta tile image from the hero, creating
visual bookending.

---

## Section 14: FAQ — Pitched Roofs

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search queries specific to pitched roof and sub-telha. Eight
questions that do not overlap with the flat-roofs FAQ.

**Entirely distinct from flat-roofs FAQ — eight unique questions:**

1. **O meu telhado tem telha Lusa — preciso mesmo de sub-telha?**
   Not always — but more often than most homeowners assume. If your roof is in a coastal zone
   (Zona Exposta) and/or the pitch is below 30%, a secondary waterproofing layer is recommended
   by Portuguese construction practice and the tile manufacturer's installation guide. If your
   roof is inland and steeply pitched (above 30%), you may technically be within the minimum,
   but sub-telha still provides insurance against tile displacement, storm damage and condensation.
   A free Membriko inspection determines your specific situation.

2. **A membrana EPDM sub-telha vai durar mais do que as minhas telhas?**
   Yes — this is one of EPDM's key advantages over traditional felt. Clay tiles have a service
   life of 30-60 years depending on quality and exposure; EPDM sub-telha lasts 30-50+ years.
   When tiles need maintenance or replacement, the EPDM underlay can remain in place — it does
   not need to be stripped out with the tiles. This means you pay for the sub-telha once, not
   twice.

3. **A instalação do EPDM obriga a que a família saia de casa?**
   No. Membriko installs in bays (sections) typically 3-4 m wide. Each bay is opened, the
   EPDM installed and the tiles returned before the next bay is opened. The structure is never
   fully exposed at once. Work is paused if rain is forecast. In practice, the vast majority of
   residential renovations are completed without the family needing to vacate.

4. **O EPDM sub-telha é visível do exterior?**
   No. Once tiles are re-hung, the EPDM is completely invisible. It is hidden beneath the tile
   battens, counter-battens and tiles. The only visible evidence of a Membriko installation is
   the improved chimney apron and valley detail — which typically looks cleaner and more
   finished than the original lead or mortar work.

5. **Posso instalar painéis solares num telhado com EPDM sub-telha?**
   Yes. Solar mounting feet are fixed to the rafters through the EPDM, with each penetration
   sealed using a purpose-made EPDM gasket kit. Systems from Valk (ValkPitched), K2 and IronRidge
   have been tested with EPDM underlays. The best time to install sub-telha is at the same time
   as solar mounting, so that both are coordinated before tiles go back on. Membriko works
   directly with solar installers to coordinate timing.

6. **Qual é a diferença entre EPDM respirável e standard para telhados inclinados?**
   Standard EPDM is impermeable to both water and water vapour. Breathable (vapour-open) EPDM
   allows water vapour to diffuse through it while still blocking liquid water. For a cold roof
   (insulation at ceiling level, ventilated roof space), standard EPDM is correct. For a warm
   roof (insulation filling the rafter space, no ventilated cavity), breathable EPDM is required
   to prevent interstitial condensation that would damage timber and insulation. Membriko
   specifies the correct variant based on your roof's construction — do not assume one size fits
   all.

7. **O EPDM funciona em telhados com muita inclinação (acima de 45°)?**
   Yes. There is no maximum slope for EPDM sub-telha. Steep pitches (45°+) are actually easier
   to waterproof because water drains rapidly and ponding is not a concern. The membrane is
   mechanically fixed (via counter-battens and battens) so there is no risk of slippage even
   on very steep pitches. Membriko has experience on slate and tile roofs with pitches up to 60°.

8. **Quanto tempo dura a instalação numa moradia típica?**
   A typical residential roof of 150-200 m² takes 3-5 working days for EPDM sub-telha
   installation, including tile removal, EPDM laying, all singular point detailing and tile
   refixing. Roofs with complex junctions (multiple chimneys, dormers, roof windows) take
   longer. Membriko provides a day-by-day programme with the written quotation so there are
   no surprises.
