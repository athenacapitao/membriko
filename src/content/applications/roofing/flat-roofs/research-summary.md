# Flat Roofs — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM Fundamentals for Flat Roofs

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is a synthetic rubber membrane produced through the
vulcanisation of ethylene, propylene and a diene monomer (typically ENB — ethylidene norbornene).
The saturated backbone of the polymer chain is what gives EPDM its defining properties: the
carbon-to-carbon bonds along the main chain are chemically inert to UV radiation and ozone, unlike
the unsaturated double bonds found in natural rubber or SBS bitumen.

Key physical properties:
- Service temperature range: -45°C to +150°C (continuous); peaks to +150°C briefly
- Elongation at break: 300-400% (typical production; EN 12311-2 minimum 300%)
- Tensile strength: 9-12 N/mm² depending on formulation
- Water absorption: < 1% by weight (ASTM D471)
- UV resistance: no degradation without protective coatings — intrinsic to the chemistry
- Product standard compliance: EN 13956 (European) and ASTM D4637 (North American)

Carbon black (typically 25-35 phr) reinforces the matrix against mechanical stress and further
enhances UV absorption, converting photon energy to heat rather than allowing chain scission. ENB
provides the unsaturation sites needed for sulphur vulcanisation while keeping them off the main
chain — a critical distinction from SBS polymers.

## Key Field Studies

### ERA 30-Year Field Study (USA)

The EPDM Roofing Association commissioned an independent assessment of five commercial
installations aged 28-32 years at the time of sampling. Core samples were extracted and tested
against current ASTM D4637 requirements for tensile strength, elongation at break and cold-bend
flexibility. All five roofs exceeded the minimums, with elongation values between 180-240% (reduced
from original values but still well above the 100% minimum for aged membranes). No delamination,
oxidative cracking or plasticiser migration was detected. This study is the most cited field-
evidence document for EPDM longevity in the roofing industry.

### SKZ German Durability Study

The SKZ (Suddeutsches Kunststoff-Zentrum) tested 39 EPDM roof membrane samples from operational
European installations representing diverse climates and installation methods. Oxidative induction
time (OIT) testing, tensile tests and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were combined
to construct degradation rate models. The projected median service life across all samples exceeded
50 years under Central European exposure conditions. The study noted that early-formula membranes
(pre-1990) showed slightly higher degradation rates due to lower carbon black loading, while
post-1990 production showed markedly slower ageing curves.

## Installation Methods

Three primary installation systems are used for flat roofs:

**Fully Adhered (Bonded):** The membrane is bonded to the substrate across 100% of its surface
using neoprene-based or low-VOC water-based contact adhesive. This eliminates billowing under wind
uplift and is the standard method for roofs in wind-exposed zones or where ponding must be
controlled tightly. Requires a dimensionally stable, clean, dry substrate.

**Mechanically Fastened:** Fastener discs and insulation screws secure overlapping seam zones at
calculated spacing based on wind-load engineering. The field of the membrane is loose. This method
is suited to metal deck substrates or when the structural slab cannot carry the additional dead load
of ballast. Fastener pattern must be engineered to EN 1991-1-4 wind loads.

**Ballasted:** The membrane is laid loose and held down by rounded washed gravel (nominal 50-80
kg/m²) or concrete pavers. It is the fastest and least expensive installation method and allows the
membrane to self-relax during thermal cycling. Restricted to roofs with slope under approximately
5° due to ballast migration risk. The additional dead load (up to 120 kg/m² with pavers) requires
structural verification.

## Portugal Regulatory Context

- **EN 13956 / NP EN 13956**: The harmonised European product standard adopted as the Portuguese
  National Standard (NP EN) specifies the performance characteristics and marking requirements for
  flexible sheets for waterproofing — synthetic polymer sheets (EPDM falls under Type 3).
- **LNEC Documentos de Aplicação (DTA)**: LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) issues
  national technical approvals (Documento de Homologação or DTA) for specific products and systems,
  supplementing CE marking with local climatic validation.
- **RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificações Urbanas)**: Decree-Law 38 382/51 — Article 90 and
  related provisions specify minimum drainage slope of 1% for flat roofs of occupied buildings.
  Industry practice is to specify 2% as a design minimum to account for construction tolerance.
- **SCIE Fire Regulations (DL 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008)**: For covered car parks,
  commercial premises and buildings over a defined utilisation category, the fire reaction class of
  the waterproofing membrane must be considered. EPDM is classified as E under EN 13501-1. For
  categories requiring BROOF(t4), an additional mineral ballast or protection layer is specified.

## Innovations

- **Elevate (formerly Firestone) RubberGard SA**: A self-adhered EPDM variant featuring a factory-
  applied butyl adhesive layer protected by a release film. Eliminates the adhesive spread and
  flash-off wait time, reducing labour by approximately 77% versus solvent-based bonding adhesive on
  large fields. Particularly relevant for Portugal given summer humidity and temperature constraints
  on solvent adhesive application windows.
- **Carlisle SynTec 90-mil EPDM with 40-Year Warranty**: High-thickness (2.3 mm) single-ply system
  supplied with a manufacturer's material and workmanship warranty of 40 years — the longest in the
  single-ply market. Typically specified for critical infrastructure such as hospitals and data
  centres.
- **Drone Thermal Inspection**: Infrared thermography from UAV platforms allows detection of
  subsurface moisture trapped below the membrane without invasive probing. Cost-effective for areas
  above 1,000 m². Becoming standard practice for post-storm inspection in the Portuguese market.
- **Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs)**: Leading EPDM manufacturers now publish
  ISO 14025-compliant EPDs quantifying embodied carbon, water use and waste. Relevant to BREEAM-
  Portugal and LEED-certified projects requiring materials documentation.

## EPDM vs Key Competitors

| System | Proven Life | Key Weakness vs EPDM |
|---|---|---|
| TPO | 10-20 years field data | Seam heat-weld reliability; UV degradation of seam adhesive |
| PVC | 20-30 years | Plasticiser migration → brittleness; chlorine content; incompatible with bitumen |
| SBS/APP Bitumen | 15-25 years | Torch installation fire risk; surface oxidation without topcoat; 2-layer systems |
| Liquid PU | 10-15 years | Requires recoating every 5-10 years; substrate prep sensitivity |

## Research Gap

No peer-reviewed Mediterranean-specific EPDM field study has been published as of 2025. All
long-term durability projections for Portugal are extrapolated from Central European and North
American field data where solar irradiance (GHI) is 10-25% lower than in southern Portugal
(Algarve GHI approximately 1,900-2,100 kWh/m²/year vs. Germany at 1,000-1,100 kWh/m²/year). The
conservative interpretation is that stated 50-year projections should be verified with Mediterranean
field evidence; the optimistic interpretation is that the already-slow degradation rates measured in
high-irradiance US climates (Texas, Arizona) suggest EPDM is robust even under higher UV loads. The
Membriko technical position is that 50-year service life is defensible for Portugal given US
southern-climate data, while acknowledging this extrapolation.
