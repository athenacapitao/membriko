# Flat Roofs — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Flat roofs is use case #1 for Membriko and should function as the flagship authority page for the
entire site. The page must accomplish three things simultaneously: establish technical credibility
with engineers and specifiers, convert building owners searching for a waterproofing contractor,
and rank for both Portuguese-language and English-language commercial search terms. The structure
is intentionally heavier on science and data than subsequent use-case pages — this is deliberate
positioning. When a reader finishes this page, they should understand EPDM better than any
competitor's page has ever explained it, and they should have no remaining reason to seek a second
opinion before contacting Membriko.

The section order follows a deliberate persuasion arc:
1. Stakes — why this matters (emotional hook)
2. Problem diagnosis — establish the reader's pain and our understanding of it
3. Material science — the deepest credibility signal on the site
4. Proof data — quantitative backup for claims
5. How-to — practical confidence that we know what we're doing
6. Our process — de-risk the purchase decision
7. Local relevance — Portugal-specific adaptation
8. Comparison — handle the alternatives objection
9. Innovation — future-proof the decision
10. Compliance — eliminate regulatory doubt
11. Failure modes — pre-empt "what could go wrong"
12. ROI — justify the investment rationally
13. Close — conversion
14. FAQ — capture long-tail search, reduce pre-sale queries

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Create urgency and establish stakes before any product mention.

**Content:**
- Headline: "Coberturas Planas: o Maior Desafio de Impermeabilização em Portugal" (Flat roofs are
  Portugal's #1 waterproofing failure point — approximately 40% of all reported waterproofing
  failures in residential construction involve flat or low-slope roofs)
- Sub-headline: One sentence on EPDM as the engineering answer, with the 50-year service life as
  the single most compelling proof point
- Four stat blocks: 50+ years proven life / -45°C to +150°C range / 300-400% elongation /
  20-year Membriko installation warranty
- CTA: "Solicitar Diagnóstico Gratuito" (primary) + "Ver Dados Técnicos" anchor link (secondary)
- Background: High-quality aerial or close-up photograph of a completed EPDM flat roof

**Design note:** Stats should be visually prominent — large numeric + small label. This is the
only hero on the site with four stats; other pages use three.

---

## Section 2: The Science — Why Flat Roofs Fail

**Purpose:** Show we understand the engineering problem before we present the solution.

**Content:**
Three failure mechanisms with technical explanation:

1. **Ponding Water (Acumulação de Água)**
   - Flat roofs with inadequate slope (< 1% is non-compliant per RGEU Art. 90) accumulate standing
     water. Water weight adds 10 kg/m² per centimetre depth. Over time, ponding accelerates UV
     degradation of membrane surfaces and promotes biological growth. Most bituminous systems are
     not designed for permanent immersion.

2. **Thermal Cycling Fatigue (Fadiga por Ciclos Térmicos)**
   - Portugal's rooftop surfaces reach 80-90°C in summer and drop to near 0°C on winter nights in
     inland regions. A 10 m run of membrane undergoes approximately 12-15 mm of thermal movement
     over this range. Rigid or semi-rigid systems crack at seams and penetrations first.

3. **UV and Ozone Degradation (Degradação UV e Ozono)**
   - Portugal receives 2,500-3,000 hours of sunshine annually (vs. UK at ~1,400 hours). Polymers
     with unsaturated backbone bonds — particularly SBS and APP bitumen — undergo chain scission and
     surface oxidation over 10-15 years. Membranes become brittle and lose elongation capacity.

**Visual:** Annotated diagram or icon grid with the three failure modes. Before/after photos of
bituminous membrane failure (cracking, blistering, bubbling).

---

## Section 3: EPDM — The Material

**Purpose:** Technical authority. This section should be the most detailed material science
explanation any EPDM contractor has published in Portugal.

**Content:**

**Polymer Chemistry (brief, accessible)**
- EPDM = Ethylene (E) + Propylene (P) + Diene Monomer (D) — specifically ENB (ethylidene
  norbornene) as the termonomer
- The saturated carbon-carbon backbone is chemically inert to UV photons and ozone molecules —
  this is not a coating effect, it is intrinsic to the molecular structure
- Contrast with SBS bitumen: the styrene-butadiene-styrene block has unsaturated double bonds on
  the main chain — exactly where UV and ozone attack
- Carbon black (25-35 phr) reinforces the matrix and converts UV energy to heat rather than
  allowing photon-induced chain scission

**Physical Properties Table**
| Property | Value | Test Method |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness range | 1.0 / 1.2 / 1.5 / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | — |
| Reaction to fire | Class E | EN 13501-1 |
| Water absorption | < 1% | ASTM D471 |
| Resistance to ozone | No cracking at 100 pphm | EN 1844 |
| Product standard | EN 13956 Type 3 | — |

**Visual:** Molecular diagram (simplified) showing the saturated backbone vs. unsaturated
alternatives. Optional microscopy image of EPDM cross-section.

## Section 4: Performance Data

**Purpose:** Quantitative proof. No competitor page in the Portuguese market has cited the ERA or
SKZ studies — this is a direct differentiator.

**Content:**

**ERA 30-Year Field Study**
- 5 roofs, 28-32 years old at time of testing
- All cores exceeded ASTM D4637 aged-membrane minimums
- Elongation retained: 180-240% (minimum 100% for aged EPDM)
- Conclusion: No delamination, oxidation cracking or material failure detected
- Source: EPDM Roofing Association independent field study

**SKZ German Durability Study**
- 39 European EPDM samples tested across multiple installation types
- Methodology: OIT (oxidative induction time), FTIR spectroscopy, tensile testing
- Projected median service life: > 50 years under Central European conditions
- Post-1990 formulations show markedly slower ageing curves due to improved carbon black loading

**EN 13956 Compliance Summary**
- Harmonised European standard under CPR (Construction Products Regulation)
- CE marking mandatory for market access in Portugal
- Key performance characteristics: tensile properties, elongation, tear resistance, cold fold,
  watertightness under pressure, resistance to UV and heat ageing

**Visual:** Bar chart showing ERA study elongation retention vs. ASTM minimums. Call-out boxes for
the two study headlines.

## Section 5: Three Installation Methods

**Purpose:** Demonstrate installation expertise and help specifiers/owners choose the right system.

**Content:** Three cards, each with: name, description, best-for scenario, pros (3 points), cons
(3 points), typical cost range indicator (low/medium/high relative — no absolute figures).

1. **Sistema Colado — Fully Adhered**
   - 100% bonded to substrate with contact adhesive
   - Best for: high wind-uplift zones, roofs where ponding drainage must be precise,
     new-build projects with stable substrates
   - Pros: maximum wind resistance, no sub-membrane water migration, suits irregular substrates
   - Cons: longer install time, substrate must be dry and non-friable, adhesive application
     sensitive to temperature and humidity windows

2. **Sistema de Fixação Mecânica — Mechanically Fastened**
   - Fastener discs at seam overlaps, membrane field is loose
   - Best for: metal deck substrates, lightweight structures, projects where structural dead
     load is constrained
   - Pros: no substrate strength requirement, suitable for steel and timber decks, accessible
     fasteners for future inspection
   - Cons: fasteners are potential weak points, requires wind-load engineering calculation,
     fastener lines visible at seams

3. **Sistema de Lastro — Ballasted**
   - Membrane laid loose, held by 50-80 kg/m² rounded gravel or concrete pavers
   - Best for: large-area flat roofs with structural capacity, budget-sensitive projects,
     green roof or amenity terrace bases
   - Pros: fastest install, easiest future access, membrane self-relaxes during thermal cycling
   - Cons: structural load addition, slope limited to < 5°, ballast migration in extreme wind

**Visual:** Three side-by-side illustrated cross-sections showing each installation method in
schematic form. Substrate / insulation / EPDM / ballast layers clearly labelled.

**Content:** Numbered step timeline with icon per step.

1. **Consultoria e Diagnóstico** — Free technical visit, photographic condition report,
   identification of all singular points (penetrations, upstands, drains, expansion joints)
2. **Projeto de Impermeabilização** — Written specification document, product selection, slope
   verification, drainage design, structural load check for ballasted systems
3. **Preparação do Suporte** — Substrate repair, old membrane removal (if required), priming,
   slope correction screeds if needed
4. **Instalação da Membrana** — Membrane placement and bonding/fastening/ballasting, all
   singular points wrapped and sealed with prefabricated EPDM accessories (corners, pipes,
   drains, upstand flashings)
5. **Controlo de Qualidade** — 100% seam inspection, electronic leak detection or flood test,
   photographic as-built record submitted to client
6. **Garantia e Manutenção** — 20-year installation warranty certificate, annual inspection offer,
   documented maintenance plan delivered with handover

**Visual:** Horizontal stepper component or vertical timeline with icons. Progress indicator.

## Section 7: Portugal Climate Zones

**Purpose:** Local relevance. Show that Membriko understands Portugal's specific challenges, not
generic European guidance.

**Content:** Three climate zones, each with: zone name, key cities, characteristic challenge for
flat roofs, EPDM response.

1. **Litoral Atlântico** (Porto, Lisboa, Setúbal, Aveiro)
   - Challenge: high humidity (75-85% RH average), driving rain from Atlantic depressions,
     moderate but frequent thermal cycling, occasional frost at altitude
   - EPDM response: watertight under permanent exposure; cold-fold performance to -45°C; no
     corrosion or hydrolysis

2. **Mediterrâneo** (Algarve, Alentejo Litoral, Baixo Alentejo)
   - Challenge: rooftop surface temperatures reaching 80-90°C in July-August, GHI of
     1,900-2,100 kWh/m²/year (among the highest in Europe), occasional extreme precipitation
     events in autumn
   - EPDM response: retains elasticity to +150°C; saturated backbone does not degrade under
     high UV; no protective topcoat required

3. **Interior Continental** (Trás-os-Montes, Beira Interior, Alentejo Interior)
   - Challenge: temperature range from -15°C in winter to +40°C ambient (rooftop surface to
     +80°C), snow loads at altitude, dry summer periods alternating with heavy autumn rain
   - EPDM response: maintains flexibility across the full -45°C to +150°C service range; one
     material handles all extremes without seasonal treatment

**Visual:** Map of Portugal with three climate zones highlighted. Small stat callout per zone.

## Section 8: EPDM vs Alternatives

**Purpose:** Address the "but what about..." objection proactively. Framed as objective
comparison, not competitive attack.

**Content:** Comparison table with 6 rows and 5 columns (Feature / EPDM / TPO / PVC / Bitumen APP).

| Feature | EPDM | TPO | PVC | Bitumen APP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proven service life | 50+ years | 10-20 years | 20-30 years | 15-25 years |
| UV resistance | Intrinsic — no degradation | Good but seam risk | Good with plasticisers | Requires surface protection |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +150°C | -40°C to +100°C | -30°C to +60°C | -15°C to +100°C |
| Installation risk | Cold — no flame | Hot air weld | Hot air weld | Gas torch — fire risk |
| End-of-life | 100% recyclable | Recyclable | Chlorine content | Difficult to recycle |
| 30-year TCO | Lowest | Medium | Medium-high | Highest |

Below table: short honest paragraph acknowledging TPO's cost advantages in certain contexts and
PVC's track record in controlled environments — this increases credibility.

**Visual:** Colour-coded comparison table. EPDM column highlighted. Footnote with data sources.

## Section 9: Innovation and Technology

**Purpose:** Establish Membriko as forward-looking, not a commodity installer.

**Content:** Four innovation topics as cards or list:

1. **Self-Adhered EPDM Systems (SA)**
   - Elevate RubberGard SA: factory-applied butyl adhesive layer, release film removed on site
   - Eliminates adhesive spread and flash-off wait time
   - 77% labour reduction on large field areas vs. solvent bonding adhesive
   - Particularly valuable in Portuguese summer when solvent adhesive application windows are
     narrow (high temperature, humidity conditions)

2. **Extended Manufacturer Warranties**
   - Carlisle SynTec 90-mil (2.3 mm) system: 40-year manufacturer warranty — longest in the
     single-ply market
   - Relevant for critical infrastructure: hospitals, data centres, logistics hubs

3. **Drone Thermal Inspection**
   - Infrared UAV survey detects trapped moisture beneath the membrane (wet insulation shows as
     warm anomaly in evening thermography)
   - Non-invasive, no core drilling required for pre-purchase due diligence or post-storm
     assessment
   - Cost-effective for areas above 500 m²
   - Membriko offers pre-installation and post-installation drone surveys on request

4. **Green Roof and IoT Integration**
   - EPDM is the root-resistant base membrane for all Membriko green roof systems (FLL-certified
     root-resistance test, EN 13948)
   - Smart drainage sensors and soil moisture monitors can be embedded at installation to provide
     live roof performance data via web dashboard
   - Relevant for BREEAM-Portugal "Wat 02" credit (rainwater management) and "Mat 05" credit
     (responsible sourcing)

**Visual:** Icon cards per innovation. Photograph of drone inspection in progress (if available).

## Section 10: Regulatory Framework

**Purpose:** Eliminate doubt for specifiers, architects and public-sector clients about compliance.

**Content:**

**European Level**
- EN 13956: Flexible sheets for waterproofing — synthetic polymer sheets. Specifies requirements
  for EPDM (Type 3) and other polymeric membranes. CE marking mandatory under CPR for all
  products sold in Portugal.
- ETAG 006 (now EAD 030004-00-0402): European Assessment Document for kits for liquid applied
  roofing — referenced as context; EPDM sheet systems are evaluated under EN 13956 directly.

**Portuguese / National Level**
- NP EN 13956: Portuguese adoption of the European standard without modification.
- LNEC DTA (Documento de Aprovação Técnica): National technical approvals issued by LNEC for
  specific systems and installation methods. Membriko specifies only LNEC-approved or CE-marked
  systems.
- RGEU Art. 90: Minimum 1% slope for flat roofs (Membriko designs to 2% minimum as best practice).
- DTU 43 (French reference): Referenced by Portuguese engineers as the closest equivalent
  technical installation guide pending a Portuguese equivalent.

**Fire Regulations**
- DL 220/2008 and Portaria 1532/2008 (SCIE — Segurança Contra Incêndio em Edifícios):
  Commercial and public buildings require fire reaction class documentation. EPDM = Class E
  (EN 13501-1). Where BROOF(t4) is required (external fire performance), a mineral ballast layer
  or fire-barrier board is specified.

## Section 11: Common Problems and Prevention

**Purpose:** Build trust by demonstrating we know where installations fail and why — and that our
process prevents each failure mode.

**Content:** Seven failure points as an expandable list or accordion.

1. **Inadequate Substrate Preparation**
   - Problem: Membrane bonded to dusty, wet or friable surface; adhesion fails within 2-5 years
   - Prevention: Membriko requires substrate pull-off test (EN 12188) > 0.08 N/mm² before bonding

2. **Insufficient Upstand Height**
   - Problem: RGEU requires minimum 150 mm upstand; short upstands allow water ingress behind
     flashing during heavy rain
   - Prevention: All Membriko upstands are minimum 200 mm, fully bonded and mechanically secured
     at the top edge

3. **Penetration Sealing Failures**
   - Problem: Pipes and roof penetrations sealed with mastic instead of prefabricated EPDM boots;
     mastic dries and cracks within 3-5 years
   - Prevention: Prefabricated EPDM pipe boots and pressure-ring seals used on all penetrations;
     no exposed mastic on new installations

4. **Thermal Bridge at Mechanical Fixings**
   - Problem: Incorrect fixing type or spacing creates condensation risk in inverted roof
     configurations
   - Prevention: Thermal calculation per EN ISO 10211 for all mechanically fastened designs;
     insulated fixing plates where required

5. **Seam Adhesive Application in Adverse Conditions**
   - Problem: Solvent adhesive applied when ambient temperature is below 5°C or above 35°C, or
     when relative humidity exceeds 80%; seam strength is compromised
   - Prevention: Membriko technicians carry digital hygrometers and thermometers; installation
     paused or moved to self-adhered tape seaming when conditions are outside adhesive window

6. **Drains Installed Without Sump Detail**
   - Problem: Flat drain collar installed flush with membrane surface; water pools around drain
     and increases pressure at seam
   - Prevention: All drains include a sumped cast-iron or EPDM-compatible flange detail to ensure
     positive drainage gradient to drain mouth

7. **No Post-Installation Leak Test**
   - Problem: Minor installation defects that are invisible to visual inspection allow slow
     infiltration to structural elements before the next rain event
   - Prevention: 100% of Membriko installations are flood-tested (EN 1187 methodology adapted for
     flat roofs) or electronically tested before sign-off

## Section 12: ROI and Lifecycle Cost

**Purpose:** Justify a premium over bituminous competitors with a rational financial case.

**Content:**

**30-Year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) — Illustrative Comparison per 100 m²**

| Cost Component | EPDM | Bitumen APP | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial installation | Index 100 | Index 80 | EPDM premium approximately 20-25% |
| Replacement at year 15-20 | 0 | Index 85 | Bitumen requires full replacement |
| Maintenance (annual inspection + minor repairs) | Index 5 per decade | Index 15 per decade | EPDM requires minimal maintenance |
| Water damage events | Near zero (design life > 30 yr) | Moderate (typical failure at 12-18 yr) | Indirect cost; very variable |
| **Total 30-year cost** | **~Index 115** | **~Index 195** | **EPDM saves approximately 40%** |

Note: These are illustrative indices, not real prices. Actual quotations depend on project specifics.

**Energy Savings Note:** A 1.5 mm EPDM membrane in a warm-roof configuration over 100 mm PIR
insulation achieves U-values of 0.18-0.22 W/m²K, meeting or exceeding RCCTE requirements for
roofs (0.35 W/m²K). Each 0.1 W/m²K improvement reduces annual heating energy demand by
approximately 2-4 kWh/m²/year depending on climate zone.

**Residual Value:** Buildings with documented EPDM waterproofing and remaining warranty attract
a premium from valuers and mortgage lenders due to the eliminated reinvestment risk during the
next ownership period.

## Section 13: Why Membriko

**Purpose:** Consolidate the emotional and rational case; final conversion push.

**Content:**
- Brief positioning statement: Membriko is Portugal's specialist EPDM installer, not a generalist
  waterproofing contractor who also installs EPDM
- 3 differentiators (each one sentence):
  1. Single material expertise — every technician is trained and certified specifically in EPDM
     fabrication and installation, not rotated between materials
  2. Documented process — written specification, as-built record, electronic leak test result,
     and 20-year warranty certificate delivered to every client
  3. No-subcontract policy — Membriko crews execute all installations; no third-party labour
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Proposta Gratuita" (button)
- Secondary CTA: "Falar com um Técnico" (phone or chat link)

## Section 14: FAQ

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail search intent and reduce pre-sales questions. Unique questions —
no overlap with flat-roofs.ts FAQ.

Eight questions:

1. **O EPDM funciona em coberturas com inclinação zero (terraço plano)?**
   Yes — EPDM performs at 0% slope. However, for slopes below 1%, we require a hydraulic drainage
   assessment and recommend specifying 75 mm deep drains and sumps to manage ponding duration.
   The membrane itself is unaffected by standing water.

2. **Quanto pesa uma membrana EPDM de 1,2 mm com lastro de seixo?**
   The EPDM membrane itself weighs approximately 1.4-1.6 kg/m² at 1.2 mm. Rounded gravel ballast
   adds 50-80 kg/m². Total system weight for a ballasted installation is typically 52-82 kg/m²
   plus insulation. A structural engineer must verify the slab can carry this load.

3. **O EPDM é afetado pelo cloro da água da piscina ou da limpeza?**
   No. EPDM is chemically resistant to dilute chlorine concentrations typical of pool maintenance
   or cleaning. For surfaces with permanent chlorinated water exposure, we specify the appropriate
   EPDM formulation and verify compatibility with the specific cleaning agent.

4. **Posso instalar EPDM eu mesmo (DIY) numa cobertura plana residencial?**
   For very small areas (< 15 m²) such as bay window roofs, prefabricated DIY EPDM kits exist.
   For larger areas, professional installation is strongly recommended: seam adhesive handling,
   singular point fabrication and leak testing require trained personnel. A DIY failure on a 150 m²
   roof costs more to remediate than professional installation would have cost.

5. **O EPDM pode ser pintado ou revestido para combinar com a arquitectura do edifício?**
   Standard EPDM is black and not typically painted. Cool-roof acrylic topcoats (white or grey)
   compatible with EPDM are available and can reduce rooftop surface temperature by 15-25°C,
   improving energy performance. The coating must be EPDM-compatible (non-solvent-based).

6. **Qual é o tempo de espera desde a visita técnica até ao início da instalação?**
   Typically 10-15 working days from technical visit to mobilisation for standard residential
   projects. Complex commercial projects with engineering deliverables may take 3-4 weeks from
   survey to start on site. Membriko provides a written programme with all quotations.

7. **O seguro de obras cobre danos causados por falha de impermeabilização EPDM?**
   Construction liability insurance (seguro de responsabilidade civil da empreitada) covers
   installation defects during the warranty period. Membriko's 20-year warranty is separate from
   and supplementary to the statutory 5-year defects liability under the Portuguese Civil Code
   (Código Civil, Art. 1225). Clients receive documentation of both.

8. **O EPDM é compatível com membranas de impermeabilização líquida para detalhes pontuais?**
   Compatibility depends on the specific liquid membrane formulation. Polyurethane and PMMA
   systems require a tested primer to bond to EPDM. Cementitious coatings are generally not
   compatible. Membriko only uses tested, compatible detail systems from the same product family
   as the sheet membrane to avoid interface failures.
