# EPDM Membrane Lining for Wastewater Treatment Facilities

## Section 1: The Portuguese Wastewater Infrastructure Challenge

Portugal has built one of southern Europe's most extensive wastewater treatment networks over the past three decades. Driven by European Cohesion Fund investment and the successive requirements of EU environmental directives, urban sanitation coverage rose from approximately 55% of the population in 1993 to over 88% by 2023. That expansion produced roughly 3,800 Estações de Tratamento de Águas Residuais — ETARs — ranging from large urban facilities managed by Águas de Portugal subsidiaries to small municipal works serving inland communities of a few hundred inhabitants.

That legacy of public investment now faces a structural challenge that was not fully appreciated when the network was built: biogenic acid corrosion. The sulphate-reducing bacteria that thrive in anaerobic zones of wastewater treatment systems produce hydrogen sulphide (H₂S), which oxidises at exposed concrete surfaces above the waterline to form sulphuric acid. The acid attacks the calcium silicate hydrate binder of Portland cement with a ferocity that can destroy 5 to 10 millimetres of concrete per year in severe conditions. Many of the concrete clarifiers, digesters, and lagoon structures built between 1990 and 2005 are now at or approaching the end of their effective service life — often at 25 to 30 years rather than the 50-year design horizon originally intended.

The regulatory environment is simultaneously tightening. The recast Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (EU) 2022/1072, which is being transposed into Portuguese law and will impose progressive obligations through to 2045, requires large treatment works to achieve energy neutrality, introduces mandatory micro-pollutant removal for significant discharges, and strengthens environmental monitoring requirements across the sector. ERSAR — the Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos — continues to publish annual performance assessments that expose the operational quality of individual utilities across the sector. APA, the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente, issues and enforces discharge consents and environmental licences under Decreto-Lei 152/97 and Decreto-Lei 236/98. Regulatory scrutiny of ETAR performance has never been greater.

The infrastructure consequence is significant: the Portuguese wastewater sector needs to rehabilitate ageing assets whilst simultaneously investing in upgraded treatment capacity to meet new regulatory standards. This creates a sustained demand for reliable, permanent lining systems in clarifiers, digesters, lagoons, constructed wetland systems, and sludge management facilities across the country.

Membriko, based in Pombal, Leiria, is the specialist supplier for EPDM geomembrane systems in Portuguese ETAR applications. Membriko EPDM lining provides the chemical resistance that no other common construction material can match across the full spectrum of wastewater treatment chemistry: hydrogen sulphide, biogenic sulphuric acid, ammonia, chlorine, and organic acids — all present simultaneously in operating treatment works. With a projected service life exceeding 50 years and a 20-year installation warranty, Membriko EPDM systems provide the containment foundation on which ETAR rehabilitation and new construction investments can be built with confidence.

## Section 2: Why EPDM for ETAR Applications — The Chemistry of Resistance

The choice of EPDM for wastewater treatment lining is not a preference — it is the logical consequence of the chemistry involved. To understand why, it is necessary to understand what happens to other materials in the ETAR environment.

Concrete fails through biogenic acid corrosion. Sulphate-reducing bacteria in anaerobic zones of primary clarifiers, sludge digesters, covered sewer networks, and stabilisation lagoons produce hydrogen sulphide as a metabolic by-product. This colourless, toxic gas rises through the liquid and into the headspace above the waterline. At the concrete surface, aerobic sulphur-oxidising bacteria — predominantly Thiobacillus thiooxidans — convert the H₂S to sulphuric acid in the biogenic acid corrosion (BAC) mechanism. The sulphuric acid attacks the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) binder of Portland cement concrete through a two-stage degradation pathway: first, decalcification of CSH produces calcium sulphate (gypsum); second, residual aluminate phases react with sulphate to form ettringite, a highly expansive compound that causes internal cracking and progressive concrete disintegration. Field measurements at European municipal ETARs have documented concrete surface loss rates of 5 to 10 mm per year in primary clarifiers and primary digesters with sustained H₂S concentrations above 100 ppm in the headspace.

Epoxy coatings provide temporary protection but are not a permanent solution. They are brittle across substrate cracks; they must be reapplied every five to ten years as the coating ages; and they provide no crack-bridging capability in structures subject to thermal movement or hydraulic loading. PVC geomembranes are subject to plasticiser migration and UV degradation, and their resistance to H₂S and biogenic acid is inferior to EPDM in sustained exposure. HDPE geomembranes offer better chemical resistance but are mechanically brittle at low temperatures and prone to stress cracking at folds, penetrations, and structural transitions — the most failure-prone locations in any containment system.

EPDM — Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer — is chemically different from all of these materials in a fundamental way. The vulcanised EPDM polymer backbone consists of a saturated carbon-carbon main chain with no acid-reactive functional groups. There is no calcium to dissolve, no plasticiser to extract, no ester linkage to hydrolyse, no oxidisable unsaturated bond along the backbone. The diene monomer (typically ethylidene norbornene, ENB) provides cross-linking sites for the vulcanisation reaction but is incorporated into saturated side groups that are inert after cure. Carbon black loading at 35 to 55 parts per hundred rubber (phr) provides intrinsic UV absorption without any sacrificial UV stabiliser package that could deplete over time.

The consequence is that EPDM tested in 40% sulphuric acid at 70°C according to ASTM D471 shows no measurable change in hardness, tensile strength, or elongation at break after 168 hours of immersion. EPDM tested in 200 ppm sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) at 70°C shows no measurable change. EPDM immersed in concentrated ammonia at elevated temperature shows no measurable change. These are not general claims — they are reproducible test results that reflect the intrinsic chemistry of the saturated polymer.

Membriko specifies EPDM geomembranes formulated specifically for wastewater treatment environments, conforming to EN 13491 and EN 13361, with properties as follows:

## Section 3: Facility Types — Where Membriko EPDM Is Applied in Treatment Works

Membriko installs EPDM lining and cover systems across the complete spectrum of wastewater treatment infrastructure. The breadth of application reflects the fact that virtually every wetted or gas-exposed surface in an ETAR presents chemical conditions that EPDM handles better than any alternative material.

### Stabilisation Lagoons

Stabilisation lagoons are used extensively across rural Portugal for small municipal ETARs and in agro-industrial wastewater treatment — wineries, olive oil mills, livestock operations, and dairy processing facilities. The lagoon receives raw or pre-settled wastewater and treats it by a combination of natural biological processes: algal photosynthesis, UV disinfection, sedimentation, and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial activity. Treatment performance depends entirely on maintaining hydraulic containment — seepage loss reduces hydraulic retention time and allows partially treated effluent to contaminate groundwater.

Membriko EPDM is the material of choice for lagoon lining because large-format rolls up to 15.25 metres wide can be specified, dramatically reducing the number of field seams that must be made in the most hydraulically demanding part of any containment system. EPDM's UV stability in open, uncovered lagoons is intrinsic to the polymer chemistry, not dependent on additive packages that deplete over time. Root resistance to EN 13948 is critical at lagoon margins where emergent vegetation — including the aggressive root systems of common reeds and invasive plant species — can establish and penetrate inadequate liner materials. Membriko lagoon liners comply with EN 13361 (geosynthetic barriers for liquid retention), providing the certification baseline required for ERSAR and APA regulatory compliance files.

### Anaerobic Digesters

Anaerobic digesters present the most aggressive chemical conditions in any wastewater treatment facility. Primary and secondary digesters at large municipal ETARs, agricultural biogas plants (Unidades de Tratamento de Bioresíduos), and co-digestion facilities all operate in conditions that eliminate most conventional lining materials within five to fifteen years. The digester environment combines:

- Biogas atmosphere: 60–70% methane, 30–40% CO₂, hydrogen sulphide at concentrations up to several thousand ppm, ammonia vapour, and water
- Liquid phase chemistry: pH 6 to 8 in mesophilic operation; acidogenic phases in two-stage digestion may reach pH 4 to 5; ammonia concentrations of 2,000 to 5,000 mg/L from protein breakdown
- Temperature: 35–40°C (mesophilic) or 50–55°C (thermophilic operation)

Membriko EPDM is applied in digesters as wall and floor lining, as single and double-membrane floating covers for gas collection and odour containment, and as biogas collection bladders on open digester systems. EPDM's continuous immersion rating to 90°C provides substantial safety margin above thermophilic operating temperatures. Its resistance to methane, CO₂, H₂S, ammonia, and organic acids is chemically intrinsic — unlike coatings that may soften or delaminate under sustained chemical attack at elevated temperature.

### Primary and Secondary Clarifiers

Circular and rectangular clarifiers — decantadores primários e secundários — are among the structures most severely affected by biogenic acid corrosion in Portuguese ETARs. The splash zone at the waterline in primary clarifiers, where H₂S-laden wastewater surface is continuously agitated, creates the conditions for maximum biogenic acid production and delivery to the concrete surface. Concrete loss rates of 5 to 10 mm per year in primary clarifiers have been documented at European ETARs.

Membriko EPDM lining of clarifier walls and floors provides complete, permanent isolation of the concrete substrate from the chemical environment. The membrane bridges substrate cracks up to several millimetres in width without loss of watertightness — a critical capability in tanks subject to thermal cycling and hydraulic loading. Membriko installs EPDM in new-build clarifiers as a long-term asset protection measure, and in the rehabilitation of clarifiers where concrete has been partially lost to BAC and the structure requires both repair and a permanent protective membrane.

### Sequencing Batch Reactors

SBR tanks alternate between aeration cycles — with dissolved oxygen maintained at 1 to 3 mg/L by surface aerators or fine bubble diffusers — and quiescent settling phases in which activated sludge settles by gravity. The cyclic hydraulic loading, vibration from aeration equipment, and periodic wetting and drying of tank walls above the operating level create fatigue conditions that challenge rigid lining systems. Epoxy coatings applied to SBR walls experience cyclic shear stress at the coating-substrate interface and are prone to delamination at corners and around aeration equipment penetrations.

Membriko EPDM's elongation at break exceeding 300% and elastomeric recovery under cyclic strain make it uniquely suited to the dynamic loading conditions of SBR tanks. A bonded Membriko EPDM lining system accommodates substrate movement and aeration vibration without fatigue failure at stress concentrations. Membriko details EPDM lining around aeration diffuser penetrations and equipment supports using prefabricated EPDM boots and collar seals that maintain watertightness through dynamic operational cycles.

### Constructed Wetland Systems and Reed Beds

Constructed wetland systems — leitos de juncos and filtros de macrófitas — are widely used in rural Portugal for tertiary treatment at small and medium ETARs, and as the primary treatment system for rural settlements below 2,000 population equivalents where conventional biological treatment is not economically justified. Subsurface or surface-flow reed bed systems treat secondary effluent through biological and physicochemical processes in a gravel substrate planted with Phragmites australis or other wetland macrophytes.

The reed bed basin must contain treated effluent and prevent infiltration to groundwater — both a regulatory requirement and a treatment performance requirement, since groundwater ingress can cause hydraulic short-circuiting and undermine treatment efficiency. The root system of Phragmites australis is notably aggressive; reed roots have been documented penetrating inadequately specified geomembrane materials in constructed wetland installations.

Membriko EPDM is the standard lining material for constructed wetland systems for two reasons specific to this application: EN 13948 root resistance certification, providing documented protection against Phragmites root penetration; and intrinsic UV stability for those portions of the liner exposed above the substrate at lagoon margins. Membriko reed bed liners are installed prior to placement of the gravel filter media and planting material, with perimeter terminations designed to accommodate the weight loading of the filter substrate without membrane stress.

### Sludge Lagoons and Drying Beds

Sludge storage lagoons and sludge drying beds present high concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide from the decomposition of organic matter in stored sludge. Total ammonia-nitrogen in digested sludge liquor typically ranges from 1,500 to 5,000 mg/L — concentrations that will degrade PVC liner plasticisers and attack some epoxy coating formulations under sustained high-concentration exposure.

Membriko EPDM sludge lagoon liners provide complete resistance to NH₃ and H₂S at all concentrations present in sludge storage and processing. For facilities where odour from sludge lagoons creates community relations or regulatory compliance issues, Membriko installs partial EPDM cover panels over sludge storage lagoons to contain odorous gases for extraction and treatment by biofilter or chemical scrubber.

## Section 4: Chemical Resistance — H₂S, Biogenic Acid, Ammonia, and Chlorine

The chemical environment in a wastewater treatment facility is not a single aggressive agent but a complex, variable mixture that changes by facility zone, process phase, and seasonal conditions. Membriko EPDM is specified because it provides intrinsic, durable resistance to every significant chemical constituent of the wastewater treatment environment — not resistance to one or two agents with vulnerability to others.

### Hydrogen Sulphide and Biogenic Sulphuric Acid

Hydrogen sulphide is generated wherever sulphate-reducing bacteria operate under anaerobic conditions: primary clarifier sludge blankets, anaerobic digester liquid phases, sludge storage lagoons, covered gravity sewers feeding the ETAR, and stabilisation lagoon bottom layers. In the gas phase, H₂S is toxic, highly corrosive, and the precursor to the biogenic acid corrosion mechanism that destroys concrete infrastructure.

At the concrete surface above the waterline in primary clarifiers and inlet works, aerobic sulphur-oxidising bacteria convert H₂S to sulphuric acid. The biogenic sulphuric acid attacks calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) through decalcification and ettringite formation, progressively destroying the structural integrity of the concrete. In severe conditions — primary clarifiers with H₂S headspace concentrations above 100 ppm — concrete loss of 5 to 10 mm per year has been documented by European university research teams and published in the European Water Association's technical literature. A 300 mm concrete wall could fail structurally in under thirty years under sustained attack at these rates.

Membriko EPDM offers complete resistance to hydrogen sulphide and to sulphuric acid across the full concentration range present in wastewater treatment — from the dilute biogenic acid at concrete surfaces through to concentrated acid cleaning solutions used during equipment maintenance. The saturated EPDM polymer backbone has no sulphide-reactive functional groups and no acid-hydrolysable bonds. ASTM D471 immersion test data at 40% H₂SO₄ and 70°C — conditions considerably more aggressive than any wastewater environment — show no measurable change in hardness, tensile strength, or elongation at break. Membriko EPDM does not merely resist biogenic acid; it is chemically inert to it.

### Ammonia

Ammonia (NH₃ / NH₄⁺ in equilibrium according to pH) is a major constituent of municipal wastewater from protein metabolism, and reaches its highest concentrations in the liquid phase of anaerobic digesters treating sludge and high-strength organic effluent. Total ammonia-nitrogen (TAN) in digested sludge liquor typically ranges from 1,500 to 5,000 mg/L; in some co-digestion facilities processing high-nitrogen substrates, TAN can exceed 7,000 mg/L.

PVC geomembranes are vulnerable to ammonia at high concentrations because amine compounds can interact with PVC plasticisers, accelerating their migration into the surrounding liquid and causing progressive embrittlement of the membrane. Some epoxy coating systems use amine-based curing agents that can be attacked by ammonia under sustained high-concentration exposure, leading to softening and eventual coating disbondment.

Membriko EPDM is inert to ammonia at all concentrations present in wastewater treatment and sludge processing. The saturated EPDM backbone has no amine-reactive or ester-reactive functional groups. ASTM D471 testing in concentrated ammonia solution at elevated temperature confirms no measurable property change, supporting Membriko's specification of EPDM in digesters and sludge lagoons where ammonia concentrations are at their highest.

### Chlorine and Sodium Hypochlorite

Many Portuguese ETARs apply chlorination as a tertiary disinfection step before discharge to receiving water bodies. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is dosed at concentrations of 5 to 20 mg/L in tertiary contact tanks. In some facilities, higher hypochlorite concentrations are used for equipment disinfection during maintenance shutdowns. Hypochlorite is a powerful oxidising agent that degrades PVC plasticisers by oxidative attack, damages unsaturated rubber polymers along their double-bond sites, and bleaches and embrittles some epoxy formulations under sustained exposure.

Membriko EPDM is fully resistant to sodium hypochlorite at all concentrations used in tertiary disinfection and equipment maintenance. ASTM D471 testing at 200 ppm NaOCl and 70°C — concentrations and temperatures well above any operational exposure in tertiary treatment — shows no measurable property change. This is the same intrinsic chlorine resistance that makes Membriko EPDM the standard material for swimming pool liners: the chemical mechanism is identical in both applications.

### UV Radiation in Open Lagoon Systems

Stabilisation lagoons, polishing ponds, and aeration lagoons are typically open to the sky and receive full solar UV radiation throughout their operating life. UV radiation is the primary degradation mechanism for most geomembrane materials in outdoor service: it initiates photooxidation of polymer chains, causing surface crazing, embrittlement, and eventual mechanical failure that allows the underlying substrate to be exposed to the contained liquid.

EPDM's UV stability is intrinsic: the saturated carbon-carbon backbone is not susceptible to photooxidation, and the carbon black loading at 35 to 55 phr provides additional UV absorption that converts radiation energy to heat without polymer damage. Field samples taken from EPDM lagoon liners installed in Germany and France in the 1970s and 1980s — with 30 or more years of continuous outdoor exposure — and tested against original material specifications show tensile strength retention above 90% and elongation retention above 85% of the original values. Membriko specifies EPDM for open lagoon systems with confidence grounded in this extensive field record.

## Section 5: Membriko Installation Process — Seven Stages

Membriko applies a structured, seven-stage installation methodology for ETAR lining and cover projects. The methodology is adapted from standard geomembrane installation practice to the specific requirements of operational wastewater treatment facilities, where health and safety considerations, confined space requirements, regulatory documentation needs, and minimisation of treatment capacity interruption are all critical factors.

**Stage 1 — Technical Survey and Diagnosis**

Before any specification or design work, Membriko conducts a comprehensive site survey. For tank rehabilitation projects, this includes structural assessment of the concrete substrate — mapping of surface deterioration depth by hammer testing and core sampling, identification of active cracks requiring prior injection treatment, assessment of reinforcement exposure, and measurement of residual concrete cover. For new-build or lagoon projects, the survey covers geotechnical assessment of the subgrade, identification of subsoil drainage requirements, and a full inventory of pipework penetrations, inlet and outlet structures, and equipment interfaces that require membrane detailing.

**Stage 2 — Membrane Specification and Seam Layout Design**

Based on the survey findings, Membriko prepares a membrane specification — thickness, grade, and EN standard reference — together with a seam layout plan that minimises the number of field seams and positions them at accessible, low-stress locations. Penetration schedules are developed for every interface between the membrane and the structure. For digester cover projects, gas extraction fitting locations, floating cover edge seal details, and ballast chain arrangements are designed at this stage.

**Stage 3 — Substrate Preparation**

Concrete tanks with BAC damage require preparation before membrane installation. Active cracks wider than 0.3 mm are sealed by polyurethane injection. Delaminated concrete is removed and made good with polymer-modified cementitious mortar. Surface planarity is verified against Membriko's tolerance for bonded lining systems. For lagoon projects, the anchor trench for perimeter termination of the membrane is excavated and the subgrade compacted and blinded with a sand layer where the geotechnical assessment indicates the need for a drainage layer beneath the membrane.

**Stage 4 — Membrane Installation**

Membrane rolls are deployed and positioned according to the seam layout plan. Seams are formed using self-adhesive QuickSeam lap tape (solvent-activated contact bonding) as standard for field seaming of Membriko EPDM, or by hot-air fusion welding for applications requiring factory-grade seam strength. All seaming is carried out by trained and experienced Membriko operatives.

**Stage 5 — Penetrations, Terminations, and Singular Details**

Penetrations through the membrane — for inlet and outlet pipes, aeration diffuser supports, drainage pipework, and monitoring instrumentation — are detailed using prefabricated EPDM boots and flanged pipe collars that form a continuous, mechanically sound seal. Wall terminations use stainless steel batten bars fixed to the substrate, clamping the membrane perimeter at the specified termination level. For floating digester covers, gas extraction fitting seals, access hatch details, and perimeter seal arrangements are completed at this stage.

**Stage 6 — Inspection and Watertightness Testing**

All seams are inspected visually by the Membriko site supervisor and tested by vacuum box or spark test before the lagoon or tank is flooded. A hydraulic acceptance test — filling to operating level and monitoring for 72 hours — provides final confirmation of system watertightness. All test results are recorded and included in the as-built documentation package.

**Stage 7 — Warranty and Regulatory Documentation**

At project handover, Membriko provides a complete documentation package: the 20-year installation warranty certificate; CE-marked membrane data sheets and Declaration of Performance; seam test records; the hydraulic acceptance test record; photographic as-built record; and a maintenance protocol. For public procurement projects, the documentation package supports the environmental licensing file submitted to APA and meets ERSAR reporting requirements for regulated utility assets.

## Section 6: Rehabilitation of Existing ETARs — The Case for EPDM Over Alternatives

The rehabilitation of ETARs with failing concrete represents a substantial and growing proportion of the current Portuguese wastewater infrastructure market. The pattern is consistent across the sector: a facility built between 1990 and 2005, commissioned with no lining system or with a short-life epoxy coating, is now exhibiting progressive concrete deterioration in primary clarifiers, inlet works, and anaerobic zones. The utility faces three options.

The first option is concrete demolition and reconstruction — tearing out the damaged structure and building a new reinforced concrete tank. This is the most expensive approach, typically requiring 8 to 20 weeks of facility shutdown depending on tank size, complete loss of treatment capacity for that unit during the construction programme, and substantial embodied carbon from new concrete production. For large primary digesters at municipal ETARs serving populations above 20,000 PE, the cost can exceed the capital budget available to Portuguese municipal utilities operating under ERSAR financial sustainability constraints.

The second option is surface coating — applying a new epoxy or polyurethane coating to the prepared concrete surface. This can typically be accomplished in 2 to 4 weeks per tank, but it is not a permanent solution. Coatings applied to concrete structures subject to thermal cycling, residual moisture migration, and continued biogenic acid attack have a practical service life of 5 to 10 years before recoating is required. Each recoating cycle requires emptying, cleaning, surface preparation, and application — a recurring operational and financial burden that compounds over time. Coatings cannot bridge structural cracks that develop in the substrate after installation; a crack that propagates through the concrete will propagate through the coating applied above it.

The third option — and the one Membriko recommends where permanent containment is the objective — is EPDM membrane lining. A Membriko EPDM lining system installed over prepared concrete provides a continuous, crack-bridging, chemically resistant containment layer designed for a 50-year service life. It is installed once. It is not subject to a recoating cycle. Its elongation at break exceeding 300% means that substrate crack movement up to several millimetres in width is accommodated without any loss of watertightness.

Membriko installs rehabilitation EPDM lining systems over corroded concrete (after repair of structural damage and surface preparation), over sound existing epoxy or polyurethane coatings (after mechanical keying to provide adhesion surface), and over existing HDPE geomembrane that has reached end of life or has localised damage (retaining the HDPE as a drainage layer beneath the new EPDM).

For operational ETARs, Membriko plans rehabilitation programmes to minimise treatment capacity interruption. Tank lining typically requires a shutdown of 5 to 15 working days depending on tank size and substrate preparation requirements. Lagoon rehabilitation can often be phased — one cell out of service at a time — to maintain partial treatment capacity throughout the programme. Where required by the terms of the environmental licence, Membriko prepares the regulatory notification to APA of the rehabilitation works and coordinates this with the facility operator.

## Section 7: EPDM Odour Containment Covers for ETAR Facilities

The odour challenge at wastewater treatment works is not a cosmetic issue — it is a regulatory compliance challenge and a community relations risk that can directly threaten the operating licence of an ETAR located near residential areas. Hydrogen sulphide has a perceptible odour threshold as low as 0.001 ppm, well below any toxicological threshold but perfectly detectable by residents living within several hundred metres of a facility. APA licensing for new ETARs and for significant expansions of existing facilities increasingly requires an odour management plan as a condition of the environmental licence. ERSAR performance monitoring includes odour complaint incidence as an indicator of service quality.

Membriko EPDM cover systems address the odour challenge as an extension of the same membrane capability applied to tank interiors, providing a complete solution from a single specialist supplier rather than requiring separate lining and cover products from different sources.

### Floating EPDM Covers for Clarifiers and Sludge Tanks

A floating Membriko EPDM cover consists of a reinforced membrane panel laid on the liquid surface, with an edge seal to the tank wall at the operating level, a perimeter drainage channel to collect precipitation that falls on the upper membrane surface, and a gas extraction fitting connected to an odour treatment system — biofilter, chemical scrubber, or regenerative thermal oxidiser. EPDM's specific gravity of approximately 1.0 makes it nearly neutrally buoyant, facilitating deployment on the liquid surface and minimising structural loads on the tank walls from floating cover weight and wind uplift.

The key operational advantage of a floating cover over a fixed cover is that the membrane rises and falls with the liquid level during normal operations — fill and draw cycles, storm inflow, and sludge drawdown — without creating membrane stress. Membriko details floating covers with a perimeter slack arrangement that accommodates the full range of operating liquid levels specified by the facility design. Floating covers are specified at 1.5 to 2.0 mm reinforced Membriko EPDM for primary clarifiers and sludge thickeners.

### Fixed EPDM Covers for Inlet Works and Screening Areas

Inlet works — screens, grit channels, and flow measurement structures — are typically the highest-odour point in an ETAR, as raw, septified wastewater arriving from long sewer catchments releases accumulated H₂S on entry to the treatment works. Fixed Membriko EPDM covers over inlet works structures consist of membrane panels supported on a lightweight steel or GRP framework, providing odour containment without the floating cover mechanism required for variable-level tanks. Access hatches with EPDM compression seals allow maintenance access without compromising the cover's gas containment integrity.

### Digester Covers for Biogas Collection and Odour Containment

Anaerobic digester covers perform a dual function: they contain odorous biogas from the treatment process and, if designed for gas collection, allow the methane-rich biogas to be utilised for energy generation. Membriko designs and installs both single-membrane digester covers (for odour containment only) and double-membrane floating gas-holder covers (for combined gas collection and odour containment). In the double-membrane system, an inner EPDM membrane collects biogas from the digester liquid surface; the gas collected between the inner membrane and the outer protective EPDM membrane provides the gas storage volume; blowers maintain differential pressure to extract gas to the utilisation system. Membriko designs floating gas-holder covers for digester capacities from 500 m³ to 5,000 m³.

The biogas collection capability of Membriko EPDM digester covers is directly relevant to the energy neutrality requirements of the recast Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. A municipal ETAR with full sludge digestion and biogas recovery can generate sufficient electricity from combined heat and power (CHP) to meet a substantial proportion of the facility's energy demand. Membriko coordinates digester cover design with biogas utilisation system suppliers and the facility's electrical engineering team to ensure compatibility of cover gas extraction with CHP system requirements.

## Section 8: EPDM Compared with HDPE, PVC, Epoxy Coatings, and Bare Concrete

Membriko presents this comparison as an objective technical assessment for project engineers evaluating lining system options. Where alternative materials are genuinely appropriate, this assessment says so.

| Property | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | PVC Geomembrane | Epoxy Coating | Unprotected Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life in ETAR | 50+ years | 25–35 years | 8–15 years | 5–10 years (to recoat) | 10–20 years (BAC) |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300–400% | 12–18% | 200–300% | 0–5% | 0% |
| H₂SO₄ resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Good | Moderate | Good (when intact) | Fails via BAC mechanism |
| NH₃ resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Excellent | Moderate (plasticiser risk) | Good | Moderate |
| H₂S resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Good | Moderate | Good (when intact) | Fails via BAC mechanism |
| UV resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Good (stabiliser-dependent) | Poor without additives | Moderate | Good |
| Stress cracking | Not a failure mode | Key failure mode | Not applicable | Bridging: none | Crack propagation |
| Cold temperature | Flexible at −45°C | Brittle below +5°C | Good | Brittle | Good |
| Seam method | Self-adhesive tape or contact adhesive | Hot-wedge thermal fusion | Solvent or heat weld | Liquid-applied | Concrete joint |
| Root resistance | Excellent (EN 13948 certified) | Good | Poor | None | None |
| Crack bridging | Excellent (≥ 300% elongation) | Poor (12–18% elongation) | Moderate | None — fails at cracks | N/A |
| Maintenance requirement | Annual inspection; no recoating | Annual inspection | Periodic; shorter life | Recoating every 5–10 years | Replacement or recoating |
| CE certification | EN 13956, EN 13361 | EN 13361 | EN 13361 | — | — |

**Honest assessment.** HDPE geomembranes are a rational choice for very large, regular-geometry lagoons — reservoirs with simple geometry, minimal penetrations, and long straight seam runs that can be made mechanically with a track-mounted hot-wedge welder under controlled conditions. In those specific applications, HDPE can achieve good field seam quality and provides a lower installed cost than EPDM. Where HDPE is inappropriate is in tanks with multiple penetrations, complex geometry, frequent thermal cycling, or low-temperature winter installation — precisely the conditions that characterise most ETAR clarifier and digester rehabilitation projects in Portugal.

Epoxy coating systems are appropriate for concrete surfaces with no structural cracking, accessible for periodic recoating, and where the 5 to 10 year recoating cycle is operationally and financially manageable. They are not appropriate where substrate cracking is present or anticipated, where sustained H₂S exposure creates disbondment risk, or where operational disruption of repeated recoating is unacceptable.

Membriko's recommendation is EPDM — specified and installed by Membriko — where the design objective is permanent, maintenance-free containment across the full ETAR chemical environment.

## Section 9: Technical Specifications for Wastewater Treatment Applications

Membriko specifies EPDM geomembranes to the following standard parameters for ETAR applications. Project-specific specifications are developed from this baseline following the site survey and design process. All Membriko EPDM geomembranes conform to EN 13491 and EN 13361.

| Property | Specification Value | Test Standard |

Membrane thickness selection is a mechanical rather than chemical decision: all specified Membriko thicknesses provide complete chemical resistance to the ETAR environment. Thickness is specified according to the mechanical demands of the application — submerged hydrostatic loading, UV exposure level, expected traffic from maintenance activities, and the presence of sludge scraper mechanisms that may impose abrasion loads on clarifier floors.

Membriko advises project engineers that the EPDM membrane specification alone does not define the system performance: seam quality, substrate preparation standard, penetration detailing, and perimeter termination design collectively determine the watertightness and durability of the installed system. Membriko controls all of these variables through its integrated supply and installation service, delivering a warranted system rather than a supplied product.

## Section 10: Maintenance of Membriko EPDM Systems in ETAR Service

One of the principal arguments for Membriko EPDM in ETAR applications is its exceptionally low maintenance requirement — a direct consequence of the intrinsic chemical resistance that means the membrane does not gradually degrade in the way that epoxy coatings, PVC membranes, and even HDPE geomembranes do over time in the wastewater environment.

**Routine Annual Inspection**

Membriko recommends an annual visual inspection of all membrane surfaces, field seams, perimeter terminations, and penetration details. The inspection should be carried out during a scheduled maintenance shutdown, or for large lagoons, from facility access roads and berm tops using binoculars for the main membrane field, with close inspection of perimeter areas from the lagoon margin. Inspection points should be referenced to the photographic as-built record provided at handover by Membriko, so that any changes in membrane appearance can be detected against a known baseline. Membriko can provide trained inspectors for annual inspection services for clients who require it.

**Biological Fouling**

EPDM surfaces in contact with biologically active wastewater will develop biofilm and algal growth over time. This biological fouling does not indicate membrane degradation — EPDM is not a nutrient source for micro-organisms and the growth occurs on the surface rather than penetrating the membrane. Biological fouling on Membriko EPDM surfaces is removed by pressure washing at up to 150 bar, by scrubbing with a stiff brush, or by application of a dilute sodium hypochlorite solution. Post-cleaning inspection confirms that the underlying EPDM surface remains intact.

**Puncture Repair**

Punctures to Membriko EPDM lining arising from accidental mechanical damage are repaired using Membriko EPDM patch repair systems. In dry conditions, a self-adhesive EPDM patch is bonded over the damaged area, with a minimum 75 mm overlap around the puncture on all sides. For emergency repair of flooded tanks where draining and drying is not immediately practical, Membriko uses immersion-grade EPDM adhesive systems that can be applied underwater to restore watertightness until a scheduled dry repair can be completed.

**Precautions During Maintenance Operations**

Membriko advises ETAR facility operators on precautions required during maintenance activities in lined tanks and lagoons: heavy wheeled or tracked plant must not operate directly on EPDM membrane without protective boards; grit blasting of adjacent structures is masked to prevent abrasive contamination of the membrane surface; and open-flame cutting or grinding near the membrane perimeter is masked to prevent spark contact with the EPDM.

**Maintenance Records**

Membriko recommends that a photographic inspection record is maintained from project handover, with each annual inspection record filed against the fixed inspection point references established in the Membriko as-built documentation. This record provides the evidence base for warranty claims during the 20-year Membriko installation warranty period and for ERSAR asset management reporting by regulated water utilities.

## Section 11: Regulatory Framework — ERSAR, APA, and Portuguese Water Law

Membriko works within the Portuguese water and wastewater regulatory framework and provides its clients with the documentation necessary to support environmental licensing, regulatory compliance, and utility asset management requirements.

**ERSAR — Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos**

ERSAR is the independent regulatory authority for water supply and wastewater services in Portugal. It publishes annual quality of service assessments evaluating regulated utilities against a comprehensive set of performance indicators, including treatment quality, compliance with discharge consent conditions, and operational effectiveness of ETAR infrastructure. ERSAR's quality of service indicators are publicly available and directly visible to municipal shareholders of regulated utilities, creating strong incentives for asset management decisions that maintain and improve ETAR performance.

Membriko EPDM systems support utilities in maintaining ERSAR performance ratings by providing reliable, permanent containment that reduces the risk of ETAR incidents — containment failures, odour complaints, and groundwater contamination events — that would be reflected in adverse ERSAR performance assessments. Membriko's project documentation, including CE certificates and hydraulic acceptance test records, supports the asset register and asset condition records that ERSAR expects regulated utilities to maintain.

**APA — Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente**

APA is the environmental permitting authority for wastewater treatment in Portugal. It issues environmental licences and discharge consents under Decreto-Lei 152/97 (transposing Directive 91/271/EEC, the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive) and monitors compliance with discharge limit values for BOD₅, COD, suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and microbiological parameters as specified in Decreto-Lei 236/98. APA enforces these requirements through inspection and, where necessary, administrative sanctions.

Membriko EPDM-lined lagoons and tanks prevent the groundwater contamination and surface water pollution incidents that would trigger APA enforcement action and risk licence suspension. For new ETAR construction projects, the membrane lining specification forms part of the environmental licence application; Membriko provides CE-marked membrane data sheets, Declaration of Performance documents, and installation method statements as part of the technical dossier submitted to APA.

**Decreto-Lei 152/97 and Decreto-Lei 236/98**

Decreto-Lei 152/97 sets minimum treatment standards for urban wastewater by agglomeration size and specifies more stringent treatment for discharges to sensitive receiving water bodies. Decreto-Lei 236/98 establishes quality objectives for receiving water bodies that set the environmental standard ETAR discharge must meet. These regulations create the mandatory compliance framework within which ETAR lining investment decisions are made. An ETAR with failing containment that allows untreated wastewater to contaminate groundwater or surface water bodies may breach the conditions of its APA licence. The reliable containment provided by Membriko EPDM systems is, in this regulatory context, not an optional upgrade — it is a compliance obligation.

## Section 12: The EU Urban Wastewater Directive Recast — Investment Implications for Portugal

The recast Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (EU) 2022/1072, adopted in June 2022 and entering into force progressively through 2033 to 2045, represents the most significant revision of EU wastewater treatment policy in thirty years. Its implications for Portuguese ETAR infrastructure investment are substantial.

**Energy Neutrality by 2040**

The recast Directive requires large ETARs — those serving populations above 10,000 PE — to achieve a balance between energy generated on-site and energy consumed in treatment operations by 2040. The pathway to energy neutrality for most medium and large ETARs runs through anaerobic sludge digestion and biogas recovery. A fully equipped ETAR with digestion and combined heat and power (CHP) can achieve 60 to 80% reduction in net energy consumption relative to a facility without digestion.

Membriko EPDM digester covers are the enabling component for biogas recovery. Without a gas-tight cover over the anaerobic digester, biogas is released to atmosphere — wasting energy and emitting greenhouse gases. A Membriko floating gas-holder cover converts the digester from a point source of methane emissions to a recoverable energy resource. For Portuguese utilities with existing digesters but no gas collection capability, retrofitting Membriko EPDM floating covers is a practical, cost-effective pathway towards energy neutrality compliance.

**Quaternary Treatment for Large Discharges**

The recast Directive introduces mandatory removal of micro-pollutants — pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial chemicals — from significant discharges to water bodies. Installations serving agglomerations above 150,000 PE must achieve micro-pollutant removal by 2033; those above 100,000 PE by 2039. Quaternary treatment typically requires dedicated treatment tanks using advanced oxidation processes or activated carbon adsorption. These new treatment stages represent significant infrastructure investment — new tanks and contactors that will require Membriko EPDM lining as part of their construction specification.

**Portuguese Implementation Timeline**

Transposition of the recast Directive into Portuguese law is expected by mid-2026. APA will publish the implementation plan identifying the facilities subject to each compliance milestone. For ETAR asset managers making capital planning decisions now, the recast Directive provides legally binding justification for investment in facility upgrades through 2025 to 2045. Membriko EPDM systems, with a 50-year service life, provide the containment infrastructure that makes this investment sustainable over the full compliance timeline.

**Tourism Sector and Coastal ETAR Upgrades**

Portugal's Mediterranean coast and the Algarve region face a specific infrastructure challenge: wastewater treatment capacity designed for permanent resident populations must accommodate peak tourism season populations that can be three to five times higher than the year-round baseline. Seasonal overloading of coastal ETARs has historically caused discharge consent breaches during summer peak periods — precisely when bathing water quality at coastal beaches is under maximum scrutiny by the European Environment Agency's annual bathing water monitoring programme.

The recast Directive's strengthened discharge standards and monitoring requirements will increase regulatory pressure on coastal utility operators to ensure treatment capacity is adequate for peak season loading. Membrane lining of stabilisation lagoons, constructed wetland systems, and settling ponds — all supplied and installed by Membriko — contributes to treatment reliability by ensuring hydraulic containment is maintained under peak load conditions, preventing the short-circuiting that can compromise treatment performance in overloaded facilities. Membriko works with coastal utility operators and engineering consultancies in the Algarve, Alentejo Litoral, and west coast regions on ETAR rehabilitation and capacity upgrade projects.

## Section 13: Environmental Contribution — Groundwater Protection, Biogas Recovery, and Sustainability

EPDM membrane lining in wastewater treatment infrastructure, supplied and installed by Membriko, contributes to environmental protection objectives across multiple dimensions that align with the sustainability frameworks increasingly required in Portuguese public procurement and EU-funded infrastructure investment.

**Groundwater Protection in a Water-Stressed Country**

Portugal operates under Mediterranean climate conditions characterised by severe seasonal drought, declining groundwater recharge rates, and growing pressure on aquifer resources from agricultural, municipal, and tourism demand. Groundwater is the primary drinking water source for many rural communities in central and southern Portugal. Contamination of shallow aquifers by seepage from unlined or inadequately lined wastewater lagoons and tanks represents a direct and long-lasting threat to drinking water quality — unlike surface water contamination, which is relatively short-lived, groundwater contamination from a leaking ETAR lagoon can persist for decades after the source is remediated.

A properly installed Membriko EPDM lining system eliminates seepage from wastewater infrastructure, providing permanent isolation of the treatment process from the surrounding groundwater environment. The leak-tightness of the system is demonstrated at installation by the Membriko hydraulic acceptance test and confirmed over time by the 50-year service life projection that Membriko supports with a 20-year installation warranty.

**Biogas Recovery and Carbon Reduction**

Anaerobic digestion with biogas recovery, enabled by Membriko EPDM digester covers, contributes directly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment. Methane (CH₄) has a global warming potential approximately 28 times that of CO₂ over a 100-year horizon. Uncontrolled release of biogas from uncovered anaerobic digesters represents a significant and avoidable source of methane emissions. Collecting digester biogas and converting it to electricity and heat through CHP not only eliminates the methane emission but displaces carbon-intensive grid electricity, creating a double carbon benefit for participating utilities.

For a municipal ETAR serving 10,000 PE with full sludge digestion and biogas recovery via Membriko digester covers, the annual energy output from a CHP system can represent a reduction of several hundred tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in annual greenhouse gas emissions relative to an uncovered digester.

**Lifecycle Carbon Advantage Over Alternative Systems**

The 50-year service life of Membriko EPDM dramatically improves its lifecycle carbon performance relative to alternative lining systems. An epoxy coating system reapplied every seven to ten years over a 50-year period requires five to seven recoating cycles, each involving production and transport of coating materials, specialist applicator mobilisation, surface preparation, application, and curing. The cumulative embodied carbon of these cycles substantially exceeds the once-installed carbon of a Membriko EPDM system over the same period. Portuguese public procurement under EU cohesion fund programmes increasingly includes lifecycle carbon assessment as a criterion for infrastructure investment decisions, and Membriko EPDM systems perform well under lifecycle analysis frameworks precisely because of their long service life and minimal maintenance requirement.

**End-of-Life Recyclability**

EPDM membranes at end of service life can be recovered, granulated, and used as recycled rubber in sports surface underlays, road asphalt modifiers, and civil engineering drainage composites. Several EPDM membrane manufacturers operate take-back programmes for end-of-life materials. Membriko can advise clients on the disposal and recycling options available at the end of the membrane's service life.

**Contribution to the Water Framework Directive**

Portugal's obligations under the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) include achieving good ecological and chemical status for surface water bodies and good quantitative and qualitative status for groundwater. ETARs with reliable, permanent containment — provided by Membriko EPDM systems — reduce diffuse pollutant loads to Portuguese water bodies, contributing to the ecological quality objectives of the Water Framework Directive. Conversely, containment failures at ETAR lagoons and tanks are a direct source of Water Framework Directive non-compliance that can attract European Commission infringement proceedings.

## Section 14: Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Is Membriko EPDM certified to European standards for geosynthetic barriers used in wastewater containment?**

Yes. Membriko specifies EPDM geomembranes conforming to EN 13491 with CE marking under EN 13956 (flexible waterproofing sheets — polymer and rubber) and EN 13361 (geosynthetic barriers for use in the construction of reservoirs and dams). EN 13361 is the specific European standard for geosynthetic barriers used in liquid retention applications, which includes wastewater lagoons, clarifiers, and digester lining. These certifications form the basis for regulatory acceptance of Membriko membrane systems in Portuguese ETAR environmental licensing files and public procurement documentation. A full Declaration of Performance and CE certificate is provided with every Membriko EPDM installation.

**2. What EPDM thickness does Membriko recommend for anaerobic digesters with high H₂S concentrations?**

Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM for digester wall and floor lining in primary and secondary anaerobic digesters. For floating digester covers exposed to H₂S atmosphere on the internal face and to UV and weather on the external face, 1.5 mm reinforced EPDM is standard. It is important to note that chemical resistance to hydrogen sulphide and biogenic sulphuric acid in EPDM is not thickness-dependent — it is a property of the polymer chemistry, and all Membriko EPDM thicknesses provide complete resistance at all H₂S concentrations encountered in wastewater treatment. Thickness specification in ETAR applications is driven by mechanical requirements: hydrostatic pressure rating, abrasion resistance during maintenance, and the structural demands of the specific application.

**3. Can EPDM withstand the temperatures inside thermophilic anaerobic digesters operating at 50 to 55°C?**

Yes. Membriko EPDM's continuous service temperature in immersion is rated to 90°C — well above the 50 to 55°C operating temperature of thermophilic digesters. The polymer remains fully elastic and chemically resistant throughout the thermophilic operating range. Membriko's specification includes substantial safety margin: even if digester temperatures briefly exceed normal operating conditions during process upsets, EPDM's thermal envelope accommodates excursions to significantly higher temperatures without permanent damage to the membrane. Solar heating of stabilisation lagoon surface water in the Algarve and Alentejo regions can temporarily raise surface temperatures to 35 to 40°C in summer — well within EPDM's comfortable service range.

**4. How are field seams formed in large lagoon installations — self-adhesive tape or contact adhesive welding?**

Membriko uses both methods, selected according to project conditions and specification. Self-adhesive QuickSeam lap tape — a solvent-activated contact bonding system specifically designed for EPDM-to-EPDM seaming — is the standard Membriko field seaming method for the majority of lagoon and tank lining projects. It achieves seam strengths at or above 80% of the membrane tensile strength when applied correctly and is robust in typical Portuguese ETAR site conditions. Hot-air fusion welding is used for applications where the project engineer specifies factory-grade seam performance, or where pressurised containment conditions demand the highest available seam strength. All Membriko seams, regardless of method, are tested by vacuum box or spark test before the installation proceeds to the hydraulic acceptance test.

**5. Does Membriko have experience with municipal and agro-industrial ETAR projects in Portugal?**

Yes. Membriko, based in Pombal, Leiria, has installed EPDM lining and cover systems at municipal ETAR facilities across the centre and north of Portugal, including stabilisation lagoon lining, anaerobic digester floating cover systems, clarifier rehabilitation, and constructed wetland reed bed installations. Membriko also works directly with agro-industrial clients — wineries, olive oil mills, dairy processors, and livestock operations — that operate on-site effluent treatment facilities subject to APA discharge consent requirements. Technical references from completed projects are available upon request for qualified project teams and engineering consultancies. Membriko is available for site surveys and technical consultations across all Portuguese regions.

**6. Does rehabilitation lining of an existing lagoon require complete emptying and drying before Membriko can install EPDM?**

For a full floor and wall lining installation in an existing lagoon, yes — the lagoon must be emptied, cleaned to remove sludge deposits, and dried to the residual moisture level required for bonded lining installation. Applying a bonded Membriko EPDM system to wet or contaminated surfaces risks adhesion failure at the substrate interface, so this is a firm substrate preparation requirement. For the rehabilitation of existing lagoons with localised HDPE or PVC liner damage, emergency repairs using immersion-grade EPDM adhesive systems can be made at reduced lagoon level in some cases, restoring temporary watertightness until the facility can be taken out of service for full rehabilitation. Membriko plans rehabilitation projects in consultation with the facility operator to minimise treatment capacity interruption, including the use of temporary bypass pumping and phased shutdown of multi-cell lagoon systems.

**7. Is EPDM suitable for floating gas-holder covers on anaerobic digesters used for biogas collection and energy recovery?**

Yes, and EPDM is the most widely used material for this application in European biogas facilities. Membriko designs and installs double-membrane floating gas-holder covers for anaerobic digesters used in both municipal ETAR sludge treatment and in agricultural co-digestion facilities. The inner EPDM membrane collects biogas from the digester liquid surface and contains it in the space between the inner and outer membranes; the outer Membriko EPDM membrane provides UV and weather protection and contains wind loading. Blowers extract gas from the inter-membrane space to the CHP engine or gas upgrading system. EPDM is fully resistant to all biogas components — methane, CO₂, H₂S, ammonia, and organic vapours — at digester operating temperatures and pressures. Membriko sizes floating gas-holder covers for digester volumes from 500 m³ to 5,000 m³ and coordinates the cover design with the biogas utilisation system supplier.

**8. What warranty does Membriko provide for EPDM systems installed at wastewater treatment works?**

Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty on all EPDM lining and cover systems installed at ETAR facilities. This warranty is supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product warranty (covering the EPDM material against defects in manufacture) and to the five-year statutory defects liability period applicable to construction works under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Article 1225). For public procurement projects — Concursos Públicos and procedures under the Código dos Contratos Públicos — Membriko provides insurance-backed warranty instruments, including performance bonds and warranty bonds, as required by the procurement documentation. The Membriko warranty certificate, together with the full technical documentation package (CE certificates, Declaration of Performance, seam test records, hydraulic acceptance test record, and photographic as-built documentation), is delivered at project handover and forms part of the facility's regulatory compliance file.
