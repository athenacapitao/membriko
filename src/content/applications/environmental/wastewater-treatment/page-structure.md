# Wastewater Treatment (ETAR) — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

The ETAR page serves two primary professional audiences who have fundamentally different
decision-making frameworks:

1. **Municipal engineers and project managers** at water utilities (AdP subsidiaries, empresas
   municipais, serviços municipalizados) who specify membrane systems for new construction and
   rehabilitation projects. They require technical depth, standards references, and regulatory
   alignment. They will read the comparison table, specifications, and regulatory section closely.

2. **Environmental and civil engineers in private consultancy** designing new ETARs or
   rehabilitation projects for public procurement. They need specification-grade data and
   documented compliance with Portuguese and EU regulations.

A secondary audience includes:
- Agro-industrial facility managers (dairy, winery, olive oil, slaughterhouse) with on-site
  effluent treatment requirements
- Environmental consultants advising rural municipalities on small ETAR construction
- Architects and project teams working on industrial park developments with effluent treatment

The content architecture must establish immediate technical credibility: this audience is
sceptical and will dismiss vague marketing language immediately. Every claim must be
traceable to standards, data, or documented field experience. The persuasion arc is:
understand the chemical environment — present EPDM's intrinsic chemistry as the only rational
response — document facility type coverage — compare against competing systems honestly —
address covers and odour as a complete solution — provide regulatory framing — close with
the Membriko service proposition.

The Portuguese wastewater sector context (ERSAR, APA, AdP, EU UWWTD recast) humanises the
regulatory landscape and positions Membriko as a technically informed partner, not a generic
membrane supplier.

## Section 1: Introduction — The Portuguese Wastewater Infrastructure Challenge

**Purpose:** Establish the scale, urgency and technical challenge of ETAR lining and frame
Membriko as the specialist supplier for this demanding environment.

**Content:**
- Portugal's ETAR network: approximately 3,800 facilities, many dating from the 1990s expansion
  funded by EU Cohesion Fund (FEDER); significant proportion now requiring rehabilitation as
  concrete structures reach 25-35 year mark with biogenic acid corrosion damage
- The regulatory driver: EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive recast (2022/1072) requiring
  progressive upgrades through 2035-2045; APA discharge consent requirements under Decreto-Lei
  152/97; ERSAR performance monitoring
- The chemical challenge: H₂S, biogenic sulphuric acid, ammonia, organic acids — the most
  aggressive chemical environment for any building material
- The Membriko answer: EPDM geomembrane systems specified for ETAR applications; 50+ year
  service life against a chemical environment that destroys concrete in 15-20 years
- Stat block: 50+ year service life / 300-500% elongation / complete resistance to H₂S,
  H₂SO₄ and NH₃ / 20-year Membriko installation warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Proposta para ETAR"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for ETAR — Chemistry of Resistance

**Purpose:** Establish technical credibility through the chemistry argument. This audience
will not accept general performance claims without mechanism.

**Content:**
- The three principal chemical threats in wastewater treatment and EPDM's specific response
  to each: H₂S / biogenic H₂SO₄ (saturated backbone, no acid-reactive sites), ammonia
  (inert to amine attack), chlorine in tertiary treatment (same resistance as pool applications)
- Biogenic acid corrosion (BAC) mechanism and why it destroys concrete but not EPDM
- ASTM D471 data: EPDM in 40% H₂SO₄ at 70°C — no measurable change; EPDM in 200 ppm NaOCl
  — no measurable change; EPDM in concentrated NH₃ — no measurable change
- Data table:

  | Property | Value | Standard |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness (standard wastewater) | 1.5 mm — 2.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 300% | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | H₂SO₄ resistance (40%) | No degradation | ASTM D471 |
  | NaOCl resistance (200 ppm) | No degradation | ASTM D471 |
  | NH₃ resistance (concentrated) | No degradation | ASTM D471 |
  | UV resistance | No cracking at 2,000 hours | EN ISO 4892-3 |
  | Root resistance | Pass | EN 13948 |
  | Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ/Arrhenius |

- CE marking per EN 13956 and EN 13361 (geosynthetic barriers)

## Section 3: Facility Types — Where EPDM Is Applied in ETARs

**Purpose:** Demonstrate comprehensive coverage of the ETAR facility type spectrum, including
less-common applications that differentiate Membriko.

**Content:** Six facility type cards.

**Lagoas de Estabilização (Stabilisation Lagoons)**
- Context: used in small municipal ETARs across rural Portugal and in agro-industrial treatment;
  unlined lagoons risk groundwater contamination; biogenic processes generate odour
- EPDM benefit: large-format sheets up to 15.25 m wide minimise seams; UV-stable for open
  surface; root-resistant at lagoon margins; EN 13361 compliance for regulatory acceptance

**Digestores Anaeróbios (Anaerobic Digesters)**
- Context: primary and secondary digesters at larger ETARs; also agricultural biogas plants
  (UTBR — Unidades de Tratamento de Bioresíduos); highest chemical aggressiveness in ETAR
- EPDM benefit: floating covers and fixed dome covers in EPDM; wall lining in digesters;
  gas collection bladders; full resistance to biogas components (CH₄, CO₂, H₂S, NH₃)

**Decantadores Primários e Secundários (Clarifiers)**
- Context: circular or rectangular tanks subject to biogenic acid corrosion; concrete walls
  typically fail within 15-25 years in anaerobic contact zones
- EPDM benefit: full-surface lining protects concrete indefinitely; installed in new clarifiers
  and in rehabilitation of corroded concrete; 2.0 mm EPDM rated for submerged and splash
  zone conditions

**Tanques SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactors)**
- Context: SBR tanks alternate aerobic/anoxic cycles; cyclic loading stresses rigid liners;
  aeration equipment creates vibration
- EPDM benefit: elastomeric recovery from cyclic strain; 400%+ elongation accommodates dynamic
  loads; bonded lining prevents fatigue failure at stress concentrations

**Leitos de Juncos e Filtros de Macrófitas (Constructed Wetland Systems)**
- Context: used in rural Portugal for small and medium ETAR tertiary treatment; reed bed basins
  must contain effluent and prevent groundwater infiltration; Phragmites roots penetrate
  inadequate liner materials
- EPDM benefit: root resistance per EN 13948; UV resistance in open surface application;
  flexibility accommodates gravel loading on liner; standard for constructed wetland design

**Lagoas de Lamas e Leitos de Secagem (Sludge Lagoons and Drying Beds)**
- Context: sludge storage and dewatering; high ammonia and H₂S concentrations; partial
  cover systems for odour management
- EPDM benefit: full NH₃ and H₂S resistance; EPDM cover panels for odour containment;
  compatible with mechanical and solar drying equipment

---

## Section 4: Chemical Resistance — H₂S, Biogenic Acid, Ammonia and Chlorine

**Purpose:** The technical core of the page — explain in precise terms why EPDM resists
the specific chemicals present in wastewater treatment.

**Content:**
- Biogenic acid corrosion (BAC) mechanism in full: SRB bacteria → H₂S → oxidation at
  concrete surface → H₂SO₄ → calcium aluminate attack → concrete disintegration; rate data
  (5-10 mm/year in severe conditions); comparison of BAC impact on concrete vs EPDM
- H₂S resistance: EPDM backbone has no sulphide-reactive sites; ASTM D471 data at elevated
  H₂S concentrations; comparison with HDPE and PVC
- H₂SO₄ resistance: EPDM stable across 0-40% concentration; comparison with concrete coating
  systems (epoxy rating: good but fails at cracks; PVC: moderate)
- NH₃ resistance: EPDM inert to ammonia at all wastewater concentrations; relevant for
  digesters and sludge lagoons with 2,000-5,000 mg/L NH₄⁺
- Chlorine / NaOCl resistance: relevant for tertiary disinfection contact tanks; same
  mechanism as pool applications — saturated backbone, no plasticisers
- UV resistance in open lagoons: 2,000-hour xenon arc test data; 30-year field data from
  European lagoon installations

---

## Section 5: Installation Process (7 Steps)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate systematic, professional installation methodology for technically
demanding ETAR applications.

**Content:** Numbered process.

1. **Levantamento e Diagnóstico Técnico** — Site survey: structural assessment of existing
   tanks or lagoon substrate; sampling of concrete for BAC damage; geotechnical assessment
   of lagoon subgrade; inventory of penetrations, pipework, and equipment interfaces
2. **Projecto de Membrana e Layout de Corte** — Membrane specification (thickness, grade);
   layout plan minimising seams and positioning them at accessible locations; penetration
   schedule; specification of prefabricated corner pieces, flanged penetrations, and
   termination profiles
3. **Preparação da Estrutura** — Concrete repair and surface preparation; HDPE drain layer
   installation where required (to manage uplift pressure); anchor trench excavation for
   lagoon perimeters; surface planarity verification
4. **Instalação da Membrana** — Membrane placement; bonded or mechanical attachment depending
   on application; seaming with factory-grade seam tape (QuickSeam) or hot-air welding for
   large industrial applications
5. **Execução de Pontos Singulares** — Penetration sleeves; flanged EPDM pipe boots; wall
   termination bars; gas extraction fitting seals on digester covers; floating cover edge
   seals and ballast chains
6. **Inspecção e Ensaio de Estanquidade** — Visual inspection of all seams; spark test or
   vacuum box test on seams; hydraulic fill test with 72-hour monitoring; photographic
   as-built record
7. **Garantia e Documentação** — 20-year Membriko installation warranty; CE documentation
   for the membrane supplied; inspection report for regulatory file; maintenance protocol

---

## Section 6: Rehabilitation of Existing ETARs

**Purpose:** Address the large rehabilitation market — ETARs with failing concrete that need
membrane lining to restore containment and extend service life.

**Content:**
- The rehabilitation case: Portuguese ETAR infrastructure built in the 1990s is reaching the
  end of its concrete service life due to BAC; alternatives are concrete demolition and
  reconstruction (expensive, requires extended facility shutdown), surface coating (5-10 year
  solution, not a permanent fix), or EPDM lining (permanent, 50+ year solution)
- What EPDM can be installed over: corroded concrete (after repair of structural damage);
  existing epoxy coating (after mechanical keying if sound); HDPE geomembrane (if still
  present and structurally intact)
- What requires remediation first: active structural cracks (polyurethane injection before
  lining); delaminated concrete (removal and mortar repair); failed coatings (mechanical
  removal to sound substrate)
- Process note: rehabilitation installation in tanks typically requires facility shutdown
  of 5-15 working days depending on tank size; lagoon rehabilitation can be phased to
  maintain partial treatment capacity
- Regulatory note: EPDM rehabilitation lining may require notification to APA if changes
  to the facility affect the discharge consent conditions; Membriko can provide technical
  documentation to support regulatory submissions

---

## Section 7: EPDM Odour Containment Covers

**Purpose:** Present the cover system as a complete ETAR solution, not just tank lining —
differentiating Membriko from suppliers offering only geomembrane.

**Content:**
- Why odour management is critical: H₂S threshold of perception is 0.001 ppm — even very
  low concentrations cause complaints; ETARs near residential areas face mounting regulatory
  and community pressure; APA licensing increasingly requires odour management plans
- EPDM floating covers for clarifiers and sludge tanks: how they work (membrane floats on
  liquid surface, gas extracted by blower); design features (perimeter seal, drainage gutter,
  gas extraction fitting, access hatch with EPDM seal); materials (1.5-2.0 mm reinforced EPDM)
- EPDM fixed covers for inlet works and screening areas: lighter-duty structure, usually
  supported on a framework; EPDM provides chemical resistance to condensate acids
- Digester covers for gas collection and odour containment: EPDM single-membrane and double-
  membrane systems for biogas collection; compatibility with biogas utilisation equipment
- Integration with odour treatment systems: biofilter, bioscrubber, chemical scrubber, or
  RTO (regenerative thermal oxidiser) — Membriko coordinates cover gas extraction with
  downstream treatment system suppliers

## Section 8: EPDM vs HDPE, PVC, Concrete Coatings and Epoxy

**Purpose:** Technical comparison for engineers who will evaluate multiple systems. Framed
as objective analysis with honest acknowledgement of where alternatives perform well.

**Content:** Comparison table.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | PVC Geomembrane | Epoxy Coating | Concrete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service life | 50+ years | 25-35 years | 8-15 years | 5-10 years | 10-20 years (with BAC) |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 300-400% | 12-18% | 200-300% | 0-5% | 0% |
| H₂SO₄ resistance | Excellent | Good | Moderate | Good (intact) | Fails — BAC mechanism |
| NH₃ resistance | Excellent | Excellent | Moderate (plasticiser) | Good | Moderate |
| UV resistance | Excellent — intrinsic | Good (stabiliser) | Poor without additives | Moderate | Good |
| Stress cracking | Not applicable | Failure mode | Not applicable | Crack bridging: none | Failure mode |
| Cold flexibility | Excellent (-45°C) | Brittle below +5°C | Good | Brittle | Good |
| Seam method | Self-adhesive tape / contact adhesive | Hot-wedge fusion weld | Solvent / heat | Liquid applied | Concrete joint |
| Root resistance | Excellent (EN 13948) | Good | Poor | None | None |

Honest acknowledgement: HDPE geomembranes are appropriate for large lagoons with minimal
penetrations and regular geometry where long straight fusion welds can be made mechanically.
Epoxy coating systems are appropriate for surfaces with no structural cracking where the
coating can be maintained through periodic reapplication. Membriko's recommendation is
EPDM where permanence, chemical resistance across all wastewater chemicals, and zero-
maintenance containment are the design objectives.

## Section 10: Maintenance

**Purpose:** Demonstrate minimal maintenance requirement as a lifecycle cost argument.

**Content:**
- Routine inspection: annual visual inspection of membrane surface, seams, perimeter
  terminations and penetrations; inspection of lagoon berm for erosion that could expose
  anchor trench
- Cleaning: pressure washing at up to 150 bar; biological fouling (algae, biofilm) on
  EPDM surfaces does not indicate membrane degradation and can be removed by pressure
  washing or chemical treatment (NaOCl solution)
- Repair of punctures: EPDM patch repair using self-adhesive EPDM tape or contact adhesive
  bonding in dry conditions; emergency underwater repair with immersion-grade EPDM adhesive
  for flooded tanks where rapid repair is required
- What to avoid: heavy mechanical equipment directly on the membrane without protective
  boards; abrasive grit blasting adjacent to installed membrane; open-flame cutting near
  the membrane perimeter
- Maintenance record: Membriko recommends keeping a photographic inspection record from
  installation as-built through each annual inspection, referenced to fixed inspection points

---

## Section 11: Portuguese Water Regulations (ERSAR and APA)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate regulatory literacy and help the professional client navigate
compliance requirements.

**Content:**
- ERSAR (Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos): the independent regulatory
  authority for water supply and wastewater services in Portugal; annual performance assessment
  of utilities; quality of service indicators include ETAR operation quality and compliance
  with discharge consent conditions; Membriko EPDM systems support utilities in maintaining
  ERSAR performance ratings
- APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente): issues environmental licensing for ETARs; discharge
  consents under Decreto-Lei 152/97 and Decreto-Lei 236/98; monitoring compliance with
  discharge limit values (DLV) for BOD, COD, suspended solids, nutrients, and microbiological
  parameters; EPDM-lined lagoons and tanks prevent groundwater contamination that would trigger
  APA enforcement
- Decreto-Lei 152/97 (transposing Directive 91/271/EEC): minimum treatment requirements
  for urban wastewater by agglomeration size; discharge standards for sensitive and normal
  receiving water bodies
- Decreto-Lei 236/98: quality objectives for water bodies (freshwater, coastal, transitional);
  sets the environmental standard that ETAR discharge must meet
- Licensing documentation: Membriko provides CE-marked membrane data sheets, seam testing
  records, and installation as-built documentation to support environmental licensing files

---

## Section 12: EU Urban Wastewater Directive — Recast 2022/1072

**Purpose:** Position Membriko as aware of the strategic direction of EU wastewater policy
and the investment it will drive in Portuguese ETAR infrastructure.

**Content:**
- The original Directive (91/271/EEC) and its achievements in Portugal: urban wastewater
  collection rate increased from approximately 55% in 1993 to 88%+ by 2023; significant ETAR
  network built with EU cohesion funding
- The recast Directive (EU) 2022/1072 — key new obligations:
  - Energy neutrality: large ETARs (> 10,000 PE) must achieve energy balance by 2040; drives
    anaerobic digestion and biogas recovery where EPDM digester covers are key components
  - Quaternary treatment: micro-pollutant removal (pharmaceuticals, personal care products)
    for discharges from agglomerations > 150,000 PE from 2033 (100,000 PE from 2039) —
    new treatment tanks requiring lining
  - Extended producer responsibility: pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries will fund
    quaternary treatment costs — major construction investment trigger
  - Digital monitoring: real-time sensor monitoring requirements; new infrastructure supporting
    upgraded treatment
- Portuguese implementation timeline: transposition into national law expected by mid-2026;
  implementation plan coordinated by APA
- For ETAR asset managers: the recast Directive means substantial investment in treatment
  infrastructure through 2030-2045; Membriko EPDM systems provide the 50-year containment
  foundation that makes this investment sustainable

---

## Section 13: Environmental Impact

**Purpose:** Contextualise EPDM wastewater lining within sustainability frameworks that
are increasingly important to public procurement and engineering specification.

**Content:**
- Groundwater protection: properly lined lagoons and tanks prevent seepage of wastewater
  constituents (nitrogen, phosphorus, pathogens, micro-pollutants) to groundwater; critical
  in Portugal's Mediterranean climate context where groundwater is a primary drinking water
  source in rural areas
- Surface water quality: preventing ETAR containment failures protects receiving water bodies
  from environmental incidents; EPDM's 50-year containment reliability reduces the probability
  of catastrophic liner failure compared to shorter-lived systems
- Biogas recovery enabled by EPDM covers: collecting digester biogas for CHP (combined heat
  and power) or biomethane injection reduces ETAR carbon footprint; a 10,000 PE ETAR with
  full sludge digestion and biogas recovery can achieve energy neutrality
- Embodied carbon comparison: EPDM system installed once for 50+ years vs. epoxy coating
  reapplied every 7-10 years — lifecycle embodied carbon of EPDM is substantially lower
- End-of-life recyclability: EPDM membranes can be recovered at end of service and granulated
  for use in rubber products, road surfacing, and civil engineering applications
- Water cycle contribution: ETARs operating with reliable containment reduce the pollutant
  load to Portugal's water bodies, contributing to the ecological quality objectives of the
  Water Framework Directive (EU 2000/60/EC)

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture specific technical and procedural questions from the professional
engineering audience.

1. **A membrana EPDM é certificada segundo as normas europeias para barreiras geossintéticas?**
   Yes. Membriko specifies EPDM geomembranes with CE marking under EN 13956 (flexible
   waterproofing sheets) and EN 13361 (geosynthetic barriers for liquid retention). These
   certifications are the reference standards for regulatory acceptance of membrane lining
   systems in ETARs in Portugal and across the EU.

2. **Qual a espessura de EPDM recomendada para digestores anaeróbios com H₂S elevado?**
   For anaerobic digesters with significant H₂S concentrations, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm
   EPDM for wall and floor lining. For floating digester covers exposed to both H₂S
   atmosphere and outdoor UV, 1.5 mm reinforced EPDM is standard. Chemical resistance of
   EPDM to H₂S is not thickness-dependent — all thicknesses provide complete resistance.
   Thickness specification is driven by mechanical durability and service life requirements.

3. **O EPDM aguenta a temperatura de digestores termofílicos (55°C)?**
   Yes. EPDM's continuous service temperature in immersion is rated to +90°C — well above
   thermophilic digester operating temperatures of 50-55°C. Even at peak temperatures in
   solar-heated lagoons in the Algarve summer (up to 35-40°C at the surface), EPDM is
   well within its service envelope.

4. **Como se faz a emenda de EPDM em grandes lagoas — solda a quente ou fita de colagem?**
   For large lagoon installations, Membriko uses both methods depending on project conditions.
   Self-adhesive QuickSeam tape (solvent-activated bonding) is standard for most field
   seaming. Hot-air fusion welding is used where factory-quality seam strength is required
   (e.g. pressurised containment) or specified by the project engineer. All seams are
   tested by vacuum box or spark test before hydraulic acceptance.

5. **A Membriko tem experiência em ETARs municipais e industriais em Portugal?**
   Yes. Membriko has installed EPDM lining systems in municipal ETAR lagoons, anaerobic
   digesters, clarifiers and constructed wetland systems across the centre and north of
   Portugal. We also work with agro-industrial clients in the dairy, winery and livestock
   sectors with on-site effluent treatment requirements. Technical references are available
   upon request for qualified project teams.

6. **A instalação de EPDM numa lagoa existente requer esvaziamento total?**
   For full floor and wall lining of an existing lagoon, yes — the lagoon must be emptied,
   cleaned and dried before membrane installation. For partial rehabilitation of an existing
   HDPE or PVC liner with local damage, emergency repairs can be made with the lagoon at
   reduced level. Membriko plans rehabilitation programmes to minimise treatment capacity
   interruption, including phased lagoon shutdown where parallel treatment capacity exists.

7. **O EPDM é adequado para a cobertura flutuante de um digestor para captação de biogás?**
   Yes. EPDM is the most widely used material for floating gas holders on anaerobic digesters
   in Europe. The membrane is resistant to all biogas components (methane, CO₂, H₂S, ammonia).
   For gas collection efficiency, a double-membrane floating cover design is used, with an
   inner gas-collection membrane and an outer protective membrane. Membriko designs floating
   cover systems for digester capacities from 500 m³ to 5,000 m³.

8. **Qual a garantia da Membriko para instalações em ETARs?**
   Membriko provides a 20-year installation warranty on all ETAR lining and cover systems,
   supplementary to the membrane manufacturer's product warranty and to the 5-year statutory
   defects liability period under the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil, Art. 1225).
   For public procurement projects, Membriko can provide insurance-backed warranty instruments
   (performance bonds, warranty bonds) as required by the procurement documentation. The
   warranty certificate and supporting technical documentation are delivered at project handover.
