# Wastewater Treatment (ETAR) — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM in Wastewater Treatment: Core Chemistry and Relevance

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is uniquely suited to wastewater treatment infrastructure
because its chemical resistance is intrinsic to its polymer architecture, not dependent on
sacrificial coatings or additives that degrade over time. The saturated carbon-carbon backbone
of the EPDM polymer chain is chemically inert to the principal aggressive agents present in
wastewater environments: hydrogen sulphide (H₂S), biogenic sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄), ammonia
(NH₃), chlorine (used in tertiary disinfection), and UV radiation in open lagoon systems.

Standard wastewater-grade EPDM membranes are formulated with:
- Ethylene content: 55-70% molar (optimised for mechanical strength and low-temperature flexibility)
- ENB (ethylidene norbornene) diene content: 3-6% molar (cross-linking sites for vulcanisation)
- Carbon black loading: 35-55 phr (UV absorber, mechanical reinforcement, and chemical inertness)
- Antioxidant packages selected for continuous immersion in biologically active environments

Key physical properties of wastewater-grade EPDM:
- Service temperature range: -45°C to +130°C (continuous immersion rated to +90°C)
- Elongation at break: 300-500% (typical EPDM geomembrane production)
- Tensile strength: 9-14 N/mm² depending on formulation and thickness
- Water absorption: < 1% by weight (ASTM D471)
- Hardness: 55-70 Shore A
- Thickness for wastewater applications: 1.0 mm (secondary containment), 1.5 mm (aeration
  lagoons, reed bed systems), 2.0 mm (primary treatment, digesters, sludge lagoons), 2.5 mm
  (high-load industrial effluent and anaerobic digesters)

## The Wastewater Treatment Environment: Chemical Challenges

Wastewater treatment facilities (ETARs — Estações de Tratamento de Águas Residuais in Portuguese)
present a combination of chemical aggressors that eliminate most conventional lining materials
within 5-15 years. The primary chemical threats are:

### Hydrogen Sulphide and Biogenic Sulphuric Acid

Hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) is generated by sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in anaerobic zones of
wastewater systems — primary clarifiers, sludge digesters, anaerobic lagoons, and covered sewer
networks. H₂S gas rises and oxidises at the concrete surface above the waterline, where aerobic
bacteria convert it to sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) via the biogenic acid corrosion (BAC) mechanism.
This biogenic sulphuric acid destroys Portland cement concrete by attacking the calcium silicate
hydrate (CSH) binder, producing gypsum and ettringite. Concrete loss rates of 5-10 mm per year
have been documented in anaerobic digesters and primary clarifiers in European municipal ETARs.

EPDM resistance to sulphuric acid is excellent across the full range of concentrations encountered
in wastewater treatment, from trace biogenic acid to concentrated acid cleaning solutions (10-40%
H₂SO₄ at temperatures up to 70°C). The saturated polymer backbone has no reactive sites for
acid to attack. Published ASTM D471 data on EPDM immersion in 40% H₂SO₄ at 70°C shows no
measurable change in hardness, elongation or tensile strength after 168 hours.

### Ammonia

Ammonia (NH₃ / NH₄⁺) is a major constituent of municipal and agricultural wastewater. In
anaerobic digesters treating sludge, ammonia concentrations can reach 2,000-5,000 mg/L.
EPDM is resistant to ammonia at all concentrations encountered in wastewater treatment — unlike
PVC (plasticiser degradation) or some epoxy systems (hydrolytic attack on the amine linkage).

### Chlorine (Tertiary Disinfection)

Many Portuguese ETARs use chlorination for tertiary disinfection before discharge to water
bodies. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) at dosing concentrations of 5-20 mg/L is applied to
treated effluent in contact tanks. EPDM is fully resistant to chlorine at all disinfection
concentrations, including hypochlorite concentrations encountered during equipment cleaning.

### UV Radiation

Open stabilisation lagoons and polishing ponds are fully exposed to outdoor UV radiation.
EPDM's UV resistance — conferred by the saturated polymer backbone and carbon black loading
— makes it the preferred geomembrane material for open-surface applications. In contrast,
HDPE geomembranes require UV stabiliser packages that can deplete over time; PVC geomembranes
are fundamentally UV-unstable without additive protection.

## Facility Types: Applications for EPDM in ETARs

### Stabilisation Lagoons (Lagoas de Estabilização)

Stabilisation lagoons are ponds in which raw or settled wastewater is treated by natural
biological processes — algae photosynthesis, UV disinfection, sedimentation, and aerobic/
anaerobic bacterial action. They are widely used in Portugal for small municipal ETARs and
for preliminary treatment in agricultural and agro-industrial settings.

EPDM is the preferred lining material for lagoons because:
- Large continuous sheets (up to 15.25 m wide) minimise seams in the most vulnerable position
  of any containment system
- UV stability in open, uncovered lagoons — decades of outdoor exposure without degradation
- Root resistance (EN 13948) — critical at lagoon edges where emergent plants may establish
- Flexibility accommodates subsoil settlement without membrane failure

### Anaerobic Digesters (Digestores Anaeróbios)

Anaerobic digesters treat sludge (lamas) and high-strength organic effluent by methanogenic
bacteria in sealed, oxygen-free conditions. The digester environment presents the most chemically
aggressive conditions in any ETAR:
- Biogas (60-70% methane, 30-40% CO₂, plus H₂S, NH₃, water vapour)
- Temperature: 35-55°C (mesophilic and thermophilic operation)
- Highly alkaline or acidic conditions depending on process phase (pH 6-8 typical; acidogenic
  phases may reach pH 4-5)

EPDM is used for digester covers (flexible floating covers and fixed domed covers), digester
wall linings, and biogas collection bladders. Its resistance to methane, CO₂, H₂S, and organic
acids at elevated temperatures is well-documented. EPDM geomembrane bladders are used as
floating gas holders on open digesters across Europe.

### Clarifiers and Sedimentation Tanks (Decantadores)

Primary and secondary clarifiers are circular or rectangular tanks in which suspended solids
settle by gravity. Clarifier walls and floors require lining protection against biogenic acid
and the mechanical erosion of sludge scrapers. EPDM lining systems are applied to new
clarifiers and used in the rehabilitation of concrete clarifiers that have lost structural
integrity due to BAC.

### Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR Tanks)

SBR tanks alternate between aeration phases (with dissolved oxygen 1-3 mg/L) and quiescent
settling phases. The periodic wetting and drying cycles, combined with aeration equipment
vibration, require a lining system with high flexibility and fatigue resistance. EPDM's
400%+ elongation and elastomeric recovery make it well-suited to cyclically loaded tanks.

### Aeration Lagoons and Facultative Ponds

Facultative ponds maintain aerobic conditions in upper layers and anaerobic conditions in
lower layers. EPDM liners prevent seepage loss that would otherwise undermine treatment
efficiency and risk groundwater contamination. The Decreto-Lei 152/97 (implementing the EU
Urban Wastewater Directive) requires discharge consent compliance; unlined lagoons may fail
regulatory requirements through seepage losses.

### Reed Bed Systems (Leitos de Juncos / Filtros de Macrófitas)

Constructed wetland systems (leitos de juncos, filtros de macrófitas) use subsurface or
surface-flow through a gravel bed planted with reeds (Phragmites australis) or other
wetland species to treat secondary or tertiary effluent. EPDM lining of the reed bed basin
is critical to prevent infiltration to groundwater and to maintain the hydraulic head that
distributes flow through the filter media.

EPDM root resistance (FLL and EN 13948) is directly relevant — the same root-resistance
standard applied to green roof EPDM applies to reed bed applications where Phragmites roots
penetrate aggressively into substrate.

## EPDM vs Competing Lining Systems for ETARs

### HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) Geomembrane

HDPE geomembranes are widely used in municipal waste containment but have specific limitations
in ETAR applications:
- Stress cracking: HDPE is prone to environmental stress cracking (ESC) at folds, sharp bends,
  and around penetrations. In ETAR applications with cyclic hydraulic loading, ESC is a common
  failure mode.
- Thermal expansion: HDPE has a coefficient of thermal expansion approximately 10x that of
  concrete. In outdoor lagoons, this causes wrinkling and buckling that complicates seaming and
  creates uplift risk.
- Seam quality: HDPE seams are formed by thermal fusion welding; weld quality is highly
  dependent on operator skill and ambient conditions (temperature, humidity, cleanliness).
  Failed HDPE welds are the primary failure mode in HDPE geomembrane installations.
- Stiffness: HDPE at low temperatures (below +5°C) becomes brittle and difficult to handle.
  Installation in winter in central and northern Portugal requires heated geomembrane rolls.

EPDM advantages over HDPE:
- Elongation at break 400%+ vs HDPE 12-18% (HDPE fails at very low strain)
- No stress cracking mechanism in EPDM
- Thermal coefficient 5x lower — less wrinkling in outdoor applications
- Cold temperature flexibility: EPDM remains fully flexible at -45°C

### PVC Geomembrane

PVC geomembranes are lower cost than EPDM but have fundamental chemistry limitations in
wastewater:
- Plasticiser migration into biologically active water — plasticisers accumulate in sludge
  and may interfere with biological treatment
- UV degradation without continuous stabiliser protection
- Resistance to H₂S and biogenic acid inferior to EPDM
- Service life in aggressive wastewater environments: 8-15 years vs 50+ years for EPDM

### Concrete Lining and Protective Coatings

Traditional concrete ETARs rely on structural concrete providing containment. In environments
with biogenic acid corrosion (virtually all anaerobic zones), unprotected concrete fails within
10-20 years. Protective coatings used include:
- Epoxy coatings (2-component): excellent acid resistance when intact; fails at cracks
  and discontinuities; recoating every 5-10 years required
- Polyurethane coatings: less acid-resistant than epoxy; UV degradation in open applications
- Cementitious crystalline systems (e.g. Xypex): waterproofing by crystal growth in cracks;
  no crack-bridging capability; does not protect against BAC

EPDM lining systems applied to concrete tanks combine the structural strength of concrete with
the chemical resistance of EPDM, bridging substrate cracks up to several millimetres with no
loss of watertightness.

## Portuguese ETAR Infrastructure Context

Portugal has approximately 3,800 ETARs operated by municipal water and sanitation utilities
(serviços municipalizados, empresas municipais, and AdP — Águas de Portugal group entities).
Urban wastewater collection rate in Portugal reached approximately 88% of the population by
2023, with ongoing investment in rural ETAR infrastructure driven by EU cohesion funding.

Key Portuguese utilities and regulatory bodies:
- **ERSAR (Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos):** the sector regulator for
  water supply and wastewater services; publishes annual quality of service indicators
- **APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente):** environmental permitting authority; issues discharge
  consents and monitors compliance with Decreto-Lei 152/97 (Urban Wastewater Directive) and
  Decreto-Lei 236/98 (water quality objectives)
- **AdP (Águas de Portugal):** state holding company managing approximately 70% of Portuguese
  ETAR infrastructure through subsidiaries (Águas do Vouga, Simarsul, Simdouro, etc.)
- **LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil):** provides technical guidance on ETAR
  design and materials specification

## EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD)

The original Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC), transposed into Portuguese law
as Decreto-Lei 152/97, set minimum treatment standards for urban wastewater before discharge.
The recast Directive (EU) 2022/1072, approved in June 2022 and entering force progressively to
2035-2045, significantly strengthens requirements:

- Energy neutrality for large ETARs (> 10,000 PE) by 2040
- Micro-pollutant (pharmaceutical, cosmetic) removal (quaternary treatment) for large discharges
- Extended producer responsibility for pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries
- Digital monitoring and transparency requirements

For ETAR infrastructure investment, the recast UWWTD means that Portuguese utilities will be
required to invest substantially in facility upgrades through 2030-2045. This creates a
significant market for membrane lining systems in new construction and rehabilitation projects.

## Key Performance Data: EPDM in Wastewater Applications

**Long-term field performance:**
EPDM geomembranes have been in continuous service in European wastewater lagoons since the
1970s. Field samples extracted from 30+ year-old EPDM lagoon liners in Germany and France
and tested against original specification show:
- Tensile strength retention: > 90% of original
- Elongation retention: > 85% of original
- No surface cracking, crazing or biological colonisation of the membrane surface

**Biogas resistance:**
EPDM biogas bladders and digester covers have been in service at European biogas plants for
20+ years. Methane and CO₂ permeability through EPDM is low but not zero — for floating cover
applications, this is acceptable; for pressurised gas storage, EPDM is lined with a gas-barrier
layer (typically HDPE or polyamide).

**Root resistance:**
EPDM's resistance to plant root penetration, certified per FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft
Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau) guidelines and EN 13948, is critical in lagoon and
reed bed applications. Field evidence from green roof applications (structurally identical
root-resistance conditions) confirms no root penetration through correctly specified EPDM
over 20+ years of service.

## Odour Containment: EPDM Covers for ETAR Facilities

Odour management is a critical regulatory and community relations challenge for ETARs located
near residential areas. Hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from
primary treatment and sludge handling generate complaints that can threaten ETAR operating
licences.

EPDM floating and fixed covers are used to contain odorous gases from:
- Primary clarifiers and primary treatment tanks
- Sludge thickeners and sludge storage lagoons
- Anaerobic digesters (combined gas containment and odour control)
- Inlet works and screening areas
- Sludge drying beds (partial cover for odour mitigation and weather protection)

Floating EPDM covers consist of a reinforced EPDM membrane panel laid on the liquid surface,
with edge seals to the tank walls and a perimeter drainage channel to collect precipitation.
The biogas or odorous gas collected under the cover is extracted by blower to a biofilter,
chemical scrubber or thermal oxidiser.

Advantages of EPDM for floating covers:
- Specific gravity approximately 1.0 — neutral buoyancy facilitates deployment and minimises
  structural loads on tank walls
- Chemical resistance to H₂S, NH₃, VOCs, and condensate acids
- UV resistance for uncovered external surfaces
- Flexibility accommodates tank liquid level variation (floating cover rises and falls with
  liquid surface) without membrane stress

## Environmental and Sustainability Considerations

EPDM geomembrane systems in wastewater treatment contribute to multiple sustainability metrics:

**Groundwater protection:** intact EPDM lining eliminates seepage from wastewater lagoons and
tanks, preventing contamination of shallow aquifers — critical in Portugal's drought-stressed
hydrological context.

**Carbon footprint:** the 50+ year service life of EPDM means that one installation replaces
3-5 cycles of shorter-lived alternatives (epoxy recoating every 7-10 years), substantially
reducing embodied carbon and installation activity.

**Biogas recovery:** EPDM digester covers enable biogas collection and utilisation for
electricity generation or heat recovery, contributing to ETAR energy neutrality targets under
the recast UWWTD.

**Recycled content:** EPDM membranes at end of service life can be recycled into granulated
rubber for use in sports surfaces, road asphalt modifiers, and civil engineering products.
Several EPDM manufacturers offer take-back programmes for end-of-life membranes.
