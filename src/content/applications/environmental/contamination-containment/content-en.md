# EPDM Geomembrane for Contamination Containment

## Section 1: Soil and Groundwater Contamination in Portugal

Portugal carries an industrial and mining legacy whose consequences are not always visible at the surface but are legally and financially consequential in ways that no environmental manager, plant operator, or site owner can afford to ignore. Across the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which cuts through the Alentejo from Aljustrel and Neves-Corvo to the abandoned workings of São Domingos and Lousal, decades of sulphide ore extraction have left a persistent legacy of acid mine drainage. Stream and aquifer pH values as low as 2–3, combined with iron, zinc, copper, cadmium, and arsenic concentrations many times above European limit values, define the hydrochemical reality of an entire region — one that continues to demand engineered containment solutions long after the mines themselves have closed.

In the industrial zones of Sines and Barreiro, the petrochemical and chemical manufacturing heritage has generated documented soil and groundwater contamination with chlorinated solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. The Estarreja chemical complex, one of the most extensively studied cases of industrial contamination in Portuguese environmental history, accumulated decades of chemical waste deposition whose remediation continues to demand specialist geomembrane containment capability. In urban centres — Lisbon, Porto, Setúbal — former gasworks sites undergoing regeneration expose pervasive PAH contamination that only becomes apparent when ground is broken for development. Across the country, active industrial sites in chemicals, ceramics, tanning, surface treatment, and agrifood processing generate process liquids and waste streams that require reliable secondary containment to prevent their reaching the soil and groundwater beneath them.

The legal consequence of contamination reaching the environment is defined by Decreto-Lei 147/2008, which transposed the EU Environmental Liability Directive (2004/35/EC) into Portuguese law. The principle is financially explicit: those who pollute pay for the environmental damage they cause. Operators of high-risk activities — waste management, chemical production, mining, intensive agriculture, and others listed in Annex III of the Directive — bear strict liability for damage to soil, groundwater, surface water, and protected habitats and species. The Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA) is the competent authority for enforcement, with powers to require preventive action, impose remediation obligations, and pursue cost recovery from liable operators. Financial guarantee requirements for the highest-risk operators mean that containment failure is no longer merely an operational problem — it is a direct liability that appears on balance sheets and insurance schedules.

Engineered containment systems — secondary containment bunds around tanks and chemical stores, liner systems beneath industrial lagoons and effluent ponds, low-permeability caps over contaminated land, spill containment berms at transfer and loading points — are the primary engineering controls that prevent contamination events from becoming regulatory liabilities. Membriko, based in Pombal, Leiria, provides EPDM geomembrane systems for the full spectrum of environmental and industrial containment applications across Portugal, designed, installed, and tested to the precision that these applications demand.

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Contamination Containment

The selection of a geomembrane material for environmental containment is a consequential engineering decision. It is not a procurement commodity comparison — it is a materials engineering question whose answer determines whether the containment system performs for fifty years or develops integrity problems within a decade. Membriko's position is that EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is the technically superior choice for the majority of industrial and environmental containment applications that do not involve sustained primary contact with concentrated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons.

### The Chemistry of EPDM Durability

EPDM's chemical durability is not achieved through sacrificial stabilisers or coatings — it is intrinsic to the molecular architecture of the polymer itself. The primary polymer backbone of EPDM is a saturated carbon-carbon chain with no reactive double bonds available for attack by the oxidising agents, acids, alkalis, and UV radiation that degrade less stable elastomers. This is in fundamental contrast to natural rubber and neoprene, which possess unsaturated backbone double bonds that are susceptible to ozonolysis, oxidative chain scission, and acid-catalysed degradation. EPDM does not undergo ozonolysis — a critical advantage in applications where ozone concentrations may be elevated, or where UV-generated ozone is a factor in exposed membrane service.

The cross-linked molecular network that forms during vulcanisation provides a further layer of durability. Unlike thermoplastic polymers, which can flow and creep under sustained stress at elevated temperatures, the cross-linked EPDM network has no capacity for irreversible deformation under the loads and temperatures encountered in containment service. There is no cold flow, no creep, no permanent set accumulation over time. The membrane installed today performs the same containment function fifty years from now as it does on day one.

### Flexibility — The Decisive Mechanical Advantage

The mechanical property that most differentiates EPDM from thermoplastic geomembranes in containment applications is elongation at break. EPDM geomembrane achieves 300–500% elongation at break — the membrane can stretch to four or five times its original length before failure. HDPE geomembrane, the most widely used alternative, achieves 12–30% elongation at break in the textured grades typically used for landfill and containment applications.

This difference is not merely numerical. It translates directly into field performance across the conditions that containment applications impose:

**Differential settlement:** Contaminated land, landfill bases, and earthen embankments settle unevenly over time. A liner with 12% elongation will experience tensile failure if differential settlement creates localised tension of more than a fraction of the panel's installed dimension. An EPDM liner with 300% elongation accommodates the same settlement without any risk of membrane failure — the elastic network stretches and returns without permanent damage.

**Irregular substrate geometry:** Secondary containment bunds, brownfield remediation caps, and spill containment berms are rarely perfectly regular in geometry. Pipe penetrations, sump bases, anchor trench corners, and transitions between floor and wall impose three-dimensional shape demands on the membrane. EPDM conforms elastically to these geometries; HDPE's relative rigidity requires careful panel layout and field welding to manage the same demands, with higher risk of stress concentration at geometric transitions.

**Thermal movement:** Like all geomembranes, EPDM expands and contracts with temperature change. Because EPDM is flexible, thermal movement is accommodated elastically — the membrane breathes with temperature without generating cumulative stress. HDPE's higher rigidity means that thermal movement generates cyclic stress, which accumulates at seams, anchor trenches, and geometric transitions over the membrane's service life.

**Low-temperature performance:** EPDM retains full flexibility down to -45°C. In the context of Portuguese climate, this is not a routine design consideration, but for cold storage facilities, refrigerated warehouses, and high-altitude sites in the Serra da Estrela region, it provides margin that HDPE cannot match below -10°C without progressive embrittlement.

### Environmental Stress Cracking — A Risk Unique to Thermoplastics

Environmental stress cracking (ESC) is a failure mode that affects semicrystalline thermoplastic polymers — including HDPE — but not cross-linked elastomers such as EPDM. ESC is a slow crack growth phenomenon that occurs at stress levels far below the material's measured short-term tensile strength, in the presence of specific chemical agents including surfactants, polar organic compounds, and certain detergents. The critical implication for containment is that HDPE may develop crack growth failures at concentrations of chemical agents that do not cause any measurable change in bulk chemical resistance testing — the material passes laboratory immersion tests but fails under combined stress and chemical exposure in service.

EPDM's cross-linked network structure has no capacity for ESC. The absence of a crystalline structure that can undergo slow crack propagation means that Membriko's EPDM containment systems are not vulnerable to this failure mode, regardless of the surfactant content or polar organic loading of the contained liquid.

### Standards and Certification

Membriko's EPDM geomembrane systems for environmental containment are produced and installed in accordance with:

- **EN 13956:** Flexible sheets for waterproofing — requirements for plastic and rubber sheets for roof waterproofing — the primary European standard for EPDM flexible sheets
- **EN 13491:** Geosynthetic barriers — characteristics required for use as a fluid barrier in the construction of tunnels and underground structures (chemical resistance testing methodology)
- **EN 13361:** Geomembranes for the construction of artificial water reservoirs and retention ponds
- **EN 14991:** Geomembranes for solid waste facilities
- **GRI-GM19:** Geosynthetic Research Institute specification for EPDM nonreinforced geomembrane

These certifications provide the documentary framework that APA and project permitting authorities require when reviewing containment system designs. Membriko provides full material certification and conformity documentation as a standard component of the project documentation package.

## Section 3: The Four Containment Application Types

Membriko's environmental containment capability spans four distinct application types, each with its own regulatory context, geometric challenge, and performance requirement. The same EPDM material platform and installation methodology underpin all four — but the engineering design and quality assurance protocols are calibrated to each application's specific demands.

### Secondary Containment Bunds

Secondary containment bunds are the most widely required environmental engineering control for industrial liquid storage. Under the requirements of DL 147/2008, the Industrial Emissions Directive (transposed by DL 127/2013), and sector-specific BREF documents, operators of facilities storing hazardous liquids — acids, alkalis, solvents, oils, fuel, process chemicals — are required to provide secondary containment capable of holding 110% of the volume of the largest tank in the bunded area, or 25% of the total volume of all tanks, whichever is greater.

Membriko EPDM secondary containment bund liners are installed as continuous, seamless membranes across the bund floor and up the interior faces of concrete or earthen bund walls, with the membrane carried into an anchor trench at the top of each wall face. The continuity of a single EPDM membrane from floor to wall eliminates the rigid-to-flexible transition joints that are inherent in alternative systems — transitions that represent stress concentration points and long-term integrity risks. Chemical resistance is confirmed against the specific stored products at each site; for mixed-chemistry bunds serving multiple tank types, Membriko's technical team evaluates the combined chemical exposure and specifies the appropriate EPDM grade and thickness.

Bund sizes for typical industrial secondary containment range from 50 m² for a single IBC store to 5,000 m² or more for large tank farm impoundments. Membriko has installed secondary containment systems at chemical plants, petroleum depots, pharmaceutical manufacturing sites, and agro-industrial facilities across Portugal, in all cases providing the complete documentation package — as-built drawings, material certification, seam records, leak detection test results, and installation warranty — that industrial operators require for regulatory compliance and insurance purposes.

### Lagoon and Effluent Pond Lining

Industrial effluent lagoons, process water ponds, leachate storage facilities, and biological treatment pond liner systems represent a technically demanding class of containment application. The contained liquids are typically complex mixtures — effluent from chemical manufacturing may contain heavy metal ions, organic solvents, surfactants, and varying pH; leachate from industrial waste lagoons may contain concentrated inorganic salts, oxidising agents, and ammonia; biological treatment ponds may cycle between aerobic and anaerobic chemistry.

EPDM's broad chemical resistance profile across inorganic acids, alkalis, oxidising agents, aqueous salt solutions, and complex organic mixtures makes it the appropriate liner material for the majority of these applications. Membriko supplies EPDM liner systems for lagoons and ponds in widths up to 15.25 metres, minimising the number of field seams on large-area installations and reducing the associated integrity risk. Where the geometry permits, factory-prefabricated panels are supplied with factory-made seams — quality-controlled under factory conditions and delivered to site ready for field connection — reducing the field seaming programme to the minimum necessary.

Earthen embankment slopes present a particular conformation challenge for rigid geomembrane materials. EPDM's flexibility allows the membrane to conform naturally to earthen slope contours without the temporary ballasting, panel pinning, and mechanical tensioning that HDPE installation on sloped surfaces requires. This reduces installation time, reduces the risk of membrane damage during handling, and produces a liner system that accommodates minor embankment surface irregularities without localised stress.

### Spill Containment Systems

Spill containment systems are required at liquid transfer points — loading bays, tanker loading/unloading terminals, drum-filling areas, pipe manifold stations, and vehicle fuelling points — where the risk of accidental release is highest. Unlike secondary containment bunds, which are permanent engineered structures, spill containment systems may be configured as permanent below-grade liners, as above-grade EPDM containment berms, or as rapidly deployable temporary containment systems for emergency response.

Membriko supplies and installs all three configurations. For permanent below-grade spill pits and drip trays at loading areas, Membriko installs EPDM liners with appropriate drain connections and oil-water separator outlets. For above-grade containment berms at outdoor transfer areas, prefabricated EPDM berm panels with internal corner formers are deployed and connected using Membriko's QuickSeam adhesive system — a field-applied self-adhesive seaming tape system that achieves full chemical resistance at the seam without hot works. For emergency response deployments, Membriko's rapid-mobilisation stock programme holds EPDM membrane and seaming materials at the Pombal facility for priority despatch within 24 hours of an emergency call.

The chemical aggressiveness of spill containment scenarios is by definition variable and unpredictable — a loading bay may handle multiple products on successive days, and an emergency spill may involve any substance on the site's storage manifest. EPDM's broad chemical resistance across the non-hydrocarbon chemistry range means that Membriko's spill containment systems provide effective containment across a wide range of realistic spill scenarios without requiring product-by-product membrane specification.

### Contaminated Land Remediation Caps

Containment caps over contaminated land represent one of the most technically demanding and growing applications of geomembrane technology in Portugal. Rather than removing contaminated soil — an approach that generates enormous volumes of waste requiring treatment and disposal, and that is technically or economically infeasible for large sites — capping installs a low-permeability barrier over the contaminated area to achieve three engineering objectives simultaneously:

**Infiltration prevention:** Preventing rainwater from percolating through the contaminated zone, generating leachate that carries contaminants to groundwater. This is typically the primary performance objective — eliminating the hydraulic driving force that moves contamination from the source zone to receptors.

**Vapour management:** For sites contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — chlorinated solvents such as PCE and TCE at Estarreja and other former chemical industry sites, or BTEX compounds at petroleum-contaminated sites — the cap membrane acts as a vapour retarder, limiting the upward migration of contaminated vapour. Gas venting layers beneath the cap collect and route vapour to controlled treatment or passive dispersion systems.

**Physical isolation:** The cap provides a physical barrier between contaminated soil and site users, construction workers, and ecological receptors above — a risk reduction measure that is essential where surface soil concentrations exceed health-based screening values.

Membriko's EPDM geomembrane systems are technically well matched to contaminated land cap applications. The high elongation of EPDM (300%+) accommodates the differential settlement that is characteristic of disturbed ground and mine waste deposits — particularly relevant at the Iberian Pyrite Belt mining sites in the Alentejo, where irregular topography and variable waste deposit depths create significant settlement differentials. EPDM's root resistance makes it compatible with revegetated cap designs, where herbaceous and shrub vegetation is established over the cap system to control erosion, manage evapotranspiration, and integrate the capped area into the surrounding landscape. UV stability allows extended temporary surface exposure during phased construction sequences at complex sites, without the UV-embrittlement risk that affects HDPE panels left uncovered during construction.

Membriko works as the specialist geomembrane contractor within project teams led by environmental consultants and geotechnical engineers. This collaborative working model means that Membriko's detailed membrane design is co-ordinated with the geotechnical designer's cap profile, the environmental consultant's remediation action plan objectives, and APA's regulatory requirements — delivering a cap system that satisfies all three simultaneously.

## Section 4: Chemical Resistance Spectrum

Chemical resistance is the defining performance parameter for any containment geomembrane. The contained liquid determines whether the membrane maintains its barrier function throughout its design life or whether degradation — swelling, softening, permeation increase, or loss of tensile properties — progressively compromises containment integrity. Membriko's technical assessment of each project's chemical exposure begins with a systematic review of the contained liquid chemistry and a confirmation of EPDM's resistance data for the specific chemical conditions involved.

### Where EPDM Performs Excellently

**Inorganic acids — dilute to concentrated:** EPDM is one of the strongest-performing elastomers in inorganic acid service. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) to 37%, sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) to 50%, phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) to 85%, and nitric acid (HNO₃) to 20% all produce no measurable change in tensile properties, hardness, or mass after prolonged immersion testing. This resistance profile is directly relevant to acid mine drainage containment in Portugal's Iberian Pyrite Belt mining region, where drainage pH values of 2–3 combined with high dissolved metal concentrations represent the most aggressive aqueous containment environment encountered in Portuguese environmental practice.

**Alkalis and caustic solutions:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) to 50%, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) at saturation, and ammonia solution to 30% all produce excellent resistance in EPDM. This covers the full range of alkaline liquids encountered in industrial secondary containment — from effluent neutralisation systems to caustic chemical storage.

**Oxidising agents:** EPDM's saturated backbone makes it intrinsically resistant to oxidising agents — a category where unsaturated elastomers and some thermoplastic geomembranes degrade rapidly. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) to 15%, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) to 30%, and atmospheric ozone to concentrations of 100 ppm produce no degradation in EPDM. This resistance is critical for containment applications at water treatment facilities, industrial bleaching operations, and any site where oxidising agents are present in the contained liquid or the service atmosphere.

**Aqueous salt solutions and heavy metal leachates:** Sodium chloride, calcium chloride, ferric chloride, zinc sulphate, and the complex heavy metal salt mixtures characteristic of industrial wastewater and contaminated groundwater all produce excellent resistance in EPDM. For sites dealing with chromium, lead, cadmium, arsenic, and copper in aqueous solution — the typical contaminant profile of Portuguese mining legacy sites and certain industrial effluents — EPDM provides reliable long-term containment performance.

**Municipal solid waste leachate:** MSW landfill leachate is one of the most chemically complex aqueous waste streams encountered in environmental practice — a mixture of organic acids, ammonia, inorganic salts, heavy metals, and variable organic compounds whose chemistry changes seasonally and over the lifetime of the landfill. EPDM is one of the preferred liner materials for MSW leachate containment across European practice, with documented performance in this service over more than three decades at operating landfills.

### Where Honest Assessment Recommends HDPE or LLDPE

Membriko's technical approach includes honest assessment of the chemistry cases where EPDM is not the optimal containment material — and where HDPE or LLDPE geomembranes are the appropriate specification. Directing a client towards the wrong material to win a project is not in Membriko's interest, nor the client's.

**Aliphatic hydrocarbons:** Pure aliphatic hydrocarbons — petrol, diesel, kerosene, heating oil — cause significant volume swelling in EPDM (up to 40–80% volume increase depending on concentration and temperature). The swelling is reversible on removal of the contaminant, but sustained immersion in concentrated hydrocarbon product compromises mechanical performance during the exposure period. For primary containment of pure aliphatic hydrocarbon streams, HDPE or LLDPE geomembranes are specified. For secondary containment bunds around petroleum storage — where the liner contacts product only in a spill scenario, not continuously — EPDM is used in practice with appropriate thickness selection and grade confirmation.

**Aromatic hydrocarbons:** Benzene, toluene, xylene (BTEX), and other aromatic compounds cause more aggressive swelling in EPDM than aliphatic hydrocarbons. For primary containment of aromatic streams, Membriko recommends HDPE. For secondary containment of aromatic-containing process streams, the design case is evaluated individually.

**Halogenated solvents:** Chlorinated solvents — tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), dichloromethane — are not compatible with EPDM in primary containment service. These are HDPE or LLDPE applications.

For projects where the contamination profile includes both the chemistry groups where EPDM excels and the chemistry groups where it does not — the mixed contamination scenarios common at complex industrial brownfield sites — Membriko's technical team provides material selection guidance that reflects the specific exposure conditions, contact duration, concentration levels, and regulatory requirements of the site. In some cases, composite liner systems combining EPDM with a chemical-specific barrier layer are the correct solution.

## Section 5: Installation Methodology — Eight Steps

Environmental containment installation demands a level of quality assurance that exceeds standard waterproofing practice. The consequence of a pinhole defect in a roof waterproofing membrane is a maintenance call. The consequence of an undetected defect in a secondary containment bund liner may be a regulatory enforcement action, a groundwater contamination incident, and a financial liability under DL 147/2008. Membriko's installation methodology for containment projects is calibrated to this reality.

### Step 1: Site Assessment and Contaminant Characterisation

The project begins with a systematic assessment of the containment site and the chemistry of the contained liquid. For secondary containment bunds, this involves reviewing the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all stored products, confirming the chemical resistance data for the EPDM grade and thickness being specified, and assessing the mechanical conditions — substrate type, anticipated settlement, vehicle loading, UV exposure — that will govern membrane performance in service.

For remediation cap projects, Membriko reviews the site investigation report and remediation action plan (RAP) to understand the contamination profile, the cap design objectives, and the performance criteria that APA has accepted as the basis for the remediation approach. The geomembrane specification is derived from this review — thickness, grade, drainage layer requirements, gas venting provisions, and protective cover specification are all determined by the site-specific conditions.

### Step 2: Containment Design and Material Specification

Membriko's technical team prepares the detailed membrane design, including the panel layout plan, seam locations, penetration details, anchor trench design, leachate collection provisions, and the specification of accessory materials — geotextile protection layers, drainage geocomposites, QuickSeam tapes, and hardware items. The design is co-ordinated with the civil designer's structural drawings to ensure geometric compatibility. For projects requiring APA review, Membriko provides the geomembrane technical data sheets, certification documents, and design drawings in the format required for regulatory submission.

### Step 3: Substrate Preparation

Substrate preparation is the foundation of membrane integrity. All sharp objects — stone protrusions, reinforcement bar ends, concrete blowouts, angular aggregate — are removed from the substrate surface. Where the substrate is coarse aggregate or compacted granular fill, a geotextile protection layer (minimum 300 g/m²) is installed before the membrane to prevent puncture under operational loads. For earthen substrates, the surface is proof-rolled to achieve the specified density, and any soft spots are stabilised or regraded. Drainage blanket layers are installed where the design specifies leachate collection beneath the membrane. Membriko's site supervisor signs off substrate condition before membrane deployment begins.

### Step 4: EPDM Geomembrane Deployment

EPDM panels are deployed from rolls, working from the high point of the installation downslope to allow gravity to assist natural panel conformation. Panel edges are aligned to the seam locations shown on the panel layout plan. On sloped surfaces, panels are mechanically anchored at the top of the slope using the anchor trench system before being unrolled down the slope face, preventing uncontrolled movement during deployment. In complex geometries — sump bases, corners, pipe penetrations — the membrane is cut and shaped in the field by Membriko's trained operatives, with any cut edge receiving primer treatment before seaming.

### Step 5: Field Seaming with QuickSeam

All field seams are formed using QuickSeam tape — Firestone's factory-applied self-adhesive butyl seaming tape system, applied over a QuickPrime Plus primer-treated EPDM surface. The QuickSeam system achieves a seam peel strength equivalent to the base membrane strength, with full chemical resistance at the seam interface. Seam formation follows a defined procedure: surface cleaning, primer application, primer dry time confirmation, tape placement, roller application, and peel test on a representative coupon sample. Membriko requires a minimum lap width of 150 mm at all field seams. Every seam is logged by location and operative, and a photographic record is maintained as part of the project quality file. No seam is covered with protective material until it has been inspected and recorded.

### Step 6: Penetration Details and Singular Points

Pipe penetrations, drain outlets, leachate collection sump connections, and access hatches are the highest-complexity elements of any containment installation. Membriko uses EPDM pipe boots — prefabricated flexible collars that are bonded to the membrane and secured around the penetrating element with stainless steel compression clamps. The boot-to-membrane bond is formed using the same QuickSeam primer and tape system used for field seams, ensuring chemical resistance continuity at the penetration. All penetration details are photographed and logged before being covered by protective layers. For critical applications, the penetration detail integrity is verified by the leak detection procedure in Step 7.

### Step 7: Leak Detection and Integrity Testing

Before any protective layer is placed over the completed membrane, Membriko carries out electrical leak location (ELL) testing on all containment projects above the defined risk threshold. The water-lance method is used for containment bunds and ponds: the upper surface of the membrane is wetted with a continuous water film from a controlled water source while electrodes on the underside detect current anomalies at any point where the membrane is breached. Defects as small as 0.5 mm diameter are reliably detected by this method. Any defect identified is marked, repaired, and retested before the test is concluded.

For secondary containment bunds, a water fill test may also be conducted — the completed bund is filled with clean water to 110% of the design containment volume and held for 24 hours, with water level monitored for any measurable loss. ELL test records, water test records (where conducted), and defect-and-repair logs are included in the project quality documentation package.

### Step 8: Protective Cover and Long-Term Monitoring Provision

The completed and tested membrane is protected from mechanical damage by a geotextile cushion layer (minimum 200 g/m², 300 g/m² where granular drainage layers are placed directly on the membrane). Drainage geocomposites or granular drainage blankets are installed over the protection layer where leachate collection is required. Cap soils, gravels, or engineered surface protection are placed as designed over the drainage system. Monitoring provisions — groundwater monitoring well installations, leachate collection sump instrumentation, or permanent electrode grid connections — are installed as part of the final stage. The Membriko 20-year installation warranty is issued upon completion of the project documentation package. For clients who wish to maintain active monitoring contact, Membriko offers an annual inspection visit programme as part of the warranty support service.

## Section 6: Leak Detection Systems for Containment

The role of leak detection in environmental containment is qualitatively different from leak detection in other waterproofing applications. In a roofing context, the consequence of an undetected defect is water ingress, damp, and building damage — serious but manageable. In a containment context, the consequence is contamination of soil and groundwater, which may trigger APA enforcement action, require costly remediation, create long-term third-party liability, and in serious cases result in criminal prosecution. Membriko's containment projects are delivered with a leak detection protocol that is proportionate to this consequence level.

### Electrical Leak Location During Installation

The water-lance ELL method is the standard Membriko containment integrity test, applied to the completed membrane before any protective layer is placed. A continuous water film is maintained on the upper membrane surface while electrodes scan the underside for current anomalies — an anomaly indicates a breach through which the water film and the electrically conductive electrode circuit are in contact. The method is sensitive to defects from 0.5 mm diameter upwards, covering the full range of mechanical damage that could occur during installation. Testing is carried out by trained Membriko operatives using calibrated ELL equipment, and all test results are recorded and reported in the project quality file.

### Dipole Method for Bare Liner Areas

Where the membrane is installed in an area that will remain exposed — a secondary containment bund floor prior to flooding, or a cap membrane before protective cover placement — the dipole ELL method can be applied. An electrical current is passed through the membrane; current concentration at membrane defects is detected by a scanning electrode array on the surface. This method does not require a water film and is effective on dry membrane surfaces in exposed areas.

### Permanent Electrode Grid Monitoring

For critical containment applications — hazardous waste lagoon liners, long-term remediation cap systems at high-consequence sites, or industrial containment bunds where a contamination incident would have severe regulatory consequences — a permanent electrode grid system is installed beneath the membrane during construction. The grid is connected to a permanent monitoring unit that logs electrical resistance continuously. Any breach of the membrane that allows conductive liquid contact with the grid generates a measurable anomaly that is recorded and triggers an alert. Membriko designs and installs permanent electrode systems as part of the containment system design for projects where real-time integrity assurance is required or specified by the regulatory authority.

### Conventional Monitoring

Leachate collection sumps with flow monitoring provide a conventional indicator of containment performance — a sustained increase in collected leachate volume may indicate increased percolation through the containment system. Downgradient groundwater monitoring wells, mandatory for hazardous waste sites under DL 183/2009, provide the ultimate verification of containment performance over time by detecting any contamination plume migration in the aquifer below and downgradient of the site. Membriko provides data from installation testing in formats compatible with the monitoring record systems that APA and environmental consultants use for ongoing regulatory reporting.

## Section 7: EPDM Compared to HDPE, PVC, and GCL Systems

Membriko's approach to material selection is honest. EPDM is not the correct solution for every containment requirement. The comparison below is designed to give specifiers the information they need to make the right choice for their specific application — including the cases where Membriko would recommend an alternative material rather than EPDM.

| Characteristic | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE | PVC Geomembrane | Geosynthetic Clay Liner (GCL) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | 300–500% | 12–30% | 150–250% | Not applicable |
| Environmental stress cracking | Not susceptible | Susceptible | Not susceptible | Not applicable |
| Cold temperature flexibility | Flexible to -45°C | Embrittles below -10°C | Stiffens below -20°C | Not applicable |
| Inorganic acid and alkali resistance | Excellent | Good | Moderate | Good |
| Oxidising agent resistance | Excellent | Good | Moderate | Good |
| Aliphatic hydrocarbon resistance | Moderate (swelling) | Excellent | Poor | Good |
| Aromatic hydrocarbon resistance | Limited | Excellent | Poor | Good |
| Complex geometry adaptability | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Moderate |
| Seaming method | QuickSeam adhesive (no hot works) | Hot wedge welding (requires specialist plant) | Hot air welding or solvent | Bentonite paste overlap |
| Plasticiser migration risk | None | None | Present (concern for ecological receptors) | None |
| UV resistance during construction | Excellent | Good (embrittles if left long-term) | Moderate | Not applicable |
| Relative cost per m² | Medium | Low–Medium | Low | Low |
| Projected service life | 50+ years | 50+ years | 20–30 years | 50+ years (as mineral component) |

**When HDPE is the better choice:** For large-scale landfill applications with regular geometry — flat base liners, uniform side slopes — HDPE offers a lower material cost and well-established regulatory acceptance within the landfill directive framework. For primary containment of pure aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon streams, HDPE's superior chemical resistance to these compound classes is the decisive factor. Membriko's technical team will recommend HDPE or LLDPE for these applications where they represent the optimal technical solution.

**When EPDM is the better choice:** For industrial secondary containment bunds, lagoon and effluent pond lining, brownfield remediation caps, and any application where irregular geometry, substrate settlement, complex chemistry (non-hydrocarbon), or cold-temperature performance is a design consideration — EPDM's combination of flexibility, chemical breadth, and installation adaptability is the decisive advantage. These are the applications where Membriko has developed its specialist capability, and where the performance difference between EPDM and thermoplastic alternatives has real long-term consequences.

**A note on PVC:** PVC geomembranes contain plasticisers that may migrate into contained liquids over time. For containment of liquids that may reach ecological receptors — which is the definition of environmental containment — plasticiser migration is a contamination concern in its own right. Membriko does not use PVC membranes for environmental containment applications.

**The role of GCLs:** Geosynthetic clay liners are mineral barrier components used in composite liner systems alongside a primary geomembrane. They are not alternatives to geomembranes — they are complementary components. In composite liner systems for hazardous waste or high-consequence containment, EPDM as the primary geomembrane combined with a GCL secondary barrier provides a two-component system where each component has different failure modes, and the two together provide a redundancy of performance that neither can achieve alone.

## Section 8: Portuguese Environmental Regulations

Understanding the regulatory framework that governs environmental containment in Portugal is not a theoretical exercise for Membriko's technical team — it is the context within which every containment project is designed, documented, and delivered. The key legislative instruments that drive environmental containment investment in Portugal, and that define the performance requirements that Membriko's systems must satisfy, are outlined below.

### Decreto-Lei 147/2008 — Environmental Liability

DL 147/2008 transposes Directive 2004/35/EC (the Environmental Liability Directive) into Portuguese law. Its core provision is strict liability — without the need to prove fault — for operators of activities listed in Annex III of the Directive. These activities include: waste management operations, discharge to inland surface waters and groundwater, production, use, storage, processing, and disposal of listed hazardous substances, mining under the Mining Code, intensive poultry and pig farming, and other activities subject to IPPC/IED permitting.

Strict liability means that if contamination from a listed activity reaches the environment and causes damage to protected species, natural habitats, surface water, groundwater, or soil, the operator bears the cost of remediation regardless of whether the contamination resulted from negligence or an unforeseeable event. The financial consequence is not hypothetical — APA has the authority to require preventive action, impose remediation plans, and recover the cost of any remediation it carries out directly from the liable operator.

For industrial operators, the practical response to DL 147/2008 is investment in the containment engineering controls that prevent contamination events from occurring in the first place. A correctly designed and installed Membriko EPDM secondary containment system is the engineering documentation that demonstrates due diligence — the evidence that the operator took appropriate preventive action to prevent contamination from their hazardous liquid storage from reaching the surrounding environment.

### Decreto-Lei 183/2009 — Landfill Technical Requirements

DL 183/2009 transposes the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC) into Portuguese law. It defines the technical requirements for the construction and operation of municipal, non-hazardous, and hazardous waste landfills, including the liner system specifications. For hazardous waste landfills, the Directive requires a composite bottom liner consisting of a geomembrane of minimum 2.0 mm thickness overlying a mineral layer of minimum 0.5 m thickness with a hydraulic conductivity not exceeding 10⁻⁹ m/s. For non-hazardous landfills, the liner requirements are determined by a site-specific risk assessment taking into account the geological and hydrogeological setting and the nature of the waste leachate.

DL 183/2009 also establishes requirements for industrial on-site waste lagoons — where industrial operators store liquid waste before treatment or offsite disposal. These lagoons require liner systems that meet the technical standards for non-hazardous or hazardous waste containment depending on the classification of the stored waste. Membriko designs and installs liner systems for industrial waste lagoons in compliance with DL 183/2009 requirements.

### Lei 58/2005 — Water Framework Directive Transposition

Lei 58/2005 (the Bases Act for Water) transposes the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) into Portuguese law. The WFD requires member states to achieve "good ecological status" for all surface water bodies and "good chemical and quantitative status" for groundwater bodies. In Portugal, APA administers the river basin management plans (Planos de Gestão de Região Hidrográfica — PGRH) that identify significant pressures on water bodies, including contamination from industrial sources.

Industrial operators whose activities are identified as significant pressures in the relevant PGRH may be required to demonstrate that their containment measures are adequate to prevent water body impacts. Membriko's containment documentation — particularly the as-built drawings, material certification, and leak detection test records — provides the evidential basis for this demonstration.

### DL 127/2013 — Industrial Emissions Directive Transposition

DL 127/2013 transposes the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) and establishes the integrated environmental permitting framework for large industrial installations (the PCIP permit system). Under IED/PCIP permitting, operators are required to apply Best Available Techniques (BAT) as defined in the relevant BREF documents. For installations in the chemicals, waste treatment, and surface treatment sectors, the applicable BREFs specify secondary containment with a minimum 110% capacity bund, lined to prevent soil and groundwater contamination, as a BAT requirement for liquid storage areas.

Membriko's secondary containment systems, designed to the 110% volume rule with EPDM liner and documented integrity testing, satisfy the BAT secondary containment requirements in the relevant BREFs. The project documentation package that Membriko provides supports the operator's PCIP permit application and renewal documentation.

### APA Technical Guidance on Contaminated Sites

APA publishes technical guidance on site investigation, risk assessment, and remediation of contaminated land, following the EU Soil Thematic Strategy and the Common Forum on Contaminated Land risk-based framework. For containment cap and barrier systems proposed as remediation measures, APA requires that the remediation action plan (RAP) demonstrates that the containment system meets the performance objectives of the remediation — typically expressed as permeability targets for the cap membrane system, supported by validated material data and installation quality assurance records.

Membriko's project documentation package for remediation cap projects is structured to support RAP submissions to APA. Material certification data, design drawings, installation quality records, and leak detection test reports are provided in the format that APA technical reviewers require.

## Section 10: Maintenance and Monitoring

One of the most practically significant advantages of EPDM in long-term containment service is its low maintenance requirement. An EPDM containment system installed by Membriko with the correct substrate preparation, quality-assured seaming, and leak detection verification at completion is designed for a 50-year service life with minimal intervention. The maintenance obligations that do exist are well defined and proportionate to the operational risk of the installation.

### Routine Inspection

Membriko recommends annual visual inspection of all exposed membrane areas — anchor trench terminations, bund wall tops, accessible sump connections, and any areas where the membrane is not covered by protective layers. Inspection targets are: condition of anchor trench backfill (any erosion or movement that could stress the membrane at the termination); condition of perimeter seals; evidence of mechanical damage from vehicle tyres, forklifts, or falling objects; integrity of pipe boot seals at penetrations; and flow records from leachate collection sumps where present.

For capped sites with vegetated surfaces, the annual inspection includes assessment of root growth at the cap perimeter — where vegetation extends into anchor trench areas — and any evidence of cap surface settlement or erosion that could affect the drainage layer function.

### Post-Event Inspection

Triggered inspections are carried out after events that may have affected membrane integrity: significant seismic activity or notable ground movement; major spill events within secondary containment areas; construction activities in the vicinity of the containment system; or extreme weather events that could have caused physical damage to accessible membrane areas.

### Repair Procedure

EPDM damage is repaired using the same material and seaming system used for original installation. The damaged area is cleaned with QuickPrime Plus primer, a patch of EPDM geomembrane cut to overlap the damage by a minimum of 100 mm in all directions is bonded using QuickSeam tape, and the patch is rolled with a silicone seaming roller to achieve full adhesion. The repaired area is then tested using the water-lance ELL method or a spark test before return to service. All repairs are logged in the warranty maintenance record, which Membriko provides as a continuing service to clients on the annual inspection programme.

### Monitoring Data Management

For regulated containment sites — landfill-compliant liner systems, hazardous waste lagoons, and remediation cap installations — monitoring data from leachate sump flow records, groundwater monitoring wells, and permanent electrode systems is required to be maintained and reported to APA at defined intervals. Membriko supports clients in establishing the monitoring record system at project completion and provides the installation data in the format required for ongoing regulatory reporting. The project quality file produced by Membriko at project completion — containing as-built drawings, seam location records, material certification, and leak detection test reports — forms the baseline documentary record against which all subsequent monitoring data is interpreted.

## Section 11: Brownfield and Contaminated Land Remediation

Portugal's industrial history has created a significant national inventory of brownfield land with confirmed contamination requiring active risk management. The scale of this challenge, and the growing regulatory, financial, and commercial pressure to address it, is driving sustained demand for specialist geomembrane containment capability in the Portuguese environmental market.

### The Portuguese Brownfield Context

**Iberian Pyrite Belt — Mining Legacy, Alentejo:** The Pyrite Belt stretching from Aljustrel through Neves-Corvo to the historical workings of São Domingos, Lousal, and Castro Verde represents one of the most geochemically challenging brownfield environments in Europe. Acid mine drainage from exposed sulphide waste dumps and flooded mine workings continues to generate pH 2–4 leachate enriched in iron, zinc, copper, cadmium, and arsenic. The remediation of these sites involves containment cap systems over waste rock dumps to eliminate the principal infiltration pathway that generates drainage, and barrier systems to prevent migration of contaminated groundwater to the downstream river systems.

EPDM is particularly well suited to mine waste cap applications at these sites. The irregular topography of mine waste dumps — variable surface gradients, rock outcrops, settlement-prone loose waste — demands a membrane with the elongation and conformability to adapt to the geometry without inducing tensile stress at the irregularities. EPDM's 300%+ elongation delivers this adaptability in a way that HDPE, with its 12–30% elongation and higher stiffness, cannot match on rough terrain.

**Estarreja Chemical Complex:** The Estarreja industrial zone, home to Portugal's largest concentration of heavy chemicals manufacturing, has accumulated decades of soil and groundwater contamination with chlorinated anilines, mercury compounds, and organochlorine by-products from historical chemical production. The site remediation programme, one of the most complex in Portuguese environmental history, has involved containment engineering as a component of risk management for areas where full excavation is not technically or economically feasible. Membriko's technical capability in designing containment cap systems for complex mixed-contaminant brownfield sites is directly relevant to projects of this type.

**Barreiro Industrial Zone:** The Barreiro peninsula, historically home to CUF (Companhia União Fabril) — one of Portugal's largest industrial conglomerates — retains legacy contamination from decades of petrochemical, fertiliser, and chemical manufacturing. Redevelopment of the peninsula for residential and commercial use has required systematic contamination risk management, including capping of areas where contaminant concentrations exceed residential soil screening values.

**Sines Petrochemical Complex:** The Sines industrial zone, incorporating Portugal's largest oil refinery and an associated petrochemical complex, presents both active secondary containment requirements for ongoing industrial operations and legacy brownfield areas requiring remediation. The presence of both hydrocarbon-contaminated soil (where HDPE is the appropriate cap membrane material) and areas with mixed inorganic and PAH contamination (where EPDM's broader chemical resistance profile is advantageous) requires case-by-case material selection — the kind of site-specific technical assessment that Membriko provides for complex multi-contaminant sites.

**Former Gasworks and Urban Brownfield Sites:** Former manufactured gas plant sites in Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, and other Portuguese cities carry pervasive PAH contamination from historical coal gas production. Urban regeneration projects encountering these sites typically adopt a risk management approach — capping and covering the contaminated footprint rather than excavating the full contamination mass — both for cost reasons and because excavation would disturb a contamination source that is otherwise stable in its current configuration.

**Former Military Facilities:** Defence establishment sites across Portugal — former artillery ranges, maintenance depots, and ammunition storage areas — accumulate contamination profiles including heavy metals from ordnance residues, chlorinated solvents from vehicle and equipment maintenance, and in some cases fuel hydrocarbons. Containment cap systems represent a practical risk management solution for these sites, where full remediation to residential land use standards would be prohibitively expensive.

### Cap System Design Principles

A correctly designed contaminated land cap system integrates multiple layers, each performing a specific function, into a system that achieves the performance objectives of the remediation action plan. Membriko's EPDM geomembrane is the primary barrier layer — the performance-critical component whose integrity determines whether the cap achieves its infiltration prevention objective.

A typical Membriko contaminated land cap system from base to surface includes: a gas venting layer where VOC contamination is present (granular or geocomposite drainage layer with vent collection manifolds); the primary EPDM geomembrane barrier (typically 2.0 mm for most contamination scenarios); a geotextile protection layer; a drainage geocomposite or granular drainage layer to manage percolating rainfall above the barrier; a growing medium layer where revegetation is specified; and surface vegetation (usually a site-specific native species mix designed to manage evapotranspiration and resist erosion). The design is verified by water balance modelling — demonstrating that the combination of barrier permeability, drainage capacity, and evapotranspiration achieves the target reduction in leachate generation that the remediation action plan requires.

### Working Within Multi-Disciplinary Project Teams

Brownfield remediation projects are multi-disciplinary — site owners, environmental consultants, geotechnical engineers, planning authorities, and APA are all involved in the design, permitting, and delivery of the remediation. Membriko's role in these projects is as specialist geomembrane contractor: bringing detailed EPDM design capability, material knowledge, and installation quality assurance to a project team led by the environmental consultant and site owner.

This collaborative working model means that Membriko does not need to be the lead consultant on a brownfield project to contribute specialist value. Environmental consultants across Portugal work with Membriko as a reliable specialist subcontractor whose documentation standards, material knowledge, and installation quality are compatible with the rigorous quality management requirements of regulated remediation projects.

## Section 12: Industrial Compliance — Secondary Containment as a Regulatory Obligation

For industrial operators in Portugal — chemical manufacturers, petroleum distributors, pharmaceutical companies, surface treatment operations, food and beverage processors with chemical stores, waste treatment facility operators — secondary containment is not a discretionary investment. It is a regulatory obligation whose consequences of non-compliance are defined in law and enforced by APA.

### The DL 147/2008 Framework in Practice

DL 147/2008 creates strict liability — automatic, without proof of fault — for operators of Annex III activities. The practical consequence for an industrial operator is that any contamination from their facility that reaches soil, groundwater, surface water, or a protected habitat creates a legal liability that attaches to the operator immediately. There is no defence of reasonable care taken, no argument that the contamination resulted from an unforeseeable event. The liability is the contamination, and the liability is the operator's.

The financial guarantee requirement under DL 147/2008 — applicable to operators of the highest-risk activities — means that environmental insurers and financial institutions assess the quality of an operator's containment engineering as part of their risk evaluation. Operators with documented, tested, and warranted containment systems pay lower environmental insurance premiums and satisfy financial guarantee requirements more easily than operators who cannot demonstrate equivalent engineering controls.

### The 110% Volume Rule and Bund Design

The 110% secondary containment volume rule — the minimum standard in IED BREFs and accepted Portuguese and European practice — requires that the bunded area can retain the volume of the largest tank in the bund plus 10% operational margin. Membriko's bund design calculations are provided as part of the project documentation, confirming that the installed containment volume meets or exceeds the regulatory minimum for the specific tank configuration.

Beyond volume, the bund liner must provide the chemical resistance appropriate to the stored products. This is where material selection matters — a standard bituminous or painted concrete bund provides inadequate chemical resistance to acid, alkali, or oxidising agent spills. Membriko's EPDM liner system provides confirmed chemical resistance to the contained products, documented by the material certification and chemical resistance data provided with each project.

### ISO 14001 and Environmental Management Systems

Operators holding ISO 14001 Environmental Management System certification are required to identify and control their significant environmental aspects — including the risk of liquid releases from storage and process areas. A documented, tested, and warranted secondary containment system is the most straightforward engineering evidence that the significant environmental aspect of storage area liquid release has been controlled. Membriko's project documentation package — as-built drawings, seam records, leak detection reports, material certification, and warranty — provides the documented evidence required for ISO 14001 certification audits.

### Insurance Due Diligence

Environmental liability insurance in Portugal increasingly requires the insured to demonstrate that their containment engineering meets a defined standard. The Membriko documentation package — material certification confirming compliance with EN 13956 and EN 13491, installation quality records, ELL test reports, and the 20-year warranty — satisfies the due diligence requirements of environmental insurers and provides ongoing evidence of containment system integrity through the annual inspection programme.

### The Complete Membriko Documentation Package

For each industrial containment project, Membriko provides:
- As-built drawings showing membrane panel layout and seam locations
- Material certification documentation: EN 13956, EN 13491, CE marking, batch test certificates
- Seam location log with operative records for all field seams
- Electrical leak location test report confirming membrane integrity at completion
- Penetration detail photographs and records
- 20-year Membriko installation warranty
- Annual inspection visit programme (on request)

This documentation set is designed to satisfy the requirements of APA regulatory reporting, PCIP/IED permit compliance, ISO 14001 audit evidence, and environmental insurance due diligence — providing the operator with a single coherent documentary record for all regulatory and commercial purposes.

## Section 13: Emergency Response Containment

The unpredictable nature of industrial contamination incidents — tank ruptures, pipeline failures, road tanker accidents, fire suppression runoff, and process upsets — creates a demand for containment capability that is not always met by permanent engineered systems. Membriko's emergency response containment capability addresses both the pre-planned and the genuinely emergency dimensions of this requirement.

### Industrial Emergency Planning Requirements

Portuguese industrial operators classified under the Seveso III Directive (transposed by DL 150/2015) are required to maintain internal emergency plans (Planos de Emergência Interno — PEI) covering significant accident scenarios involving hazardous substances. For facilities storing flammable, toxic, or environmentally hazardous liquids above threshold quantities, the PEI must specify the containment measures that will be activated in the event of a major spill, tank rupture, or fire involving stored liquids. Membriko works with industrial operators to specify and supply the EPDM emergency containment systems that are identified in their PEI as deployed emergency resources.

### Pre-Fabricated EPDM Containment Berms

For planned emergency containment capacity — materials held in readiness for rapid deployment in a defined emergency scenario — Membriko supplies pre-fabricated EPDM containment berm systems. These systems consist of EPDM panel sections with pre-formed corner pieces and factory-applied QuickSeam tape edges ready for field connection. Deployment requires no hot works, no specialist equipment beyond rollers and hand tools, and no adhesive mixing. A trained response team can deploy a pre-fabricated Membriko containment berm covering 50–500 m² within 2–4 hours of receiving the mobilisation instruction.

### Rapid On-Site Fabrication

For emergency scenarios that require containment configurations that cannot be pre-planned — irregular spill areas, complex site geometry, large-scale events — Membriko's field teams can fabricate and deploy EPDM containment systems on-site within 24–48 hours. EPDM membrane and QuickSeam consumables are held at the Pombal facility in stock quantities sufficient for rapid mobilisation. Membriko's site operatives are experienced in working in demanding conditions — contamination events impose time pressure, access constraints, and chemical hazards that require both technical skill and operational composure.

### Fire Suppression Runoff Containment

A containment scenario that is sometimes overlooked in secondary bund design is fire suppression water. A major fire at a chemical storage or process facility generates large volumes of contaminated runoff — water, firefighting foam, dissolved chemicals, and combustion products — that must be contained to prevent environmental damage and public health impact. For Seveso-classified facilities, the Portuguese civil protection authority (ANEPC) expects operators to demonstrate credible runoff containment capacity. Membriko has supplied and installed EPDM runoff containment systems at industrial facilities — typically in the form of large-capacity earth berm impoundments or modified secondary containment areas — specifically to address the fire suppression runoff scenario.

### Membriko's Emergency Response Protocol

For clients who have established an emergency response relationship with Membriko, a 24-hour emergency contact line connects to Membriko's technical and operational team. Stock EPDM membrane and QuickSeam materials can be despatched from Pombal within 12 hours for critical priority emergencies. For Seveso-classified operators and others requiring documented emergency response capability, Membriko can formalise the emergency response arrangements as part of the client's Plano de Emergência Interno documentation.

## Section 14: Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Is EPDM approved for hazardous waste containment in Portugal?

EPDM geomembranes that meet the technical requirements of EN 13956 and EN 13491 — the standards to which Membriko's materials are certified — are technically compatible with the requirements of DL 183/2009 for hazardous waste containment when installed at the specified minimum thickness of 2.0 mm with quality-assured field seaming and electrical leak location testing. Regulatory acceptance of a specific containment system design is confirmed during the project permitting process with APA and the relevant licensing authority. Membriko provides the technical documentation — material certification, design drawings, chemical resistance data, and installation quality records — required to support the regulatory submission. Project-specific regulatory acceptance is confirmed during design rather than assumed.

### 2. What is the difference between EPDM and HDPE for environmental containment?

The most significant practical differences are elongation, environmental stress cracking resistance, and application suitability. EPDM achieves 300–500% elongation at break compared to 12–30% for HDPE — this means EPDM accommodates substrate settlement, irregular geometry, and thermal movement without tensile failure risk. HDPE is susceptible to environmental stress cracking in the presence of certain polar organic compounds and surfactants at concentrations that do not affect bulk chemical resistance; EPDM is not susceptible to ESC. For inorganic chemistry — acids, alkalis, oxidising agents, heavy metal solutions, and leachate — both materials perform well; EPDM's advantage is flexibility and ESC resistance. For aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon primary containment, HDPE is preferred. Membriko provides material selection guidance for each project's specific chemical and geometric conditions and does not recommend EPDM where HDPE is the more appropriate solution.

### 3. Can EPDM be used for fuel and petroleum storage secondary containment?

For primary containment of pure aliphatic hydrocarbon streams — petrol, diesel, kerosene, heating oil held continuously in contact with the liner — EPDM is not the optimal specification. Aliphatic hydrocarbons cause significant, though reversible, volume swelling in EPDM, and HDPE or LLDPE is the appropriate liner material for these applications. For secondary containment bunds around petroleum storage tanks — where the liner would only contact the product in a spill scenario rather than continuously — EPDM is used in practice, with the specific grade and thickness confirmed against the chemical resistance data for the product stored and the spill contact duration assumed in the design. Membriko provides a case-by-case assessment for petroleum secondary containment applications rather than a blanket recommendation.

### 4. How is leak detection carried out on an EPDM containment membrane?

Membriko uses electrical leak location (ELL) testing as the standard integrity verification method for containment projects above the defined risk threshold. The water-lance method is applied after membrane installation and before any protective layer is placed: a continuous water film is maintained on the upper membrane surface while calibrated electrodes on the underside detect current anomalies at any breach in the membrane. Defects from 0.5 mm diameter upward are detectable by this method. For secondary containment bunds, a water fill test to 110% of design volume may also be conducted. For critical long-term containment applications, permanent electrode grid systems provide continuous real-time monitoring of membrane integrity. All ELL test results are documented and included in the project quality file that Membriko provides with the installation warranty.

### 5. Does EPDM resist acid mine drainage conditions?

Yes. Acid mine drainage (AMD) from sulphide ore deposits — characterised by pH values as low as 2–3 and high concentrations of dissolved iron, zinc, copper, cadmium, and arsenic — represents one of the most chemically aggressive aqueous containment environments encountered in environmental practice. EPDM performs excellently across this chemical profile: the membrane is resistant to inorganic acids to pH 2 and below, and to concentrated inorganic salt solutions including the heavy metal sulphate complexes that dominate AMD chemistry. This resistance is documented in both laboratory immersion data and operational performance at mine waste management facilities across Europe. EPDM is the preferred geomembrane material for AMD containment caps and barrier systems in European practice, and Membriko's technical team has direct experience with AMD containment specification in the Iberian Pyrite Belt context.

### 6. What is the minimum recommended thickness for environmental containment?

The appropriate thickness for environmental containment depends on the chemical aggressiveness of the contained liquid, the mechanical conditions (substrate roughness, overburden loads, traffic), the regulatory classification of the waste or contained liquid, and the design service life. As a general guide: 1.5 mm is the minimum for primary containment of aqueous waste streams with moderate chemical aggressiveness; 2.0 mm is the standard specification for most industrial secondary containment and lagoon lining applications; 2.5 mm is specified for hazardous waste containment, highly aggressive chemistry, elevated mechanical damage risk, or applications where inspection intervals are long. Membriko confirms the appropriate thickness for each project based on the site-specific conditions and regulatory requirements — there is no single correct answer that applies to all containment situations.

### 7. Does Membriko have experience in contaminated land remediation projects?

Yes. Membriko, operating from its base in Pombal, Leiria, has installed EPDM geomembrane cap and barrier systems in contaminated land remediation projects across Portugal, working as specialist geomembrane contractor within project teams led by environmental consultants and geotechnical engineers. Experience covers acid mine drainage cap systems at former mining sites, industrial brownfield containment caps in the Sines and Estarreja industrial zones, and urban brownfield capping projects at former industrial and gasworks sites. In each case, Membriko provides the geomembrane design, material procurement, quality-assured installation, and full project documentation consistent with APA remediation action plan requirements and the quality management standards that regulated remediation projects demand.

### 8. How long does EPDM containment system installation take?

Installation duration depends on project scale, substrate condition, geometry complexity, and the extent of the leak detection testing and protective cover programme. A single secondary containment bund for an industrial storage tank area — typically 100–500 m² of membrane — takes 2–5 working days from substrate preparation through membrane installation, seaming, leak detection testing, and initial protective cover placement. Lagoon and effluent pond liner systems of 1,000–5,000 m² require 2–4 weeks typically. Contaminated land remediation cap systems are programmed on a project-by-project basis depending on site access, phasing requirements agreed with the environmental consultant and APA, and the extent of associated earthworks. Membriko provides a detailed installation programme with the project proposal, identifying the critical path activities and any programme constraints or dependencies specific to the site.
