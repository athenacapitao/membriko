# Contamination Containment — EPDM Research Summary

## EPDM for Environmental Containment: Core Chemistry and Relevance

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is one of the most chemically versatile elastomers in
existence, and its application to environmental containment is rooted in the same molecular
architecture that makes it exceptional for roofing, pool lining, and civil waterproofing. The
defining characteristic of EPDM in containment service is the saturated carbon-carbon backbone
of its primary polymer chain — a chain with no reactive double bonds available for attack by the
oxidising agents, acids, alkalis, and polar solvents that characterise industrial and environmental
contamination scenarios.

Unlike thermoplastic geomembranes such as HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) and LLDPE (Linear
Low-Density Polyethylene), which are crystalline polymers subject to environmental stress cracking
(ESC) under sustained mechanical loading in the presence of certain chemicals, EPDM is an
amorphous cross-linked elastomer. Its cross-linked network structure provides:

- Resistance to environmental stress cracking under chemical exposure
- Elongation at break of 300-500% (field-installed geomembrane grade)
- Flexibility retained at temperatures as low as -45°C
- No cold-flow or creep under sustained hydrostatic or overburden loading at ambient temperatures
- Elastic recovery after puncture-inducing deformation (important for containment over irregular
  substrates)

EPDM geomembranes for environmental containment are typically supplied at thicknesses of 1.0 mm,
1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 2.5 mm. The 1.5 mm grade is the minimum specified for primary containment
of aqueous waste streams in European practice; 2.0 mm is standard for most environmental
containment applications where chemical aggressiveness is moderate to high; 2.5 mm is specified
for highly aggressive leachates, petrochemical secondary containment, and applications where
mechanical damage risk during construction or operation is elevated.

## Chemical Resistance of EPDM to Contamination Scenarios

The chemical resistance of EPDM is not uniform across all chemical classes. The following is an
evidence-based summary of EPDM's performance across the principal contamination types encountered
in Portuguese environmental and industrial contexts.

### Strong Performance (EPDM Recommended or Preferred)

**Inorganic acids (dilute to moderate concentration):**
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl) up to 37%: excellent resistance; no measurable change in tensile
  properties or hardness after prolonged immersion
- Sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) up to 50%: excellent resistance; EPDM is the preferred liner material
  for acid neutralisation sumps and sulphuric acid secondary containment
- Nitric acid (HNO₃) up to 20%: good to excellent resistance; concentrated HNO₃ (above 50%)
  causes swelling and should be confirmed with specific grade testing
- Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) up to 85%: excellent resistance

**Alkalis and caustic solutions:**
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) up to 50%: excellent resistance
- Potassium hydroxide (KOH) up to 50%: excellent resistance
- Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) — saturated: excellent resistance
- Ammonia solution up to 30%: good resistance

**Oxidising agents (inorganic):**
- Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) up to 15%: excellent resistance
- Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) up to 30%: good to excellent resistance
- Ozone (O₃) at atmospheric and elevated concentrations: excellent resistance (intrinsic to
  EPDM's saturated backbone; unlike unsaturated rubbers, EPDM does not undergo ozonolysis)

**Alcohols:**
- Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol: good resistance at ambient temperature; swelling may occur at
  elevated temperature, which returns to baseline on cooling

**Aqueous salt solutions:**
- Sodium chloride, calcium chloride, ferric chloride, zinc sulphate: excellent resistance
- Heavy metal salt solutions (lead, cadmium, chromium): excellent resistance — relevant to
  industrial wastewater and contaminated groundwater containment

**Leachate from municipal solid waste (MSW):**
- EPDM is one of the preferred liner materials for MSW landfill leachate containment in European
  practice. Leachate is a complex mixture of organic acids, inorganic salts, ammonia, heavy metals
  and variable organic compounds. EPDM's broad chemical resistance profile covers the full
  spectrum of leachate chemistry encountered in Portuguese municipal waste facilities.

### Moderate Performance (Confirm Grade-Specific Data)

**Aliphatic hydrocarbons (petrol, diesel, kerosene):**
- EPDM is not recommended as a primary containment liner for pure hydrocarbon products. Aliphatic
  hydrocarbons cause significant swelling of EPDM (up to 40-80% volume increase depending on
  concentration and temperature). The swelling is reversible — on removal of the contaminant,
  EPDM recovers its dimensions substantially — but sustained immersion in concentrated
  hydrocarbons compromises mechanical performance during exposure.
- Exception: for secondary containment bunds around petroleum storage tanks where the liner is
  not in continuous contact with the contained product (intermittent contact only in spill
  scenarios), EPDM is used in practice, with confirmation of the grade-specific resistance data
  and appropriate thickness selection.

**Aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene):**
- Not recommended for primary containment. Aromatic compounds are absorbed more aggressively
  than aliphatic hydrocarbons and cause more severe swelling.
- For secondary containment of aromatic-containing streams, HDPE or LLDPE geomembranes are
  typically specified. Membriko's technical team assesses site-specific conditions.

**Ketones and esters:**
- Acetone, MEK (methyl ethyl ketone): moderate resistance — swelling occurs; not recommended
  for continuous immersion service
- Ethyl acetate, butyl acetate: moderate resistance

### Where HDPE or LLDPE is Preferred

For primary containment of pure petrochemical products, aromatic solvents, halogenated solvents
(chlorinated hydrocarbons), and concentrated ketones, HDPE and LLDPE geomembranes offer better
chemical resistance than EPDM. The Membriko technical team provides material selection guidance
for mixed contamination scenarios and cases where the chemical composition is uncertain.

## European and Portuguese Regulatory Context for Containment

### European Framework Directives

**Directive 2004/35/EC (Environmental Liability Directive — ELD):**
The ELD establishes the "polluter pays" principle for environmental damage to protected species,
natural habitats, surface water, and groundwater. Operators of activities listed in Annex III
(including waste management, mining, chemical production, and intensive agricultural operations)
bear strict liability for environmental damage. Secondary containment systems that prevent
contamination spreading to soil and groundwater are the primary engineering control that
demonstrates due diligence under the ELD.

**Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive — WFD):**
The WFD requires EU member states to achieve "good status" for all surface water and groundwater
bodies. National river basin management plans in Portugal (administered by APA — Agência Portuguesa
do Ambiente) identify contamination risk from industrial sources as a significant pressure.
Geomembrane containment systems are recognised engineering controls for preventing industrial
contamination of water bodies.

**Directive 2010/75/EU (Industrial Emissions Directive — IED):**
The IED requires operators of large industrial installations to apply Best Available Techniques
(BAT) for pollution prevention. BAT Reference Documents (BREFs) for relevant sectors (waste
treatment, chemicals, surface treatment of metals) specify secondary containment as a BAT for
liquid pollutant storage and handling.

### Portuguese National Legislation

**Decreto-Lei 147/2008 (Transposition of Environmental Liability Directive):**
DL 147/2008 transposes the ELD into Portuguese law. It establishes the liability of operators
for environmental damage and introduces mandatory environmental liability insurance or equivalent
financial guarantee for Annex III activities. The Portuguese Environment Agency (APA — Agência
Portuguesa do Ambiente) is the competent authority for enforcement.

**Decreto-Lei 183/2009 (Waste Management at Landfills):**
Transposing Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC, DL 183/2009 specifies technical requirements for
landfill sites including bottom liner systems. For hazardous waste landfills, a composite liner
system is required consisting of a geomembrane of minimum 2.0 mm thickness overlying a mineral
layer. For non-hazardous waste landfills, the liner requirements depend on the geological setting
and leachate risk characterisation.

**Decreto-Lei 276/2009 (Soil Protection and Use of Sewage Sludge):**
Establishes limit values for contaminants in soils and regulates the application of sewage sludge
to agricultural land. Relevant to the design of leachate collection and containment systems at
sewage sludge management facilities.

**Lei 82-D/2014 (Environmental Tax Reform and Liability):**
Introduced additional financial incentives for environmentally responsible management and penalties
for contamination incidents. Reinforces the financial case for preventive containment engineering.

### APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) Guidance

APA publishes technical guidance on site investigation, contaminated site remediation, and
environmental liability assessment. Portuguese guidance follows EU Soil Thematic Strategy
principles and the Common Forum on Contaminated Land methodology for risk-based assessment.
For containment cap and barrier systems in remediation projects, APA requires demonstration that
the containment system meets the performance objectives of the remediation action plan (RAP) and
that monitoring is specified to verify containment integrity over time.

## EPDM vs HDPE and Other Geomembrane Systems

### EPDM vs HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)

HDPE is the most widely used geomembrane material globally for landfill and containment
applications. Its dominance is principally driven by lower raw material cost and a well-established
regulatory acceptance in US EPA guidance (GRI, EPA guidance documents). In European practice,
the comparison is more nuanced:

**HDPE advantages over EPDM:**
- Lower cost per m² for large-scale applications
- Superior resistance to aromatic solvents and pure hydrocarbon products
- Established regulatory track record in landfill applications
- Wider availability in very large panel widths (7.5-10 m typical)
- Compatible with fusion welding (hot wedge / extrusion welding) — reliable seaming methodology

**EPDM advantages over HDPE:**
- Flexibility: EPDM elongation 300-500% vs HDPE 12-30% (typical textured HDPE for landfill)
  — EPDM accommodates substrate settlement and deformation without fracture; HDPE is prone
  to brittle fracture under tensile strain in the direction perpendicular to the slope
- Environmental stress cracking (ESC) resistance: HDPE is susceptible to ESC in the presence
  of surfactants, polar organics, and certain chemicals at concentrations below those that
  cause bulk degradation; EPDM is not susceptible to ESC
- Thermal performance: EPDM retains flexibility to -45°C; HDPE embrittles progressively below
  -10°C and is subject to significant thermal expansion (coefficient 1.5-2.0 × 10⁻⁴ /°C vs
  EPDM 2.0-2.5 × 10⁻⁴ /°C — similar coefficient but HDPE's rigidity means thermal movement
  generates stress while EPDM's flexibility absorbs it elastically)
- UV and weathering: HDPE surfaces exposed during construction can UV-embrittle if left
  uncovered; EPDM's intrinsic UV resistance allows longer exposure periods during construction
- Irregular geometry: EPDM in single large sheets with field seaming adapts to any geometry;
  HDPE's stiffness limits field conformation to regular slopes and floors

**Selection guidance:**
For aqueous waste streams, leachate, inorganic acids and alkalis, heavy metal solutions, and
landfill gas containment — EPDM and HDPE are both technically appropriate; selection is based
on cost, contractor expertise, and site geometry. For pure hydrocarbon products and aromatic
solvents — HDPE or LLDPE are preferred. For irregular geometry, cold climates, and applications
where substrate movement is anticipated — EPDM is preferred.

### EPDM vs PVC Geomembrane

PVC geomembranes are used in irrigation reservoirs, some waste containment and smaller
environmental applications. Their primary limitation for contamination containment:
- Plasticiser migration into contained liquid — unacceptable for drinking water catchment and
  for ecological receptors downstream of the containment
- Inferior chemical resistance to oxidising agents, ozone, and acid media
- Service life significantly shorter than EPDM under UV and thermal exposure

### EPDM vs Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCLs)

GCLs (sodium bentonite clay sandwiched between geotextiles) are used as mineral liner components
in composite liner systems. They function as low-permeability barriers (hydraulic conductivity
< 5 × 10⁻¹¹ m/s) and are not a direct alternative to geomembranes — they are complementary.
In European landfill practice, composite liner systems (geomembrane + GCL) are preferred over
single-component liners because the two components have different failure modes:

- If the geomembrane develops a pinhole, the GCL limits leachate migration to a very small area
  around the defect
- If the GCL develops hydraulic short-circuits (shrinkage in dry conditions, or chemical
  interaction with certain leachates that cause bentonite swelling inhibition), the geomembrane
  maintains primary containment

EPDM as the geomembrane component of a composite liner system is technically compatible with GCL
underlayers. The elastic nature of EPDM accommodates minor GCL consolidation settlement without
membrane stretching that could concentrate stress.

## Leak Detection Systems for Containment Applications

### Electrical Leak Location (ELL) Methods

**Dipole method (or Wenner array):** Applicable to bare geomembrane liners not in contact with
water. An electrical current is passed through the geomembrane; current concentrations at
damaged zones (which provide conductive paths through the membrane) are detected with
electrodes scanning the surface. Sensitivity: detects pinholes > 0.5 mm diameter.

**Water-lance method:** Applicable during membrane testing prior to covering. The upper surface
of the membrane is wetted with a continuous water film; electrodes on the dry underside detect
current flow through wet zones at membrane defects. Effective for confirming membrane integrity
before protective cover layers are placed.

**Geoelectric monitoring (permanent):** Electrode grids installed beneath the geomembrane
connected to a permanent monitoring system. Any breach of the geomembrane creates a current
anomaly that is logged continuously. Used in critical containment applications (hazardous waste,
chlorinated solvent groundwater barriers) where real-time integrity monitoring is required.

### Conventional Monitoring

**Leachate collection sumps:** Containment systems for landfill and industrial ponds include
leachate collection layers (drainage geocomposites or granular drainage blankets) with collection
sumps. Leachate quantity and quality are monitored to detect increases that indicate increased
percolation through the containment barrier.

**Groundwater monitoring wells:** Downgradient monitoring wells detect contamination plume
migration if containment is compromised. Mandatory for hazardous waste sites under DL 147/2008
and DL 183/2009.

**Tracer testing:** Fluorescent dye or chemical tracers can be introduced to the contained
liquid to confirm absence of migration through the liner system.

## Brownfield and Contaminated Land Remediation

Portugal has significant brownfield legacy contamination from historical industrial activity in
the following sectors:

**Mining (primarily Alentejo and Norte):**
- Pyrite and sulphide ore mining in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (Aljustrel, Neves-Corvo, São
  Domingos, Lousal) has left legacy acid mine drainage (AMD) with pH as low as 2-3 and high
  concentrations of iron, zinc, copper, arsenic, and other heavy metals
- EPDM is preferred over HDPE for AMD containment caps and barrier systems due to its flexibility
  on irregular terrain and its excellent resistance to low pH, high metal loading leachates

**Chemical manufacturing (Setúbal Peninsula, Sines, Estarreja):**
- Petrochemical and chemical complexes at Sines, Barreiro and Estarreja have generated soil and
  groundwater contamination with chlorinated solvents (PCE, TCE), heavy metals, and PAHs
- Containment cap systems over contaminated soil are a recognised remediation approach for these
  sites; EPDM serves as the primary barrier in low-permeability cap systems

**Military sites:**
- Former military installations and firing ranges have legacy contamination with heavy metals
  (lead, copper, antimony from projectile fragments) and occasionally chlorinated solvents from
  maintenance activities. Site remediation programmes managed by IASFA (Institute of Social
  Action of Armed Forces) include containment as a cost-effective risk management approach where
  full excavation is not feasible.

**Urban brownfields:**
- Former gas works (Gasómetros) in Portuguese cities (Lisboa, Porto, Setúbal) have pervasive
  PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) contamination from historical coal gas production. Urban
  brownfield redevelopment typically involves risk management through capping and containment
  rather than full remediation.

EPDM caps for contaminated soil function as:
1. Infiltration barriers: preventing rainwater from infiltrating through contaminated soil and
   generating leachate that reaches groundwater
2. Vapour barriers: limiting vapour-phase contaminant migration from soil to the atmosphere
   (relevant for volatile organic compound contamination)
3. Physical barriers: preventing direct contact with contaminated soil during site redevelopment

## Portuguese Environmental Market Context

The Portuguese environmental geomembrane market has grown consistently since the transposition
of EU environmental directives in the 2000s and 2010s. Key drivers include:

- EU-mandated landfill upgrades: DL 183/2009 required the closure or upgrade of non-compliant
  landfill sites; the majority of Portuguese landfills were upgraded with liner systems between
  2000 and 2015; some are now approaching the need for cap liner replacement
- Industrial liability pressure: DL 147/2008 (ELD transposition) created financial incentives
  for preventive containment investment by industrial operators to limit liability exposure
- Water Framework Directive implementation: APA's river basin management plans include
  requirements for contamination source controls that drive demand for industrial containment
- Brownfield redevelopment: urban regeneration projects increasingly encounter historical
  contamination requiring risk management through capping and containment systems

The environmental geomembrane installation market in Portugal is estimated to involve
approximately 500,000-800,000 m² of new geomembrane installation per year across all material
types and applications. EPDM holds a growing share of the non-landfill containment market
(industrial secondary containment, remediation caps, bund lining) due to its superior flexibility
and chemical resistance profile relative to thermoplastic alternatives for these applications.

Membriko, based in Pombal in central Portugal, brings specialist EPDM expertise to this
market segment. The Pombal location provides access to the principal industrial and environmental
containment markets of central Portugal, while Membriko's project capability extends to all
regions of the country.
