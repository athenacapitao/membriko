# Contamination Containment — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Contamination containment is one of the highest-stakes applications of geomembrane technology.
The audiences for this page are fundamentally different from the residential pool or roofing
audiences: they are environmental managers, EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) directors,
civil and environmental engineers, project managers at contaminated land consultancies, public
sector environmental officers, and legal teams managing environmental liability under
DL 147/2008. The content must operate at a level of technical precision that inspires confidence
from this audience — while also communicating the business and regulatory case clearly enough
for non-technical stakeholders (directors, solicitors, insurers).

The persuasion architecture is built around risk management and liability, not aesthetic or
convenience arguments. The Portuguese regulatory framework (APA, DL 147/2008, DL 183/2009)
provides a strong anchor: environmental liability is not theoretical, it is legally codified
with financial consequences. Containment is the engineering control that limits that liability.
EPDM is the material that executes containment reliably across the chemical and mechanical
conditions of environmental service.

The page must also address the competitive landscape honestly: HDPE dominates large-scale
landfill work, and specifiers know this. Membriko's differentiated position is in applications
where EPDM's flexibility, chemical breadth, and adaptability to complex geometry outperform
HDPE — industrial secondary containment, bund lining, remediation caps, and complex site
geometries where HDPE's stiffness is a practical problem.

## Section 1: Introduction — Soil and Groundwater Contamination in Portugal

**Purpose:** Establish the scale and reality of contamination risk in Portugal, creating
immediate relevance for the environmental professional audience.

**Content:**
- The Portuguese contamination landscape: mining legacy in the Alentejo (Iberian Pyrite Belt),
  chemical industry contamination in Sines, Barreiro, Estarreja, urban brownfield sites in
  Lisboa and Porto, agricultural chemical accumulation in the Tejo and Sado valleys
- The regulatory consequence: DL 147/2008 establishes strict liability for environmental damage;
  the "polluter pays" principle means operators of industrial and waste facilities face direct
  financial exposure for contamination that reaches soil, groundwater, or surface water
- The engineering response: containment systems — secondary containment bunds, remediation caps,
  spill containment berms, liner systems under storage tanks and lagoons — are the primary
  engineering controls that prevent contamination from occurring or from migrating once released
- Membriko's position: EPDM geomembrane systems for environmental containment; technically
  validated across the chemical environments of Portuguese industrial and environmental sites;
  installed with the precision that containment applications demand
- Stat block: 50+ year service life / chemical resistance across pH 2-12 / ≥ 300% elongation /
  20-year Membriko installation warranty

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Containment Applications

**Purpose:** The technical case for EPDM selection, directed at specifiers and engineers.

**Content:**
- Core chemistry: the saturated polymer backbone; absence of reactive double bonds; intrinsic
  resistance to oxidising agents, acids, alkalis, and ozone without sacrificial additives
- Comparison with thermoplastic geomembranes (HDPE, LLDPE): EPDM's 300-500% elongation vs
  HDPE's 12-30%; EPDM's freedom from environmental stress cracking; EPDM's flexibility in
  cold conditions; EPDM's adaptability to complex geometry
- Chemical resistance spectrum: acids (HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃), alkalis (NaOH, KOH), oxidising
  agents (NaOCl, H₂O₂, O₃), aqueous salt solutions, heavy metal leachates, MSW leachate
- Relevant standards: EN 13361 (geomembranes for artificial reservoirs), EN 14991 (geomembranes
  for solid waste facilities), GRI-GM19 (EPDM geomembrane specification), EN 13956 (flexible
  sheets for waterproofing)
- Physical properties table

## Section 3: Application Types — Four Containment Scenarios

**Purpose:** Establish Membriko's competence across the full spectrum of containment applications.
Four cards, each addressing a distinct market segment.

**Card 1: Secondary Containment Bunds (Bacias de Retenção Secundária)**
- Definition: containment systems around storage tanks, drum stores, chemical fill points, and
  transfer areas designed to capture 110% of the volume of the largest tank in the bunded area
- Regulatory driver: DL 147/2008, IED requirements, insurance conditions for chemical storage
- EPDM advantage: chemical resistance across the range of stored products; flexibility to
  conform to bund floor geometry; single-membrane continuity from floor to bund wall without
  rigid-to-flexible transitions that create stress concentration

**Card 2: Bund Lining (Revestimento de Diques e Bacias)**
- Definition: lining of earthen or concrete bunds for liquid industrial waste, process water,
  effluent treatment lagoons, and leachate storage
- EPDM advantage: conformity to earthen embankment slopes without anchoring membrane;
  resistance to the complex leachate chemistry in lagoon applications; large panel widths
  minimise seams on simple geometries

**Card 3: Spill Containment (Contenção de Derrames)**
- Definition: temporary or permanent spill containment systems for emergency response, tank
  farm areas, transfer terminals, and loading bays
- EPDM advantage: rapid deployment of pre-fabricated EPDM containment berms; resistance to
  the wide range of substances likely to be encountered in emergency spill scenarios; flexibility
  allows deployment on uneven ground without membrane damage

**Card 4: Remediation Caps (Coberturas para Remediação de Solos Contaminados)**
- Definition: low-permeability caps installed over contaminated soil to prevent rainwater
  infiltration that generates leachate and to limit vapour migration to the atmosphere
- EPDM advantage: excellent elongation accommodates differential settlement in capped areas;
  root resistance (relevant when revegetated caps are specified); UV stability allows
  temporary surface exposure during phased construction; compatibility with geotextile
  protection layers

## Section 4: Chemical Resistance Spectrum

**Purpose:** Provide the detailed chemical resistance information that specifiers and EHS
managers need for material selection decisions.

**Content:**
- Explanation of how EPDM's saturated backbone creates intrinsic chemical resistance
- Chemical resistance matrix for the principal contaminant groups encountered in Portugal:
  - Inorganic acids: HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃, H₃PO₄ — excellent resistance
  - Alkalis: NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)₂, ammonia — excellent resistance
  - Oxidising agents: NaOCl, H₂O₂, ozone — excellent resistance (critical advantage over
    unsaturated rubbers and some thermoplastic geomembranes)
  - Aqueous salt solutions and heavy metal leachates: excellent resistance
  - Municipal landfill leachate (complex organic and inorganic mixture): excellent resistance
  - Aliphatic hydrocarbons: moderate resistance — swelling occurs; not recommended for primary
    containment of pure hydrocarbon streams
  - Aromatic hydrocarbons: limited resistance — HDPE preferred; Membriko provides selection
    guidance for mixed contamination scenarios
- Note on honest limitations: Membriko provides material selection guidance for each project;
  where EPDM is not the optimal material, Membriko says so

## Section 7: EPDM vs HDPE, PVC, and GCL Systems

**Purpose:** Honest competitive comparison for the technical audience. Framed as material
selection guidance, not competitive attack.

**Content:** Comparison table.

| Characteristic | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE | PVC Geomembrane | GCL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | 300-500% | 12-30% | 150-250% | N/A |
| Environmental stress cracking | Not susceptible | Susceptible | Not susceptible | N/A |
| Cold temperature flexibility | -45°C | -10°C (embrittles) | -20°C (stiffens) | N/A |
| Acid and alkali resistance | Excellent | Good | Moderate | Good |
| Hydrocarbon resistance | Moderate | Excellent | Poor | Good |
| Irregular geometry | Excellent | Moderate | Good | Moderate |
| Seaming method | QuickSeam (adhesive) | Hot wedge welding | Hot air / solvent | Overlapping with bentonite paste |
| Cost per m² (relative) | Medium | Low-Medium | Low | Low |
| Service life | 50+ years | 50+ years | 20-30 years | 50+ years (as mineral component) |

Honest text: HDPE is the cost-effective choice for large-scale, regular-geometry landfill
applications with established regulatory acceptance. For applications requiring flexibility,
broad chemical resistance across non-hydrocarbon chemistry, and adaptability to complex or
irregular site geometry, EPDM is the technically superior choice. Membriko provides honest
material selection guidance — including recommending HDPE where it is the better solution.

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture the specific long-tail search intent of the environmental professional
audience and address common technical and commercial objections.

1. **O EPDM é aprovado para contenção de resíduos perigosos em Portugal?**
   EPDM meets the geomembrane technical requirements of DL 183/2009 and is compatible with
   APA requirements for containment systems at regulated sites when installed to the specified
   thickness (minimum 2.0 mm for hazardous waste) with quality-assured seaming and testing.
   Project-specific regulatory acceptance is confirmed during the design phase.

2. **Qual a diferença entre EPDM e HDPE para contenção ambiental?**
   EPDM offers superior elongation (300-500% vs 12-30% for HDPE), resistance to environmental
   stress cracking, and flexibility at low temperatures. HDPE offers lower cost for large-scale
   regular-geometry applications and better resistance to pure hydrocarbons. The Membriko
   technical team provides material selection guidance for each project's specific chemical
   and geometric requirements.

3. **Posso usar EPDM para contenção de combustíveis e hidrocarbonetos?**
   Pure aliphatic hydrocarbon containment (petrol, diesel, heating oil) is not the optimal
   use for EPDM — HDPE or LLDPE are preferred for primary containment of pure hydrocarbon
   streams. For secondary containment bunds around petroleum storage where contact is
   intermittent (spill scenario only), EPDM is used in practice. Membriko provides specific
   guidance for each application.

4. **Como é feita a detecção de fugas numa geomembrana EPDM?**
   Electrical Leak Location (ELL) testing is performed after installation and before placement
   of protective cover layers. The water-lance method wets the upper membrane surface while
   electrodes on the underside detect current anomalies at defects. For critical applications,
   permanent electrode grids provide real-time monitoring. Membriko includes ELL testing as
   standard for containment projects above defined risk thresholds.

5. **O EPDM aguenta drenagem ácida de minas (AMD)?**
   Yes. EPDM has excellent resistance to the low pH, high metal loading conditions of acid
   mine drainage (pH as low as 2, high concentrations of iron, zinc, copper, arsenic). This is
   documented in both laboratory immersion data and field performance at mine waste management
   facilities in Europe and globally. EPDM is the preferred geomembrane for AMD containment
   in European practice.

6. **Qual a espessura mínima recomendada para contenção ambiental?**
   For primary containment of aqueous waste streams with moderate chemical aggressiveness,
   1.5 mm is the minimum; 2.0 mm is standard specification for most environmental containment.
   For hazardous waste, high mechanical damage risk, or highly aggressive chemical conditions,
   2.5 mm is specified. Membriko specifies membrane thickness based on the specific site
   conditions and regulatory requirements of each project.

7. **A Membriko tem experiência em projectos de remediação de solos contaminados?**
   Yes. Membriko has installed EPDM containment cap and barrier systems in brownfield
   remediation projects across Portugal, working as specialist geomembrane contractor within
   project teams led by environmental consultants. Experience covers acid mine drainage sites,
   industrial brownfields, and urban contaminated land remediation projects.

8. **Quanto tempo demora a instalação de um sistema de contenção EPDM?**
   Installation time depends on project scale and complexity. A secondary containment bund
   for an industrial storage tank (typically 100-500 m²) takes 2-5 days including substrate
   preparation, membrane installation, seaming, and leak testing. Larger cap systems and
   complex multi-zone containment projects are scheduled on a project-specific basis.
   Membriko provides programme information at the proposal stage.
