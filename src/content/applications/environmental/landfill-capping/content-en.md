# Landfill Capping and Closure Systems with EPDM Geomembrane

## Section 1: Portuguese Landfill Management and the Capping Challenge

Portugal's landfill infrastructure tells the story of a country that transformed its waste management system within a single generation. Before EU accession and the legislation that followed it, open dumpsites — lixeiras — were the norm across much of the country. The systematic programme of investment in engineered aterros sanitários that began in earnest through the 1990s replaced those sites with compliant sanitary landfills built to European standards. The 23 inter-municipal Sistemas de Gestão de Resíduos Urbanos (SGRU) that now cover the entire Portuguese mainland represent one of the most thorough overhauls of waste infrastructure on the Iberian Peninsula.

That investment programme was enormously successful at eliminating illegal and uncontrolled disposal. It also created a pipeline of engineering work that is now reaching maturity: the cells built and filled during the 1990s and early 2000s are at or approaching their design capacity. Many are entering, or have recently entered, the closure phase — the point at which a final cap system must be installed to seal the waste body permanently from the environment above it.

The strategic context accelerates this closure pipeline further. Under PERSU 2030 — Portugal's Plano Estratégico para os Resíduos Urbanos published in 2021 — the national target is to reduce landfilling of municipal solid waste to a maximum of 10% of total waste generated by 2035. Portugal landfilled approximately 60% of its municipal solid waste in 2010; reaching the 10% target by 2035 requires not merely operational changes but the progressive closure of active cells as recycling, composting, and mechanical-biological treatment capacity expands. The consequence is a sustained wave of final cap installations across the country throughout the 2020s and into the 2030s.

Closing a landfill is not simply a matter of laying soil over the top. The final cap system is a multi-layer engineered structure with a functional life measured in decades, regulated in Portugal by Decreto-Lei n.º 183/2009 (which transposes EU Council Directive 1999/31/EC, the Landfill Directive) and overseen by APA — the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente. The cap must simultaneously accomplish several distinct engineering tasks: prevent surface water from infiltrating the waste mass and generating leachate; collect and divert landfill gas to controlled extraction points; provide a stable base for vegetation that integrates the closed site into the landscape; and — most critically — maintain its hydraulic integrity throughout decades of differential settlement as the waste mass beneath it continues to compact and decompose.

That final requirement — accommodation of differential settlement — is the defining engineering challenge of landfill capping. Municipal solid waste is one of the most compressible materials in civil engineering. It continues to settle under its own weight and through biological decomposition long after filling has ended. Differential settlement across a large landfill can reach one to three metres over distances of ten to twenty metres. A final cap geomembrane must absorb those strains without tearing, cracking, or developing hydraulic breaches that would allow water to infiltrate the waste or gas to escape uncontrolled.

Membriko, based in Pombal, Leiria, installs EPDM geomembranes for landfill final cap systems that comply with DL 183/2009 and deliver the performance required over the 30-year minimum post-closure monitoring period mandated by Portuguese law. This document explains in technical detail why EPDM is the most appropriate geomembrane for cap applications, how Membriko designs and installs cap systems, and what operators and their environmental consultants need to know when specifying a landfill closure system.

## Section 2: Why EPDM Is the Right Material for Landfill Cap Geomembranes

The requirements of a landfill cap geomembrane are fundamentally different from those of a base liner geomembrane. A base liner sits beneath the waste under continuous compressive stress from overburden; its critical properties are resistance to leachate chemistry, compressive load, and hydrostatic pressure. A cap geomembrane sits above the waste under tensile and flexural stress from differential settlement, thermal cycling, and wind loading; its critical properties are elongation, UV stability, resistance to biogas, root resistance, and low-temperature flexibility.

Membriko specifies EPDM geomembrane for landfill cap applications because EPDM's material properties match this set of requirements more precisely than any alternative. The comparison is not one of convenience — it is grounded in the polymer chemistry and field performance data of each material.

### Elongation: The Primary Design Property for Cap Geomembranes

The single most important property of a landfill cap geomembrane is elongation at break — the capacity to stretch under tensile strain without failing. EPDM geomembrane at cap grade achieves elongation at break values of 300% to 450% in standard testing to EN 12311-2. This is not a marginal advantage: it is the difference between a membrane that accommodates the working strains of a settling landfill with a large safety factor to spare, and one that may be operating near its failure threshold.

A representative differential settlement scenario for a Portuguese aterro sanitário — one metre of differential settlement across a ten-metre span — generates approximately 10% tensile strain in the cap geomembrane at the point of maximum curvature. For Membriko EPDM with 400% elongation, the safety factor against rupture at this strain demand is approximately 40. No design code requires a safety factor remotely close to this; the practical implication is that even severe differential settlement events are absorbed elastically by the EPDM membrane without any structural consequence.

EPDM's response to this strain is also elastic rather than plastic: when the settlement stabilises, the membrane returns towards its original form. There is no accumulation of residual deformation, no stress cracking propagation, and no permanent reduction in hydraulic integrity.

### UV Stability: Long-Term Surface Durability

Cap geomembranes, unlike base liners, are exposed to solar UV radiation — during the construction period before the drainage layer and topsoil are placed, and in perpetuity wherever the vegetation cover is incomplete. Portugal's solar resource is among the highest in Europe: global horizontal irradiance ranges from approximately 1,600 kWh/m² per year in the Minho to 2,200 kWh/m² in the Algarve, with peak UV index values of 10 to 11 in midsummer across the south. Any geomembrane installed on a landfill cap must withstand this exposure without degradation.

EPDM's polymer backbone — an ethylene-propylene copolymer with pendant diene termonomer groups — is saturated at the main chain, making it intrinsically resistant to UV-induced chain scission. Carbon black loading at 30 to 50 parts per hundred rubber (phr) provides additional UV absorption capacity. Accelerated weathering tests to ASTM G154 (xenon arc irradiation) demonstrate tensile strength retention above 90% and elongation retention above 85% after 10,000 hours of exposure — equivalent to more than 50 years of outdoor service at Portuguese UV levels, depending on latitude. There is no surface cracking, chalking, or delamination.

Membriko sources cap-grade EPDM with verified UV stability data as a standard product requirement. For landfill sites in the Algarve or the Alentejo, where UV exposure is most intense and where Mediterranean vegetation cover may be slower to establish than in the wetter north, this property is particularly critical.

### Chemical Resistance: Biogas and Leachate Compatibility

Landfill gas from municipal solid waste sites is a complex mixture: typically 45% to 60% methane (CH₄), 35% to 50% carbon dioxide (CO₂), with trace quantities of hydrogen sulphide (H₂S), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrogen. The cap geomembrane is exposed to this gas mixture on its underside throughout the post-closure period.

EPDM demonstrates excellent resistance to all components of typical landfill gas. Its permeability to methane is very low — comparable to HDPE at equivalent thickness — ensuring that gas is directed through the drainage layer below the membrane to active collection points rather than diffusing directly through the geomembrane. Resistance to hydrogen sulphide at concentrations up to 500 ppm has been demonstrated in immersion testing to ASTM D471 with no measurable degradation in physical properties. Membriko specifies only EPDM formulations with documented biogas resistance data as part of the product certification package provided to APA.

### Root Resistance: Long-Term Integrity Under Vegetation

The cover soil layer above the cap geomembrane progressively establishes a vegetation community over years to decades. Herbaceous meadow vegetation is the most common target condition, but volunteer woody species can establish naturally on landfill covers, and some closure plans include woodland establishment with one-metre-deep topsoil. Root systems from established vegetation exert sustained penetration pressure on the geomembrane below the soil layer.

EPDM's root resistance has been established in the context of intensive green roof applications to the FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau) root resistance test protocol and to EN 13948, where root penetration pressure from established shrubs and trees is sustained for decades without membrane failure. The same resistance applies to landfill cover vegetation. In over 30 years of monitored EPDM performance in covered applications, no root penetration failure has been documented in correctly installed membranes. Membriko applies the same installation quality standards to landfill cap projects as to green roof and reservoir applications, where this property has been proven in practice.

### Low-Temperature Flexibility: Reliable Performance in Winter Conditions

Landfill cap installation in Portugal is not confined to mild coastal sites. Aterros sanitários in northern and interior regions — Trás-os-Montes, the Serra da Estrela foothills, the northern Minho — experience installation conditions approaching 0°C in winter, and occasional frost. The cap geomembrane must remain fully flexible at these temperatures for installation to proceed without material damage, and must withstand subsequent thermal cycling without stress cracking at low temperatures.

EPDM's glass transition temperature of -60°C to -50°C makes it fully pliable at any temperature encountered in Portuguese outdoor conditions. There is no stiffening, no increase in brittleness, and no risk of cold-temperature cracking during installation or during service. This is a material property advantage over HDPE geomembrane, which begins to stiffen at temperatures below approximately 10°C and can develop brittleness at weld seams or anchor trench locations during cold-weather thermal cycling.

## Section 3: Cap System Layers — The Complete Engineering Stack

A final cap system for a non-hazardous municipal solid waste landfill, compliant with Annex I, Section 3 of Decreto-Lei n.º 183/2009, comprises six distinct layers arranged from the surface of the waste mass to the atmosphere above. Membriko designs and supplies the geomembrane element of this system and coordinates its installation with the other layers constructed by civil contractors.

### Layer 1: Prepared Waste Surface

Before any cap layer is installed, the surface of the waste mass is compacted and graded to the design profile. DL 183/2009 requires a minimum slope of 3% on cap surfaces to promote surface runoff and prevent ponding. In practice, Membriko recommends slopes of 3% to 5% on flat cap areas and steeper slopes on the flanks — typically 18% to 33% (1:5.5 to 1:3) — to ensure adequate drainage whilst maintaining slope stability for the geomembrane and cover layers.

Membriko carries out a pre-installation UAV topographic survey of the waste surface to identify deviations from the design profile, areas of uneven settlement, and locations requiring remedial grading. This survey also provides the baseline against which subsequent post-closure settlement monitoring surveys are compared.

### Layer 2: Gas Collection and Drainage Layer

Directly above the prepared waste surface, a gas collection and drainage layer allows landfill gas migrating upward from the decomposing waste to travel horizontally to extraction risers or passive vents. This layer is typically constructed from coarse granular aggregate (20 to 40 mm clean stone) at 0.3 to 0.5 metres thickness, or from a geocomposite drainage mat with equivalent hydraulic and gas transmissivity.

Perforated collection pipes are installed within this layer at regular intervals, connected to the vertical extraction riser network. The gas drainage layer functions as a plenum — maintaining a zone of low resistance through which gas can migrate freely to collection points without building up pressure that would exert uplift force on the EPDM geomembrane above. Membriko coordinates the design of the gas drainage layer with the geomembrane layout to ensure that no panel seam or anchor trench location coincides with a gas pressure accumulation point.

### Layer 3: Mineral Sealing Layer

Annex I of DL 183/2009 requires a mineral sealing layer with hydraulic conductivity k ≤ 10⁻⁹ m/s and minimum thickness of 0.5 m for non-hazardous waste landfills. This layer is typically constructed from compacted clay with appropriate plasticity index and particle size distribution, or from equivalent engineered materials such as soil-bentonite mixtures or treated slag.

Compacted clay is an effective hydraulic barrier when maintained at or near saturation. Its vulnerability in cap applications is desiccation cracking: during hot, dry Portuguese summers — which are characteristic of the Alentejo, Algarve, and interior Beiras regions — the clay surface can dry and crack if the cover above it is thin or poorly established, increasing hydraulic conductivity by several orders of magnitude. The EPDM geomembrane installed directly above the mineral layer protects it from desiccation, maintaining it in a consistently moist condition regardless of surface conditions. The combination of mineral layer and EPDM creates a dual-barrier system that far exceeds the regulatory minimum and provides redundancy against failure of either component.

### Layer 4: EPDM Geomembrane (Membriko)

The Membriko EPDM geomembrane — at 1.14 mm to 1.52 mm thickness for standard cap applications, or 2.0 mm for exposed or high-settlement-risk conditions — is the primary hydraulic barrier and the most critical element of the cap system. It is installed above the mineral sealing layer, with perimeter and intermediate anchor trenches providing mechanical fixity against settlement-induced displacement and thermal movement.

Membriko installs EPDM cap membranes using the Firestone RubberGard system: large-format panels in widths up to 15.25 m are positioned and field-seamed using QuickPrime Plus primer and 150 mm QuickSeam tape. Each field seam is recorded by GPS coordinates and photographic documentation, and tested by peel strength sampling at intervals specified in the project quality assurance plan. Every gas collection pipe penetration through the EPDM is sealed with a purpose-formed EPDM pipe boot and stainless steel compression flange, individually seal-tested by electrical leak location before the drainage layer is placed.

### Layer 5: Drainage and Protection Layer

Immediately above the EPDM geomembrane, a drainage and protection layer serves two functions simultaneously: collecting precipitation that percolates through the cover soil and directing it to perimeter drains, and providing mechanical protection for the membrane against puncture from stone content in the overlying topsoil.

Membriko specifies a geocomposite drainage mat — geotextile filter layer, three-dimensional drainage core, and geotextile protection layer — or a 0.3 m granular drainage layer with geotextile interfaces, depending on the site geometry and available materials. The drainage layer is designed to convey the design precipitation event without developing head that would create uplift on the EPDM above.

### Layer 6: Restoration and Recultivation Layer

The uppermost layer is the cover soil that supports vegetation establishment and provides thermal insulation for the geomembrane below. DL 183/2009 specifies minimum thicknesses that vary with vegetation type: 0.6 to 1.0 m for herbaceous grassland and scrub, 1.0 to 1.5 m for woodland planting. The topsoil layer insulates the EPDM from extreme surface temperatures in summer — which on exposed dark geomembrane surfaces in Portugal can reach 60°C or above — and provides frost protection in northern regions.

Membriko advises on topsoil specification and vegetation establishment as part of the overall cap system design, recognising that the long-term performance of the EPDM depends on stable, well-established vegetation cover that minimises UV exposure and prevents erosion of the protective soil layer.

## Section 4: Gas Collection Integration with the EPDM Cap

The integration of the biogas collection system with the cap geomembrane is one of the most technically demanding aspects of landfill capping — and one that distinguishes an experienced landfill geomembrane contractor from a standard waterproofing installer. Membriko brings specific technical competence to this interface, developed through landfill cap projects where gas management requirements directly influence the geomembrane design.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas: its global warming potential over a 20-year horizon is 84 times that of carbon dioxide. Uncontrolled methane emissions from landfills represent one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas from the waste sector. Decreto-Lei n.º 183/2009 requires active gas collection at all MSW landfills with significant gas production rates. An intact, well-installed EPDM cap maximises gas collection efficiency — preventing atmospheric oxygen from entering the waste mass (which would suppress methanogenic bacteria and reduce gas productivity) and preventing methane from escaping to atmosphere at any point outside the active collection system.

### Active Gas Extraction Systems

For landfills with significant gas generation — typically sites with substantial quantities of younger, more organic waste — active gas extraction maintains sub-atmospheric pressure in the drainage layer below the EPDM cap. A network of vertical extraction wells, each sealed through the EPDM using Membriko's purpose-detailed pipe boot penetrations, connects to a header manifold and compressor system. The sub-atmospheric pressure in the gas drainage layer means that atmospheric pressure above the EPDM always exceeds gas pressure below it — there is no net uplift force on the membrane, and gas cannot escape except through the extraction system.

The Membriko EPDM pipe boot detail for gas extraction risers uses a formed EPDM sleeve bonded to the membrane with QuickSeam bonding agent, secured with a stainless steel compression flange bolted to a purpose-formed EPDM collar. This detail is identical in principle to the pipe boot penetration details used in Membriko's roofing and reservoir projects — the geometry differs, but the material technology and seal quality are the same. Each penetration is individually tested by electrical leak location (ELL) before the drainage layer and topsoil are placed.

Several of Portugal's major waste management operators — including Valorsul, whose Aterro Sanitário de São João da Talha incorporates a landfill gas-to-energy (LFGE) system — already demonstrate the economic case for high-quality gas capture. The revenue from LFGE electricity generation, supported by RENO feed-in tariff mechanisms, partially offsets post-closure management costs. Membriko EPDM cap installation that maximises cap integrity directly maximises the gas capture efficiency and therefore the economic return from these systems.

### Passive Gas Venting

Smaller landfills, older sites with reduced gas productivity, or cells where active extraction is not economically justified use passive venting: gas vents at defined intervals allow gas to exit the cap to atmosphere without active extraction. These vents — perforated polyethylene pipes wrapped in granular or geotextile filter material, fitted with rain-excluding caps at the surface — must be positioned and detailed so that gas pressure does not build up between vent locations and create uplift on the EPDM between them.

Membriko designs passive vent spacing based on the estimated gas generation rate for the specific waste mass, typically placing vents at intervals of 0.25 to 1.0 hectares depending on gas production intensity. The EPDM at each passive vent penetration is detailed and tested with the same rigour as an active extraction penetration.

## Section 5: Installation on the Irregular Terrain of a Landfill Surface

A landfill surface at the point of closure is one of the most demanding installation environments that a geomembrane can encounter. It is not a flat, clean, geometrically regular substrate. It is a complex landscape of compacted waste at varying elevations, created by years of progressive filling, compaction, and settlement, intersected by buried drainage infrastructure, gas collection pipes, and the boundaries between cells filled at different times. Surface irregularities of 0.5 to 2.0 metres in height across short horizontal distances are common.

Membriko addresses this complexity through a structured pre-installation process and material choices that are suited to the terrain.

### UAV Topographic Survey

Before mobilising installation crews, Membriko conducts a UAV-mounted photogrammetric or LiDAR topographic survey of the waste surface. The resulting digital terrain model, with ground resolution of 10 to 20 centimetres, supports panel layout planning — determining the optimum cutting geometry for each EPDM panel to minimise field waste whilst achieving complete coverage with the minimum number of seams. It also identifies areas requiring remedial grading before membrane placement, and establishes the spatial framework for post-closure settlement monitoring.

### Large-Format Panels — Minimising Field Seams

EPDM geomembrane can be supplied in panel widths of up to 15.25 metres and custom-cut lengths of several hundred metres. For a typical Portuguese aterro cell of two to five hectares, this means covering the area with five to eight large panels rather than the thirty to fifty rolls that would be required with standard-width HDPE geomembrane. Every seam eliminated is a potential leakage point eliminated. Membriko's panel layout planning, based on the UAV terrain model, maximises this advantage by aligning panel boundaries with the natural topographic features of the site rather than imposing a grid that creates unnecessary seaming at awkward locations.

### Natural Conformance to Irregular Surfaces

EPDM's low elastic modulus and 400% elongation capacity mean that the membrane conforms naturally to surface undulations without wrinkling or developing stress concentrations. When an EPDM panel is positioned on an irregular surface, it follows the contour of the ground without the thermal manipulation that HDPE requires to relax thermally induced wrinkles. This natural conformance reduces installation time, eliminates the equipment needed for HDPE panel heating, and avoids the localised property changes that can result from heat treatment.

### Anchor Trench Design

The perimeter of the EPDM cap is secured in anchor trenches excavated in competent soil or compacted fill outside the waste mass boundary. Intermediate anchor trenches may also be required at internal terraces or at the transitions between flat-topped cells and side slopes. Membriko designs anchor trench geometry — depth, width, backfill specification — to accommodate the maximum calculated displacement from the combination of differential settlement and thermal movement, with a factor of safety against anchor pullout appropriate to the site-specific loading conditions.

### Slope Installation Sequence

On the side slopes of the landfill, Membriko installs EPDM panels working from the crest downwards. Each panel is overlapped over the panel below it (downslope overlap) so that any precipitation running down the membrane surface during the installation period passes over seams rather than through them. The final bonded seam is applied only after all panels are positioned and their geometry verified — a procedure that eliminates the risk of water infiltration through partially bonded seams during installation.

### Field Seam Quality Assurance

Every field seam in the Membriko EPDM cap installation is documented with GPS coordinates, photographic records, and peel strength test results from samples taken at intervals defined in the project QA plan. The seam records form part of the as-built documentation package submitted to the client and, where required by the licence conditions, to APA.

## Section 6: Settlement Accommodation — EPDM Flexibility as the Engineering Solution

Of all the properties that distinguish EPDM from alternative geomembranes for landfill cap applications, the ability to accommodate differential settlement is the most consequential in practice. Membriko presents this argument with engineering data, because the specifiers and procurement officers for landfill closure projects deserve quantitative analysis, not assertions.

### The Scale of Settlement in MSW Landfills

Municipal solid waste is extraordinarily compressible. Three distinct settlement mechanisms operate over different timescales:

**Primary mechanical compression** occurs relatively quickly after waste placement. Under the overburden of a typical Portuguese aterro with a waste height of 20 to 30 metres (waste density 0.7 to 1.0 t/m³), primary compression typically produces 5% to 15% of initial waste height within the first five years after filling.

**Secondary compression and biodegradation** is slower but prolonged — driven by biological decomposition of the organic fraction, loss of gas volume, and creep of the waste matrix under sustained load. This process can continue for 20 to 50 years post-closure, producing an additional 5% to 20% of initial waste height in cumulative settlement.

**Differential settlement** is the most critical for cap integrity. It arises from spatial variations in waste type, compaction density, moisture content, and age across the landfill footprint; from differences in waste thickness between adjacent cells; and from the different behaviour of buried infrastructure (drainage pipes, gas collection mains) compared with the surrounding waste. Differential settlements of one to three metres across spans of ten to twenty metres are not exceptional at Portuguese aterros sanitários in the years following closure.

### How Membriko EPDM Responds to Settlement

A one-metre differential settlement across a ten-metre horizontal span generates a tensile strain of approximately 10% in the cap geomembrane at the point of maximum curvature. Against Membriko EPDM's elongation at break of 350% to 450%, this represents a safety margin of 35 to 45 — vastly exceeding any engineering design factor of safety applied in practice for geomembrane integrity. The EPDM absorbs the strain elastically: there is no yielding, no plastic deformation, no initiation of stress cracking, and no reduction in hydraulic barrier performance. As settlement stabilises over subsequent years, the membrane recovers towards its initial form.

Even in extreme cases — two metres of differential settlement across a ten-metre span, which would be considered a severe event at any Portuguese MSW landfill — the resulting tensile strain of approximately 20% remains well within EPDM's elastic range. Membriko EPDM cap membranes are designed with this margin built in as a fundamental material property, not as an additional design measure.

### How HDPE Responds to Settlement

High-density polyethylene geomembrane presents a different picture in cap applications. HDPE has elongation at break values of 300% to 600% in unnotched laboratory specimens — figures that suggest adequate settlement accommodation. The field reality is substantially different for three reasons.

First, HDPE yields at approximately 12% to 18% elongation (the yield point at which the material transitions from elastic to plastic behaviour). Beyond yield, HDPE deforms permanently and does not recover elastically. A landfill that experiences repeated settlement cycles — which is the norm, as biological decomposition proceeds in pulses — will progressively accumulate plastic deformation in the HDPE cap until it approaches rupture.

Second, HDPE is susceptible to environmental stress cracking (ESC) — a form of slow crack growth that occurs at stresses well below the yield stress, in the presence of surface-active compounds. Leachate from MSW landfills contains surfactants from household detergents and biological breakdown products that can act as ESC agents on the underside of the HDPE cap geomembrane. Published failure analyses of HDPE cap geomembranes on European landfills have identified ESC as the dominant long-term failure mechanism — the one most likely to cause loss of hydraulic integrity in the post-closure period when inspection frequency is lowest.

Third, HDPE's thermal expansion coefficient (approximately 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ /°C) is roughly three times that of EPDM (approximately 0.7 × 10⁻⁴ /°C). On a 100-metre-wide landfill cap subject to a 40°C temperature swing between winter night and summer day, an HDPE panel expands and contracts by approximately 600 mm — generating surface wrinkles and cyclical stress at anchor trenches that contribute to fatigue cracking over time.

EPDM is not susceptible to stress cracking. Its failure mode under sustained tensile load is viscoelastic creep — a progressive, predictable, and observable deformation that does not lead to sudden brittle failure. Membriko EPDM cap installations are designed to remain hydraulically intact through the entire 30-year post-closure monitoring period without the risk of sudden ESC-induced failure that characterises long-term HDPE cap performance.

## Section 7: EPDM Compared with HDPE Geomembrane and GCL

Membriko presents material comparisons with technical rigour and intellectual honesty. HDPE is a well-established and effective material for landfill base liner applications, where its properties under compressive overburden and sustained leachate exposure are appropriate. For cap applications, the specific properties of EPDM are more advantageous across almost every relevant criterion.

| Property | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | GCL (Bentonite) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | 300–450% | 300–600%* | < 10% |
| Stress cracking susceptibility | None (not a molecular mechanism) | Present (ESC under sustained load and surfactants) | N/A |
| Thermal expansion coefficient | ~0.7 × 10⁻⁴ /°C (low) | ~1.5 × 10⁻⁴ /°C (3× EPDM) | N/A |
| UV stability (covered application) | Excellent — 100+ years projected | Good — 60–80 years estimated | Poor (bentonite unaffected; geotextile degrades) |
| Settlement accommodation | Excellent — elastic to 400%+ | Moderate — yields at 12–18%; ESC risk | Very poor — tensile failure at < 10% elongation |
| Desiccation risk | None — impermeable regardless of moisture | None | High — permeability increases by 3–4 orders of magnitude when dry |
| Root resistance | Excellent (FLL test / EN 13948 certified) | Good | Moderate — geotextile layers vulnerable |
| Field seam method | Adhesive tape — robust, low skill-sensitivity | Thermal weld — quality sensitive to operator skill, temperature, and surface condition | Needle-punched lapping — robust but relies on hydration for sealing |
| Thermal wrinkling on large panels | Minimal | Significant (wrinkles of ±5 cm/m common) | N/A |
| Low-temperature flexibility | Fully flexible to -60°C | Stiffens below ~10°C | N/A |

*HDPE elongation at break in unnotched laboratory specimens significantly overestimates field performance under sustained multi-directional load in the presence of ESC agents.

### A Note on GCL in Portuguese Conditions

Geosynthetic clay liner has excellent hydraulic performance when fully hydrated (hydraulic conductivity approximately 10⁻¹¹ m/s), but its fundamental vulnerability in cap applications is desiccation. When the bentonite clay dries out — as it will during hot Portuguese summers if the overlying soil is thin or poorly vegetated — it shrinks and cracks, and hydraulic conductivity can increase by three to four orders of magnitude from the design value. Membriko does not recommend GCL as the primary sealing element in landfill cap systems under Portuguese climatic conditions. The dry, hot summers characteristic of the Alentejo, Algarve, and most interior regions make GCL desiccation a real, not a theoretical, risk over a 30-year monitoring period.

## Section 8: Regulatory Framework — DL 183/2009, the EU Landfill Directive, and PERSU 2030

Membriko designs landfill cap systems from the regulatory framework outward. Understanding the legal requirements in detail — not merely their existence — is essential for producing cap system specifications that satisfy APA's licensing and acceptance criteria without unnecessary conservatism that drives cost.

### Decreto-Lei n.º 183/2009

DL 183/2009 is the primary Portuguese legislation governing landfill engineering. It transposes EU Council Directive 1999/31/EC and its annexes into Portuguese law. The technical requirements for final cap systems are set out in Annex I, Section 3 (Closure and Aftercare Procedures).

For non-hazardous waste landfills — the category that covers municipal solid waste aterros sanitários — DL 183/2009 requires:

- A mineral sealing layer with hydraulic conductivity k ≤ 10⁻⁹ m/s and minimum thickness 0.5 m
- An artificial geomembrane liner above the mineral layer, where required by site-specific risk assessment
- A drainage layer above the sealing system sufficient to manage the design precipitation
- A recultivation layer of adequate thickness and quality for the vegetation type specified in the closure plan
- Slopes sufficient to promote surface runoff without causing erosion (minimum 3% in practice)

For hazardous waste landfills, the requirements are more stringent: the geomembrane is mandatory (not conditional on risk assessment), and the minimum equivalent hydraulic performance corresponds to a 2.0 mm HDPE geomembrane — which EPDM at 1.52 mm to 2.0 mm satisfies in terms of hydraulic conductivity, whilst offering superior elongation, UV stability, and ESC resistance.

Membriko provides the complete certification documentation package for EPDM geomembrane to APA standard as part of every landfill cap project delivery. This includes CE-marked product conformity declarations, independent test reports to EN 1849-2, EN 12311-2, EN 12310-2, EN 1928, ASTM G154, and the EN 13361 geosynthetic barrier standard, together with the as-built installation quality records.

### APA Oversight and Post-Closure Monitoring

APA — the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente — is the competent authority for landfill licensing, operation, closure, and post-closure monitoring. The post-closure monitoring period defined by DL 183/2009 is a minimum of 30 years from the date of closure, with APA having discretion to extend this period where monitoring data indicates continued environmental risk. APA retains a financial guarantee (caução) from the landfill operator throughout the post-closure period against the cost of any remediation required.

The parameters monitored during post-closure include groundwater quality at defined monitoring wells, leachate quantity and quality, landfill gas composition and emission rates, topographic surveys to track settlement, and cap integrity monitoring by visual inspection and, in some licence conditions, electrical leak location surveys. Membriko provides technical support for all these monitoring activities and supplies documentation in the format required for APA annual reporting.

### EU Landfill Directive Revision — Directive 2018/850

The revision of the EU Landfill Directive (Directive 2018/850, part of the Circular Economy Package) imposed a requirement that member states reduce MSW landfilling to a maximum 10% of total municipal waste generated by 2035. For Portugal, which landfilled approximately 60% of MSW in 2010, this represents a structural transformation of the waste management system — and a directly corresponding acceleration of the landfill cell closure programme. Active cells are being closed progressively as recycling and recovery infrastructure is built out, creating a sustained pipeline of cap installation projects throughout the 2020s and 2030s that Membriko is positioned to support.

### PERSU 2030 and Funding Mechanisms

PERSU 2030 (Portugal's Plano Estratégico para os Resíduos Urbanos) sets the national implementation framework for achieving the 10% landfilling target by 2035. It identifies the closure of active landfill cells, the remediation of legacy sites, and the capping of closed cells as priority investment categories.

Funding for landfill closure works is available through several mechanisms relevant to Portuguese waste management operators. The PRR (Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência — Portugal's national Recovery and Resilience Plan) includes environmental remediation and waste infrastructure investment as qualifying expenditure categories. Membriko can assist operators in preparing the technical documentation that supports PRR funding applications for cap installation projects, including specification compliance statements, scope of works descriptions, and technical justification for EPDM over alternative materials.

## Section 10: Post-Closure Monitoring and Maintenance of the Cap System

The installation of a landfill final cap is not the end of the engineering obligation — it is the beginning of a 30-year monitored service period during which the cap must continuously demonstrate its hydraulic integrity. Operators who commission a cap installation without thinking through the monitoring and maintenance programme are not completing the project; they are creating a future liability.

Membriko designs cap installations with post-closure monitoring in mind from the outset, and offers structured post-closure support services that can be contracted at the time of cap installation — providing the operator with a single accountable technical partner throughout the regulatory monitoring period.

### Annual Visual Inspection

Each year during the post-closure period, Membriko recommends a visual inspection of all accessible cap surfaces: the crest, the side slopes, the anchor trench areas, and any exposed membrane sections in areas of incomplete vegetation cover. The inspection identifies areas of vegetation loss (which expose the EPDM to UV), signs of erosion in the cover soil (which can expose the drainage geocomposite), areas of localised settlement that have created surface depressions or tension ridges in the cap, and any mechanical damage from access vehicles or animal burrowing.

Membriko conducts annual cap inspections using UAV photogrammetry, comparing the digital terrain model from each survey against the previous year's model and the as-installed baseline. Changes in surface elevation of 10 cm or more are flagged for assessment against the differential settlement risk model for the site.

### Electrical Leak Location Surveys

Electrical leak location (ELL) technology — also known as continuous leak path (CLP) detection — can identify breaches in geomembranes beneath cover soil layers without excavation. An electrical potential is applied across the geomembrane, and the resulting surface potential field is mapped on a grid above the cap. Any hydraulic breach in the membrane creates a detectable anomaly in the surface potential field, locatable to within a few decimetres.

Membriko recommends ELL surveys at five-year intervals during the post-closure monitoring period, or after any anomalous settlement event identified by the annual topographic survey. An ELL survey on a two-to-five hectare cap can typically be completed in one to two days and produces a complete spatial map of cap integrity at that point in time. Where breaches are identified, their location enables targeted excavation and repair rather than speculative investigation across the whole cap area.

### Settlement Monitoring

The topographic UAV survey conducted annually provides a settlement monitoring record that identifies areas of active differential settlement. Where the rate of settlement in any area indicates that cumulative strain demands on the EPDM are approaching a threshold requiring assessment, Membriko conducts a site-specific analysis of whether the current membrane thickness and anchor trench configuration remain adequate or whether supplementary protection measures are needed.

### Leachate Quantity Monitoring

The volume of leachate collected from a landfill's drainage system is an indirect indicator of cap performance: a sustained increase in leachate generation during a dry period (when surface runoff cannot explain the increase) may indicate that infiltration through the cap has increased. Membriko advises operators on interpreting leachate monitoring data in the context of cap integrity and distinguishing cap-related infiltration from other sources such as groundwater intrusion.

### Repair Procedures

If inspection or ELL survey identifies a breach in the Membriko EPDM cap, the repair procedure is straightforward and does not require replacement of large panel areas:

1. The cover soil and drainage layer above the affected area are carefully excavated and set aside
2. The EPDM surface in the breach area is cleaned, dried, and the breach is precisely located
3. An EPDM patch of the same thickness and formulation is applied using QuickPrime Plus primer and QuickSeam tape, extending a minimum of 150 mm beyond the breach in all directions
4. The repair seam is tested by peel strength sampling and, where accessible, by localised ELL
5. The drainage layer and cover soil are reinstated in layers, compacted to the design specification

A single isolated breach can typically be repaired within one to three working days including excavation and reinstatement. Membriko includes repair execution in its post-closure support contract offer.

## Section 11: Portugal's Landfill Infrastructure — LIPOR, Valorsul, and the SGRU Network

Portugal's 23 SGRU systems cover every municipality on the mainland, providing an integrated waste management framework that is administered by inter-municipal or regional bodies operating under framework agreements with the central government and APA. Membriko is familiar with this infrastructure in detail — the geography of the principal sites, the technical characteristics of the waste managed by each operator, and the regulatory timeline for cell closures.

### Northern Portugal

**LIPOR** (Serviço Intermunicipalizado de Gestão de Resíduos do Grande Porto) serves eight municipalities of the Porto metropolitan area and operates the Aterro Sanitário de Sermonde in Gondomar — one of the largest MSW disposal facilities in northern Portugal. Sermonde's older cells are at or approaching closure stage, and the combination of waste age, waste height, and high-rainfall Atlantic climate makes differential settlement accommodation and biogas collection integration particularly important in the cap system specification. LIPOR also operates a landfill gas-to-energy system, making cap integrity directly relevant to LFGE productivity.

**RESINORTE** serves 22 municipalities in the northern interior and operates the Aterro de Travassos. The inland location brings colder winter conditions — making EPDM's low-temperature flexibility relevant — and lower annual precipitation than coastal sites, though summer temperatures can be high.

**RESULIMA** covers the Lima, Cávado, and Ave watershed municipalities, serving one of the most densely populated regions outside the two metropolitan areas.

### Lisbon Metropolitan Area and Centre

**Valorsul** serves 12 municipalities north of Lisbon and operates the Aterro Sanitário de São João da Talha in Loures and the Aterro de Hulição in Arruda dos Vinhos. São João da Talha is among the largest MSW landfill facilities in Portugal and includes an active LFGE system — directly illustrating the economic value of a high-integrity EPDM cap for maximising gas capture efficiency. As Valorsul's cells progress through the closure sequence, the cap installation programme at this site will be substantial in scale and technical complexity.

**AMARSUL** (Valorização e Tratamento de Resíduos Sólidos, SA) serves municipalities south of the River Tagus and operates the Aterro de Setúbal and the Aterro de Alcácer do Sal. The Alentejo location of the Alcácer site means hot, dry summers — making GCL desiccation a genuine concern and EPDM's desiccation immunity directly relevant to the cap specification.

### Southern Portugal

**ALGAR** (Valorização e Tratamento de Resíduos Sólidos) serves the 16 municipalities of the Algarve region and operates the Aterro Sanitário da Goldra (Loulé) and the Aterro de Portimão. The Algarve has the highest UV irradiance in Portugal — peak UV index of 11 in July — and long, hot, dry summers with limited and irregular precipitation. These climatic conditions make UV stability and desiccation resistance the primary selection criteria for cap geomembrane materials. Membriko EPDM's UV stability at 10,000-hour xenon arc testing without degradation is specifically relevant to Algarve cap installations.

**GESAMB** serves the Guadiana and Alentejo region, covering municipalities in one of Portugal's least densely populated but most arid areas.

### The Closure Pipeline

The combination of cells reaching design capacity, PERSU 2030 landfill reduction targets driving accelerated closure, and EU Directive 2018/850's 10% landfilling target by 2035 creates a sustained and substantial pipeline of final cap installation projects across Portugal throughout the 2020s and into the 2030s. Estimates suggest 150 to 200 landfill cells at Portuguese SGRU facilities will require final cap systems during this period. Membriko, based in Pombal with national coverage and the technical capability for large-scale geomembrane projects in complex terrain, is positioned to support operators across this entire pipeline.

## Section 12: Post-Closure Management — The 30-Year Legal Obligation

The 30-year post-closure monitoring period imposed by DL 183/2009 is not merely an environmental safeguard — it is a financial and operational obligation that the landfill operator must plan for from the moment of cap installation. APA retains a financial guarantee from the operator throughout this period, which can be called upon if monitoring data reveals cap failure or environmental impact that the operator fails to remediate.

### The Economic Case for EPDM Over the 30-Year Period

The choice of cap geomembrane affects the 30-year cost model significantly. An EPDM cap — with 100+ year projected service life under the topsoil, no susceptibility to ESC, and a track record of 30+ years of monitoring in European landfill cap applications without hydraulic compromise — is unlikely to require geomembrane replacement within the mandatory monitoring period. The cost model over 30 years therefore includes installation, routine monitoring, and occasional minor repairs.

An HDPE cap that develops ESC-related failures in years 15 to 25 — the period of highest risk, when residual stress in the polymer from installation has been joined by surface embrittlement from long-term leachate exposure — requires excavation of the cover soil, replacement or repair of the geomembrane, and reinstatement of all cap layers. On a multi-hectare cap, this remediation cost is substantial — potentially exceeding the original cap installation cost. The financial guarantee held by APA provides the operator with no comfort if it does not cover the actual remediation cost.

Membriko is explicit about this comparison with procurement officers because it changes the economic framing of the material choice. The higher unit cost per square metre of EPDM relative to a thinner HDPE geomembrane is more than offset by the reduced probability of major remediation within the 30-year obligation period.

### Membriko's Post-Closure Support Contract

Membriko offers a structured post-closure technical support agreement that can be executed simultaneously with the cap installation contract. The agreement covers:

- Annual UAV topographic survey and visual inspection, with written report to operator
- Five-yearly ELL survey and cap integrity assessment
- Reactive repair services following inspection findings, with a guaranteed response time
- Annual reporting documentation support for APA submissions
- Settlement monitoring data interpretation and geomembrane strain analysis

The terms of the post-closure support agreement are fixed at the time of cap installation — giving the operator cost certainty for the monitoring obligation and eliminating the risk of not being able to find a contractor familiar with the installation when remediation is needed years later.

### The Membriko Installation Warranty

Membriko issues a 20-year installation warranty on landfill cap geomembrane works covering material defects and workmanship failures. This warranty covers the first two-thirds of the mandatory post-closure monitoring period — the period during which installation-related defects are most likely to manifest. The underlying EPDM product warranty from the manufacturer complements the Membriko installation warranty, providing layered coverage for the operator's obligations.

## Section 13: Methane Capture — The Environmental and Commercial Argument

The management of methane generated by decomposing municipal solid waste is simultaneously one of the most significant environmental challenges in the waste sector and one of the most commercially interesting opportunities for landfill operators. Membriko EPDM caps directly influence both the environmental performance and the commercial outcome of landfill gas management.

### The Climate Significance of Landfill Methane

Methane's global warming potential over a 20-year horizon is 84 times that of carbon dioxide — making it one of the most potent greenhouse gases in terms of near-term climate impact. MSW landfills are significant methane sources: the biological decomposition of organic waste (food waste, paper, garden waste) generates methane and carbon dioxide in roughly equal proportions in an anaerobic environment. European landfill gas emission inventories consistently identify uncontrolled landfill methane as a major contributor to national greenhouse gas totals in the waste sector.

Portugal's waste sector greenhouse gas inventory reflects this: landfill gas emissions have historically accounted for a substantial proportion of total waste sector methane. As older landfill cells are closed and new waste diversion infrastructure reduces the landfilling of organic material, the gas generation rate from active landfills will decline over time — but the existing waste mass in closed cells will continue to generate methane for decades.

### How Cap Integrity Affects Gas Management Performance

A cap geomembrane serves two opposing functions in gas management: it prevents atmospheric oxygen from entering the waste mass from above, and it prevents methane from escaping to the atmosphere from below.

The prevention of oxygen ingress is important because methanogenic bacteria — the archaea responsible for methane production — are obligate anaerobes. Any oxygen that enters the waste mass through a cap breach suppresses methane production in the surrounding zone, reducing gas yield. A tightly sealed Membriko EPDM cap maintains anaerobic conditions throughout the waste mass, maximising the volume of methane available for capture.

The prevention of methane escape to atmosphere outside the active extraction system is the other half of the equation. Gas that escapes through cap breaches is not captured — it is lost to atmosphere as an uncontrolled greenhouse gas emission, and it reduces the gas collection efficiency metric that APA monitoring tracks. A Membriko EPDM cap with zero hydraulic breaches routes all gas produced by the waste mass through the drainage layer to the extraction system — maximising collection efficiency and minimising fugitive emissions.

### Economic Value of High Capture Efficiency

At Portuguese landfills with LFGE systems — where collected methane is combusted in gas engines to generate electricity — the quantity of gas captured directly determines the electricity output and the revenue generated. Under RENO feed-in tariff arrangements applicable to landfill gas-to-energy plants, each additional megawatt-hour of electricity generated from captured methane has a defined economic value. A Membriko EPDM cap that maintains zero-breach performance maximises this revenue stream throughout the gas production life of the closed cell.

### Carbon Accounting and Emerging Carbon Markets

As voluntary carbon markets mature and the potential extension of the EU Emissions Trading System to the waste sector is discussed, the quantified capture of methane from landfill gas — documented by monitoring data attributable to cap integrity — may generate carbon credits with tangible economic value. Membriko provides installation certification and monitoring documentation that supports methane capture claims under recognised carbon accounting protocols. A cap installation supported by Membriko's quality assurance records and post-closure monitoring data provides the evidential foundation for carbon credit claims that a cap without this documentation cannot support.

## Section 14: Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between EPDM membrane and HDPE geomembrane for landfill sealing?**

Both are hydraulic barriers that can satisfy the requirements of DL 183/2009 Annex I for landfill cap systems. The differences that matter for cap applications are as follows. EPDM has an elongation at break of 300% to 450% and is not susceptible to environmental stress cracking — the slow-crack growth mechanism that is the dominant long-term failure mode in HDPE cap geomembranes exposed to leachate surfactants. EPDM's thermal expansion coefficient is approximately one-third that of HDPE, which means significantly less thermal movement and fewer surface wrinkles on large-area cap installations — wrinkles that create drainage interference and cyclical stress fatigue. EPDM remains fully flexible at temperatures down to -60°C, whereas HDPE begins to stiffen below approximately 10°C, increasing brittleness risk at weld seams during cold-weather installation or thermal cycling. For base liner applications under compressive overburden, HDPE at 2.0 mm or above is appropriate. For cap applications in tension, subject to differential settlement, UV exposure, and thermal cycling, Membriko specifies EPDM as the superior technical choice.

**Does EPDM geomembrane satisfy the requirements of Decreto-Lei 183/2009 for landfill sealing?**

Yes. EPDM geomembrane at 1.14 mm to 1.52 mm thickness, with hydraulic conductivity far below the threshold required by DL 183/2009 Annex I, satisfies the geomembrane requirements for both non-hazardous and hazardous waste landfills. For hazardous waste sites, Membriko specifies 2.0 mm EPDM where the licence conditions require the equivalent of a 2.0 mm HDPE geomembrane. Membriko provides the complete certification documentation package — CE conformity declarations, independent EN test reports, EN 13361 and EN 13492 compliance statements — as a standard deliverable for every landfill cap project, in the format required for APA submission.

**How does EPDM accommodate the differential settlement of a landfill?**

EPDM's elongation at break of 300% to 450% means that it can absorb tensile strains far in excess of those generated by typical differential settlement at Portuguese MSW landfills. A representative example: one metre of differential settlement across a ten-metre span generates approximately 10% tensile strain in the cap geomembrane. Against EPDM's 400% elongation capacity, the safety factor at this strain demand is 40. The membrane absorbs the strain elastically, without yielding, without stress cracking, and without loss of hydraulic integrity. As differential settlement stabilises over subsequent years, the EPDM recovers elastically towards its initial geometry. This behaviour is qualitatively and quantitatively different from HDPE, which yields at 12% to 18% elongation and can develop stress cracking under sustained multi-directional load.

**How is biogas collection integrated with the EPDM cap membrane?**

Gas collection pipes from the drainage layer below the EPDM are brought through the membrane at purpose-designed penetration points. Membriko details each penetration with a formed EPDM pipe boot bonded to the membrane using QuickSeam adhesive system, secured with a stainless steel compression flange bolted to a formed EPDM collar. The assembly creates a hermetic seal between the membrane and the gas extraction riser that is individually tested by electrical leak location before the drainage layer and cover soil are placed above. The gas drainage layer below the EPDM acts as a plenum — gas migrates horizontally to collection risers at low pressure without building uplift force on the membrane. Where active extraction is used, the system maintains sub-atmospheric conditions below the EPDM, eliminating uplift risk entirely.

**Does EPDM membrane resist root penetration from landfill cover vegetation?**

Yes. EPDM geomembrane has demonstrated root resistance in demanding green roof applications per the FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau) root resistance test and EN 13948, where root penetration pressure from established shrubs, trees, and herbaceous vegetation is sustained for decades without membrane failure. The same intrinsic root resistance applies to the meadow, grassland, and woodland vegetation communities established on landfill cover systems. Over more than 30 years of monitored EPDM performance in covered applications subject to root pressure, no root penetration failure has been documented in correctly installed geomembrane. Membriko specifies cover soil depths and vegetation species appropriate to each cap site to minimise the root penetration pressure on the EPDM below.

**What is the projected service life of an EPDM membrane in a landfill cap?**

For EPDM geomembrane protected from UV by the overlying topsoil and drainage layers — the condition for the vast majority of a landfill cap's area — Arrhenius thermal ageing studies and long-term monitoring data from ERA (European EPDM manufacturers' association) and SKZ (Süddeutsches Kunststoff-Zentrum) support a projected service life of 100+ years. This exceeds the 30-year minimum post-closure monitoring period required by DL 183/2009 by a factor greater than three. For exposed EPDM in areas where vegetation cover is incomplete — crest edges, anchor trench areas — accelerated UV weathering tests to ASTM G154 and published field performance data support a projected service life of 50+ years. Membriko cap installations designed and installed today should remain hydraulically intact throughout and well beyond the mandatory monitoring period.

**How long does it take to install an EPDM cap on a large Portuguese landfill cell?**

A Membriko installation crew working on a landfill cap project achieves approximately 2,000 to 4,000 square metres of installed and seamed membrane per day, depending on site complexity, the number of field seams in the panel layout, the number of gas collection pipe penetrations requiring detailing, and the accessibility of the terrain. A typical Portuguese aterro cell of two to five hectares requires five to twenty-five working days for membrane installation, plus mobilisation, pre-installation survey and preparation, and post-installation testing. Membriko provides a detailed project programme with the technical proposal, identifying the critical path activities and the interface with other cap layer contractors.

**Does Membriko provide technical support during the post-closure monitoring period?**

Yes. Membriko offers post-closure technical support services that can be contracted at the time of cap installation. The support package includes annual UAV topographic and visual inspection surveys with written reports to the operator and APA, five-yearly electrical leak location (ELL) surveys of the complete cap area, targeted membrane repair services following inspection findings, interpretation of leachate monitoring data in the context of cap integrity, and preparation of technical documentation for APA annual reporting submissions. By establishing a post-closure support agreement at the point of cap installation, the landfill operator secures a single technical partner with full knowledge of the installation — the panel layout, seam locations, penetration details, and as-installed baseline conditions — who can provide monitoring, diagnosis, and repair with a continuity of technical knowledge that ad hoc contractors cannot replicate.
