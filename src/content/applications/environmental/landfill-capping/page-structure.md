# Landfill Capping — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Landfill capping is a specialised, high-value application that positions Membriko firmly in the
environmental engineering sector alongside the more visible roofing and water containment markets.
The buyers for this application are not homeowners or hotel managers — they are municipal engineers,
waste management company technical directors, environmental consultants, and procurement officers
at SGRU (Sistemas de Gestão de Resíduos Urbanos) entities. The content must speak their language:
regulatory compliance, long-term performance guarantees, settlement accommodation, post-closure
monitoring, and technical specifications that match tender requirements.

The persuasion architecture differs significantly from residential applications. There is no
emotional hook — the reader is not replacing a failing pool liner in their Alentejo quinta.
Instead, the content must establish technical credibility above all else, demonstrate familiarity
with the specific Portuguese regulatory framework (DL 183/2009, APA oversight, PERSU targets),
name the relevant operators (LIPOR, Valorsul, ALGAR, RESINORTE), and make a clear and
documented case for EPDM over the default specification (HDPE geomembrane) and over GCL.

The secondary audience is environmental consultants preparing technical studies for landfill
closure projects. These consultants are the specification-writers — they recommend the
geomembrane system. Content that addresses their technical questions directly — settlement
accommodation, gas integration, root resistance, long-term stability — can influence the
specification before it reaches the procurement stage.

The FAQs should capture search terms used by engineers and procurement officers: "geomembrana
aterro sanitário", "membrana EPDM aterro", "selagem aterro DL 183/2009", "geomembrana HDPE vs
EPDM aterro".

## Section 1: Introduction — Portuguese Landfill Management and the Capping Challenge

**Purpose:** Establish the market context, demonstrate knowledge of the sector, and open with
the fundamental engineering challenge of landfill capping.

**Content:**
- Portugal's waste management transformation since EU accession: the 23 SGRU systems, the
  principal operators (LIPOR, Valorsul, ALGAR, AMARSUL, RESINORTE, RESULIMA, GESAMB)
- The closure pipeline: landfills built in the 1990s and 2000s are reaching end-of-life as
  PERSU 2030 targets drive waste diversion from landfill; accelerating demand for final cap
  systems throughout the 2020s-2030s
- The engineering challenge: the cap must seal the waste, control gas, support vegetation,
  and remain intact under decades of differential settlement — a combination of requirements
  that no rigid or semi-rigid material can satisfy
- Membriko's answer: EPDM geomembrane from Pombal, specified and installed for final cap
  systems that comply with DL 183/2009 and meet the performance requirements of post-closure
  monitoring for 30+ years
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Proposta Técnica" / "Request Technical Proposal"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Landfill Caps

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — the property-by-property case for EPDM over alternatives,
specifically framed around the challenges of cap applications rather than base liner service.

**Content:**
- The five critical properties for cap geomembranes: elongation (settlement accommodation),
  UV stability (long-term exposed surface durability), chemical resistance (biogas and leachate),
  root resistance (vegetation cover), and low-temperature flexibility (winter installation)
- EPDM advantage on each property versus HDPE and GCL
- Physical data table:
  | Property | EPDM Cap Grade | Test Method |
  |---|---|---|
  | Thickness | 1.5 mm / 2.0 mm | EN 1849-2 |
  | Elongation at break | ≥ 300% (typically 400%+) | EN 12311-2 |
  | Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
  | UV resistance (xenon arc) | No cracking at 10,000 hours | ASTM G154 |
  | Low-temperature flexibility | Pass at -40°C | EN 495-5 |
  | Root resistance | Pass | FLL / EN 13948 |
  | Methane permeability | < 3 × 10⁻¹² m²·s⁻¹·Pa⁻¹ | ASTM D1434 |
  | Hydrostatic watertightness | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 |
  | Dimensional stability | < 1% | EN 1107-2 |
  | Projected service life (covered) | 100+ years | ERA/SKZ studies |

## Section 3: Cap System Layers — Complete Stack

**Purpose:** Educate the reader on the full cap system, positioning EPDM within the multi-layer
system required by DL 183/2009.

**Content:** Layer-by-layer description with the EPDM geomembrane in its correct position.

From bottom (waste) to top (atmosphere):
1. **Prepared waste surface / final waste layer:** compacted and graded to design slope
2. **Gas collection and drainage layer:** 0.3-0.5 m aggregate or geocomposite drainage mat;
   gas collection pipes at regular spacing; connected to active extraction system
3. **Mineral sealing layer:** 0.5 m compacted clay or equivalent (k ≤ 10⁻⁹ m/s per DL 183/2009
   Annex I); protects EPDM from below; covered above by EPDM which protects mineral layer
   from desiccation cracking
4. **EPDM geomembrane (Membriko):** 1.5-2.0 mm; the primary hydraulic barrier; installed
   above mineral layer; provides redundant protection against desiccation of mineral layer;
   accommodates differential settlement that would crack mineral layer alone
5. **Drainage/protection geocomposite or granular drainage layer:** immediately above EPDM;
   0.3 m aggregate or geocomposite drainage mat; collects and diverts precipitation; protects
   EPDM from puncture by topsoil stone content
6. **Restoration layer (topsoil):** 0.6-1.0 m for grassland; 1.0-1.5 m for woodland; provides
   thermal protection for EPDM; supports vegetation; final visual integration of closed landfill

Visual: cross-section diagram concept showing all layers with dimensions and annotations.

## Section 4: Gas Collection Integration

**Purpose:** Address the specific technical challenge of integrating gas collection infrastructure
with the cap geomembrane — a topic that separates competent landfill capping contractors from
general waterproofing installers.

**Content:**
- Why gas management is inseparable from cap design: methane is a greenhouse gas (GWP₂₀ = 84);
  DL 183/2009 requires gas collection; an intact cap maximises gas collection efficiency and
  therefore maximises energy recovery from landfill gas-to-energy systems
- How the EPDM cap interfaces with gas collection: the gas drainage layer below the EPDM acts
  as a plenum; gas migrates horizontally to vertical extraction risers that penetrate the EPDM
  through purpose-built pipe boot penetrations
- Passive vs active gas collection: active extraction systems maintain sub-atmospheric pressure
  below the cap, preventing uplift; passive systems with cap vents at defined intervals (every
  0.25-1.0 ha) for lower-productivity landfills
- Penetration detailing: EPDM pipe boots, compression flanges, and QA testing at each penetration
- Uplift risk management: design of gas drainage layer spacing and extraction system capacity
  to prevent gas pressure buildup below the EPDM membrane

---

## Section 5: Installation on Irregular Terrain

**Purpose:** Address the installation challenge specific to landfill caps — irregular, sloping
waste surfaces that are unlike any other geomembrane application.

**Content:**
- The landfill surface challenge: non-uniform settlement creates surface irregularities of
  0.5-2.0 m across the cap area; slopes of 3-20% are typical; anchor trenches at the perimeter
  and at intermediate terraces create mechanical stress concentration points
- EPDM advantage in irregular terrain: large-format panels (widths to 15.25 m) dramatically
  reduce the number of field seams; the membrane's flexibility allows conformance to undulations
  without requiring the panel heating that HDPE requires to relax wrinkles
- Slope stability: geomembrane on slopes is subject to gravitational loads; EPDM's coefficient
  of friction with geotextiles and granular materials exceeds that of smooth HDPE; for slopes
  > 1:3 (18°), textured EPDM or a friction-enhancing geocomposite is specified
- Anchor trench design: perimeter anchor trenches in compacted clay or concrete; the EPDM panel
  is laid into the trench and backfilled; anchor trench depth and geometry is designed to
  accommodate the maximum calculated thermal and settlement movement
- Field seaming: EPDM panels are seamed in the field using Firestone QuickSeam tape and primer;
  all field seams are documented with GPS coordinates, photographs, and peel strength test results
- Membrane coverage sequence: installation proceeds up-slope; panels are overlapped downslope
  to prevent water infiltration at seams during construction; final seaming is completed once
  all panels are positioned

---

## Section 6: Settlement Accommodation — EPDM Flexibility as the Design Solution

**Purpose:** This is the central technical argument for EPDM over HDPE and GCL for cap
applications — make it with data and mechanical clarity.

**Content:**
- The scale of settlement in MSW landfills: 20-40% of initial waste height; for a 25 m waste
  body, 5-10 m total settlement over 30 years; differential settlement of 1-3 m across distances
  of 10-20 m is not exceptional at Portuguese aterros sanitários
- How EPDM responds to settlement: tensile strain is distributed across the membrane panel;
  with 400% elongation capacity, even severe local differential settlement (1 m across 10 m
  span = 10% tensile strain) is absorbed without approaching failure limits; elastic recovery
  ensures no permanent deformation once settlement stabilises
- How HDPE responds to settlement: HDPE yields at approximately 12-18% elongation (yield
  stress); beyond yield, HDPE deforms plastically and does not recover; at anchor trenches,
  where strain is concentrated, HDPE panels can develop tears or stress cracking failures
- How GCL responds to settlement: GCL has negligible tensile capacity; moderate differential
  settlement causes tensile failure and hydraulic breaching of the GCL layer
- Case reference data: measured EPDM cap performance on large European landfills shows no
  hydraulic compromise after 20-30 years of differential settlement up to 3 m across anchor spans
- Calculation example: strain demand at a representative anchor trench vs EPDM capacity margin

## Section 7: EPDM vs HDPE and GCL for Landfill Capping

**Purpose:** Proactive comparison that addresses the most likely specification alternatives.
Framed as objective technical analysis, not promotional.

**Content:** Comparison table with 8 rows.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE Geomembrane | GCL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | 300-450% | 300-600%* | < 10% |
| Stress cracking susceptibility | None | Present (ESC) | N/A |
| Thermal expansion | Low | High (3× EPDM) | N/A |
| UV stability (covered) | Excellent (100+ years) | Good (60-80 years est.) | Poor (bentonite shrinkage) |
| Settlement accommodation | Excellent | Moderate* | Poor |
| Desiccation risk | None | None | High |
| Root resistance | Excellent (FLL/EN 13948) | Good | Moderate |
| Field seam quality | Adhesive/tape — robust | Heat weld — skill-sensitive | Needle-punch — robust |

*HDPE elongation at break figures are achieved in unstressed laboratory specimens; real field
performance under sustained load and in the presence of surfactants is substantially lower
due to stress cracking.

Honest acknowledgement: HDPE at 2.0+ mm is a well-proven system for landfill base liners
where the geomembrane is under sustained compressive stress from overburden and where thermal
movement is constrained. For cap applications — where the geomembrane is in tension from
settlement, exposed to UV during construction and through vegetation gaps, and subject to
thermal cycling — EPDM's properties are specifically advantageous.

## Section 8: Environmental Regulations — DL 183/2009 and the EU Landfill Directive

**Purpose:** Demonstrate command of the Portuguese and EU regulatory framework — essential
for credibility with municipal engineers and procurement officers.

**Content:**
- Decreto-Lei n.º 183/2009: technical requirements for cap systems (Annex I); categories of
  landfill and corresponding cap requirements; post-closure monitoring obligations; APA oversight
- EU Council Directive 1999/31/EC (Landfill Directive): the source legislation; Annex I
  technical requirements for barrier systems; standard test methods for geomembrane acceptance
- Directive 2018/850: revision of the Landfill Directive; 10% maximum MSW landfilling by 2035;
  consequence for Portugal — accelerated closure programme, increased cap installation pipeline
- PERSU 2030: Portuguese strategic waste management plan; landfill reduction targets; funding
  mechanisms for closure works (POSEUR, PRR — Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência)
- APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente): the competent authority for landfill licensing and
  oversight; post-closure monitoring requirements; documentation that APA requires for cap
  system acceptance — which Membriko provides
- PRR funding context: Portugal's Recovery and Resilience Plan includes funding for environmental
  remediation and waste infrastructure; closure of legacy landfills is a qualifying expenditure;
  Membriko can assist with technical documentation for funding applications

## Section 10: Maintenance and Monitoring of the Cap System

**Purpose:** Address the post-closure management phase — an often underserved topic that is
critical to procurement officers responsible for 30-year monitoring obligations.

**Content:**
- The monitoring obligation: DL 183/2009 requires 30-year minimum post-closure monitoring
  after landfill closure; cap integrity is a key monitored parameter alongside groundwater,
  leachate, and landfill gas
- What EPDM cap monitoring involves:
  - Annual visual inspection of exposed cap areas (crest, slopes, anchor trenches)
  - Electrical leak location (ELL/CLP) survey at defined intervals — ELL can locate breaches
    in geomembranes beneath cover soil with millimetre precision; Membriko recommends ELL
    surveys every 5 years or following significant settlement events
  - Settlement topographic surveys (GPS/UAV) to identify areas of active differential settlement
    that may require cap repair
  - Leachate quantity monitoring as indirect hydraulic indicator of cap performance
  - Vegetation cover assessment — gaps in vegetation expose EPDM to UV; areas with persistent
    bare soil require re-seeding or supplementary geomembrane protection
- Repair procedures: EPDM cap panels can be repaired in situ; damaged areas are excavated,
  the membrane is cleaned, dried, and repaired with EPDM patch adhered with QuickSeam; the
  topsoil and drainage layer are then reinstated
- Long-term stability: covered EPDM (protected from UV by the topsoil layer) has a projected
  service life of 100+ years based on Arrhenius thermal ageing studies; Membriko caps installed
  today should perform without compromise throughout and beyond the 30-year post-closure
  monitoring period

## Section 11: Portuguese Landfill Infrastructure — LIPOR, Valorsul, and the SGRU Network

**Purpose:** Demonstrate sector-specific knowledge by naming the key operators and the scale
of the Portuguese landfill infrastructure programme.

**Content:**
- Overview of Portugal's 23 SGRU systems and their geographic coverage
- Principal operators and their landfill assets:
  - LIPOR (Porto metropolitan area): Sermonde; approaching or at closure stage for oldest cells
  - Valorsul (north Lisbon): São João da Talha; Hulição; among the largest MSW facilities
  - AMARSUL (south Tagus): Setúbal; Alcácer do Sal
  - ALGAR (Algarve): Goldra (Loulé); Portimão
  - RESINORTE (north): Travassos
  - RESULIMA, GERAMB, GESAMB, ECOÁGUA, and others
- The closure pipeline: estimated 150-200 cells at Portuguese landfills reaching closure stage
  between 2020 and 2035; driven by PERSU 2030 landfill reduction targets and cell capacity
  exhaustion
- Membriko's positioning: as a Portuguese EPDM installer based in Pombal, with coverage across
  the country and technical capability for large civil geomembrane projects

---

## Section 12: Post-Closure Management — The 30-Year Obligation

**Purpose:** Speak directly to the procurement officer's concern: what happens after installation,
who is responsible, and how does EPDM's performance support the post-closure management plan?

**Content:**
- The legal structure of post-closure management under DL 183/2009: the landfill operator
  remains responsible for monitoring and maintenance throughout the post-closure period (minimum
  30 years); APA holds a financial guarantee (caução) against post-closure obligations
- Financial planning for post-closure: the choice of cap system affects the 30-year cost model;
  an EPDM cap requiring no replacement within the regulatory oversight period is economically
  superior to an HDPE cap that may require remediation after stress cracking failures
- Membriko's post-closure support offer: technical inspection services, ELL surveys, repair
  execution, and documentation support for APA annual reporting throughout the monitoring period
- The 20-year Membriko installation warranty on cap geomembrane work: covers material and
  workmanship defects; complementary to the manufacturer's product warranty; provides insurance
  coverage for the most risk-intensive phase of post-closure management

---

## Section 13: Methane Capture — Environmental and Economic Case

**Purpose:** Address the environmental and commercial value of a high-integrity cap in the
context of landfill gas-to-energy programmes.

**Content:**
- Landfill gas composition: 45-60% CH₄; 35-50% CO₂; traces of H₂S, VOCs
- Climate impact: CH₄ global warming potential is 84× CO₂ over 20 years; uncontrolled methane
  emissions from landfills are a major contributor to Portugal's greenhouse gas inventory
- How cap integrity affects methane capture: a poorly sealed cap allows atmospheric oxygen to
  enter the waste mass (inhibiting anaerobic methane production) and allows methane to escape
  to atmosphere at points outside the collection system (reducing capture efficiency); a well-sealed
  EPDM cap maximises both methane production rate and capture efficiency
- Economic value of captured methane: Portuguese landfills with LFGE systems generate electricity
  from collected methane; revenue from LFGE (FIT tariffs under RENO regime) partially offsets
  post-closure management costs; maximising capture efficiency with an intact EPDM cap increases
  the economic return from gas management
- Carbon credit potential: under emerging voluntary carbon markets and potential EU ETS expansion
  to landfill gas, high capture rates attributable to cap integrity may generate carbon credits;
  a Membriko EPDM cap with documented performance data supports claims under carbon accounting
  frameworks

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture long-tail engineer and procurement search intent; reduce pre-tender queries.

1. **Qual a diferença entre membrana EPDM e geomembrana HDPE em selagem de aterros?**
   Both are hydraulic barriers that satisfy DL 183/2009 Annex I requirements. EPDM has higher
   elongation (400% vs HDPE's effective field elongation), does not suffer stress cracking, has
   lower thermal expansion (reducing wrinkle formation on large caps), and has superior UV
   stability for exposed periods during construction or in areas of sparse vegetation cover.
   HDPE at 2.0+ mm is appropriate for base liner applications; EPDM is specifically advantageous
   for cap applications where settlement accommodation and thermal movement are the primary
   design challenges.

2. **O EPDM satisfaz os requisitos do Decreto-Lei 183/2009 para selagem de aterros?**
   Yes. EPDM geomembrane at 1.5-2.0 mm, with hydraulic conductivity far below the threshold
   required by DL 183/2009 Annex I, satisfies the geomembrane requirements for both non-hazardous
   and hazardous waste landfills. Membriko provides full product certification documentation
   for APA submission as part of every landfill cap project.

3. **Como é que o EPDM acomoda os assentamentos diferenciais do aterro?**
   EPDM's elongation at break of 300-450% means it can accommodate tensile strains far greater
   than those generated by typical differential settlement at Portuguese MSW landfills. A 1 m
   differential settlement across a 10 m span generates approximately 10% tensile strain — a
   fraction of EPDM's capacity. The membrane absorbs this strain elastically, without yielding
   or developing stress cracking, and recovers its form as settlement stabilises.

4. **Como é que a colecta de biogás é integrada com a membrana de selagem EPDM?**
   Gas collection pipes from the drainage layer below the EPDM are brought through the membrane
   at specifically designed penetration points using EPDM pipe boots and mechanical compression
   flanges. Each penetration is seal-tested and documented. The gas drainage layer acts as a
   plenum below the EPDM, allowing gas to migrate horizontally to collection risers. Active
   extraction systems maintain sub-atmospheric conditions below the membrane, preventing uplift.

5. **A membrana EPDM resiste a raízes de vegetação na cobertura do aterro?**
   Yes. EPDM geomembrane has demonstrated root resistance in green roof applications per the
   FLL root resistance test and EN 13948, where root penetration pressures from established
   vegetation are sustained for decades. The same resistance applies to the meadow, grassland,
   and woodland vegetation planted on landfill cover systems. In 30+ years of covered service,
   no root penetration failure has been documented in properly installed EPDM geomembrane.

6. **Qual é o período de vida útil projectado para a membrana EPDM numa cobertura de aterro?**
   For covered EPDM (protected from UV by the topsoil layer above), Arrhenius thermal ageing
   studies and long-term site monitoring data support a projected service life of 100+ years.
   This exceeds the 30-year minimum post-closure monitoring period required by DL 183/2009 with
   a substantial margin. Exposed EPDM (in areas of sparse vegetation) has a demonstrated service
   life of 50+ years based on accelerated UV weathering tests and field performance data.

7. **Quanto tempo demora a instalação de uma cobertura EPDM num aterro de grande dimensão?**
   Installation rate for a skilled Membriko crew on a landfill cap project is approximately
   2,000-4,000 m² per day depending on terrain complexity, number of field seams, and gas
   penetration points. A typical Portuguese aterro cell of 2-5 hectares requires 5-25 working
   days for membrane installation, plus mobilisation, preparation, and testing time. Membriko
   provides a detailed project schedule as part of the technical proposal.

8. **A Membriko presta assistência técnica durante o período de pós-encerramento do aterro?**
   Yes. Membriko offers post-closure technical support services including periodic visual
   inspections, electrical leak location (ELL) surveys, targeted membrane repairs, and technical
   documentation for APA annual reporting. The terms of post-closure support can be established
   in a maintenance contract at the time of cap installation — providing the landfill operator
   with a single accountable technical partner throughout the 30-year monitoring obligation.
