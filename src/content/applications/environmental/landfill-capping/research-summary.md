# Landfill Capping — EPDM Research Summary

## The Engineering Challenge of Landfill Caps

Landfill capping is one of the most demanding geosynthetic applications in civil and environmental
engineering. A final cap system must perform a set of functions simultaneously, over a time horizon
measured in decades to centuries, on a substrate that continues to move, settle, and generate
gas long after active waste deposition has ended. The cap must:

- Prevent surface water from infiltrating the waste mass (hydraulic barrier)
- Collect and divert precipitation away from the waste body
- Control and channel landfill gas (primarily methane and carbon dioxide) from below the cap
  to collection points
- Support revegetation to integrate the site into the landscape and prevent erosion
- Accommodate differential settlement without loss of integrity — often the most severe design
  challenge on large landfills
- Maintain integrity over a post-closure management period typically defined at 30 years minimum
  by European regulation, but in practice extending indefinitely for hazardous waste sites

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) geomembrane is increasingly specified for landfill cap
systems because its combination of extraordinary flexibility, chemical resistance, resistance to
biological attack, and long-term stability under UV exposure and weathering uniquely addresses
the challenges that rigid or semi-rigid liner materials cannot.

## Portuguese Landfill Infrastructure Context

Portugal has undergone substantial transformation of its solid waste management infrastructure
since joining the European Community. The landmark legislation is Decreto-Lei n.º 183/2009,
which transposed EU Council Directive 1999/31/EC (the Landfill Directive) into Portuguese law
and established the framework for landfill siting, construction, operation, closure, and
post-closure management. This decree, subsequently amended, defines three categories of landfill:

- **Aterros para resíduos inertes (inert waste landfills):** receive construction and demolition
  waste, excavation spoil, and other chemically stable materials; lowest regulatory requirements
- **Aterros para resíduos não perigosos (non-hazardous waste landfills):** the principal category
  for municipal solid waste (MSW); most of Portugal's active and closed landfills fall in this class
- **Aterros para resíduos perigosos (hazardous waste landfills):** industrial, chemical and special
  waste; highest regulatory requirements; geomembrane barriers mandatory in base and cap systems

Portugal manages municipal solid waste through a network of 23 inter-municipal waste management
systems (SGRU — Sistemas de Gestão de Resíduos Urbanos) established under the PERSU strategy
documents. The principal operators include:

- **LIPOR (Serviço Intermunicipalizado de Gestão de Resíduos do Grande Porto):** manages waste
  for 8 municipalities of the Porto metropolitan area; operates Aterro Sanitário de Sermonde
  (Gondomar) among other facilities
- **Valorsul:** serves the northern area of metropolitan Lisbon (12 municipalities); operates
  the Aterro Sanitário de São João da Talha (Loures) and the Aterro de Hulição (Arruda dos Vinhos)
- **AMARSUL:** serves municipalities south of the Tagus; operates Aterro de Setúbal and Aterro
  de Alcácer do Sal
- **RESINORTE:** serves 22 municipalities in the north; operates Aterro de Travassos
- **RESULIMA:** serves the Lima, Cávado and Ave watershed municipalities
- **ALGAR (Valorização e Tratamento de Resíduos Sólidos):** serves the Algarve; operates
  Aterro Sanitário da Goldra (Loulé) and Aterro de Portimão
- **GESAMB:** serves the Guadiana and Alentejo region

Many of these facilities were constructed in the 1990s and 2000s during the period of rapid
infrastructure investment following EU accession. The oldest cells at these sites are now
reaching or have reached closure stage — the phase at which the final cap system is installed.
The pipeline of landfill capping projects in Portugal will remain active throughout the 2020s
and 2030s as cells reach capacity and are closed progressively.

## EPDM Geomembrane Properties for Landfill Capping

### Key Physical Requirements

Landfill cap geomembranes must meet requirements that differ significantly from those for
base liner applications. Where base liners are primarily under compressive stress from overburden
and require resistance to leachate (highly aggressive liquid), cap geomembranes are primarily
under tensile and flexural stress from differential settlement, thermal cycling, and wind uplift,
and must resist the aggressive environment from above (UV, precipitation, plant root penetration)
as well as biogas from below.

Critical properties for cap applications:

**Elongation at break:** The single most important property for landfill cap geomembranes.
Differential settlement in municipal solid waste landfills can be extreme: total settlement of
20-40% of waste mass height is common for MSW, with differential settlement between adjacent
areas creating strain demands on the cap membrane. EPDM with elongation at break of 300-450%
is uniquely positioned to accommodate these strains without tearing. HDPE geomembrane (elongation
at break 300-600% in unreinforced form, but heavily notch-sensitive and susceptible to stress
cracking) performs less well than its elongation figure suggests under the cyclic and sustained
multi-directional stress conditions of a settling landfill. GCL (geosynthetic clay liner) has
minimal tensile capacity and fails in tension under significant differential settlement.

**Resistance to UV and weathering:** Cap geomembranes, unlike base liners, are exposed to UV
radiation at the surface where vegetation has not yet established, and through any gaps in the
vegetation cover throughout the life of the site. EPDM's saturated polymer backbone, combined
with carbon black loading of 30-50 phr, provides intrinsic UV stability that does not degrade
over time. Published ASTM G154 weathering test data on cap-grade EPDM show:
- Tensile strength retention > 90% after 10,000 hours xenon arc irradiation
- Elongation retention > 85% after equivalent exposure
- No surface cracking, checking or chalking

**Resistance to biogas:** Landfill gas from MSW landfills is typically 45-60% methane (CH₄),
35-50% carbon dioxide (CO₂), with trace components including hydrogen sulphide (H₂S), volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrogen (H₂). EPDM has demonstrated excellent resistance to all
components of typical landfill gas in standard immersion and permeation testing. The permeability
of EPDM to methane is very low (comparable to HDPE at equivalent thickness), which is important
because landfill gas must be actively controlled and not allowed to migrate horizontally below
the cap to unintended emission points.

**Low-temperature flexibility:** Cap geomembranes in northern Portugal (Trás-os-Montes, Serra
da Estrela area, northern Minho) must remain flexible at temperatures approaching 0°C to -5°C.
EPDM has a glass transition temperature of -60°C to -50°C, making it fully flexible at all
Portuguese outdoor conditions. HDPE cap sheets can become stiff at temperatures below 10°C,
increasing the risk of cracking during installation or during cold-weather temperature cycling.

**Resistance to root penetration:** The vegetated soil layer above the cap geomembrane presents
a root penetration risk. EPDM has demonstrated resistance to root penetration in the context of
green roofs (FLL root resistance test, EN 13948), where root pressure from established plant
systems is sustained over decades. The same resistance applies to the grass, meadow and woodland
vegetation established on landfill cap cover systems.

**Puncture resistance:** The coarse materials in gas drainage layers above the geomembrane and
the variable quality of the clay/soil substrate below present puncture risks during installation
and from point loads. Cap-grade EPDM at 1.5-2.0 mm thickness provides adequate puncture
resistance for most cap configurations; where the aggregate drainage layer is coarse, a
geotextile protection layer is installed immediately above and below the EPDM.

## Cap System Layers — Technical Configuration

A compliant final cap system for a non-hazardous MSW landfill under DL 183/2009 typically
comprises the following layers, from bottom (waste) to top (atmosphere):

1. **Gas collection and drainage layer:** typically a coarse granular material (20-40 mm
   aggregate) or geocomposite drainage mat, installed directly on the compacted waste surface.
   Landfill gas migrates upwards through this layer to perforated collection pipes connected to
   active gas extraction systems (flaring or energy recovery). Thickness: 0.3-0.5 m granular,
   or 5-20 mm geocomposite equivalent.

2. **Mineral sealing layer (clay or similar):** a layer of compacted low-permeability material
   (k ≤ 10⁻⁹ m/s) required by Annex I of DL 183/2009 for non-hazardous landfills. Minimum
   thickness: 0.5 m. This layer provides the primary hydraulic barrier but has poor resistance
   to desiccation cracking. For hazardous waste landfills, the requirement is k ≤ 10⁻⁹ m/s
   with a geomembrane above.

3. **Geomembrane layer (EPDM):** installed above the mineral layer, providing a redundant
   hydraulic barrier and the primary protection against desiccation cracking of the clay layer
   below. The EPDM geomembrane is the critical element for long-term integrity. Thickness: 1.5
   mm (minimum) to 2.0 mm for exposed or high-settlement applications.

4. **Drainage layer:** granular material or geocomposite drainage mat installed above the
   geomembrane. Collects precipitation that penetrates the topsoil/vegetation layer and diverts
   it to perimeter drainage. Prevents ponding of water on top of the geomembrane. Thickness:
   0.3 m granular or geocomposite equivalent.

5. **Restoration/recultivation layer (topsoil):** the upper layer that supports vegetation.
   Minimum thickness specified in DL 183/2009 and related guidance varies by vegetation type:
   0.6-1.0 m for grassland/meadow, 1.0-1.5 m for woodland. This layer provides thermal
   insulation for the geomembrane against frost and temperature extremes.

## Differential Settlement — The Critical Design Challenge

Municipal solid waste has extremely high compressibility and continues to settle under its own
weight and under any applied loading for years to decades after waste deposition. The primary
settlement mechanisms are:

**Primary (mechanical) compression:** occurs relatively rapidly, typically within the first
1-5 years after waste placement. Under the overburden of a typical Portuguese aterro sanitário
(20-30 m waste height), primary compression typically produces 5-15% of initial waste height.

**Secondary (creep) compression:** slower, biological and physico-chemical compression driven
by decomposition of organic waste fractions, gas generation and escape, and creep of waste mass.
May continue for 20-50 years. Produces an additional 5-20% settlement.

**Differential settlement:** the most dangerous for cap integrity. Arises from:
- Non-uniform waste types and densities across the landfill footprint
- Variable thickness of waste in different cells
- Different ages of waste (older waste has already settled; newer adjacent waste is still active)
- Heterogeneous distribution of gas voids within the waste mass

The cap geomembrane must accommodate differential settlement without tearing. EPDM's 400%+
elongation means that even severe differential settlement, producing local strains of 50-100%
across anchor trenches or settlement fractures, is well within the material's capacity. A 1.5 mm
EPDM cap membrane on a 30 m waste mass with 25% total settlement (7.5 m) and a differential
settlement of 2 m across a 10 m width will experience approximately 10% tensile strain — a
small fraction of EPDM's capacity.

For comparison, HDPE geomembrane at 2.0 mm thickness has similar elongation at break figures
in laboratory testing but is known to be susceptible to stress cracking (oxidative embrittlement
at low tensile stresses, particularly in the presence of surfactants from leachate). The GRI
GM13 stress cracking test requirement for HDPE cap geomembranes requires a minimum service life
of 100 hours in the notched constant tensile load (NCTL) test — a requirement that EPDM,
which is not susceptible to stress cracking by molecular mechanism, comfortably exceeds.

## Gas Collection Integration with EPDM Cap

The integration of the biogas collection system with the cap membrane is one of the most
technically demanding aspects of landfill capping. Landfill gas must be prevented from migrating
through the cap into the atmosphere (for environmental and safety reasons) while simultaneously
being collected and routed to treatment.

The EPDM cap creates an effective gas-tight barrier, but penetrations must be made at every
gas collection pipe riser. These penetrations are handled with purpose-built EPDM pipe boots
and mechanical compression flanges — the same technology used for roof penetrations. Each
penetration is seal-tested before the cap is covered with drainage layer and topsoil.

For landfills where active gas extraction is planned (flaring or energy recovery), the gas
collection layer below the EPDM acts as a plenum that allows gas to migrate horizontally to
collection risers without pressurising the geomembrane from below. The spacing and capacity
of gas collection pipes is designed to maintain gas pressure below the geomembrane at or below
atmospheric — excessive gas pressure below the cap would create uplift forces on the EPDM.

For smaller or lower-productivity landfills where passive gas venting is used rather than
active extraction, the EPDM cap must include purpose-designed venting points (passive gas
vents) at regular intervals — typically every 0.25-1.0 hectares depending on gas generation
rate — that allow gas to escape to atmosphere without pressurising the membrane.

## EPDM vs HDPE and GCL for Landfill Capping

### HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)

HDPE geomembrane (typically 1.5-2.5 mm, sometimes 1.0 mm for caps) is the most widely used
geomembrane globally for both base liner and cap applications. Its limitations for cap applications
are distinct from its performance in base liner service:

**Thermal expansion:** HDPE has a coefficient of linear thermal expansion of approximately
1.5 × 10⁻⁴ /°C, roughly three times that of EPDM. On a 100 m wide landfill cap exposed to
summer/winter temperature swings of 40°C, an HDPE panel will expand and contract by
approximately 600 mm in a day. This thermal movement must be accommodated by surface wrinkles
(which are aesthetically tolerable but can trap air and interfere with drainage) or by stresses
at the anchor trenches (which cause fatigue cracking over time). EPDM's lower thermal expansion
coefficient (approximately 0.7 × 10⁻⁴ /°C) combined with its elastomeric nature means it
simply stretches and contracts without developing surface wrinkles or anchor stress.

**Stress cracking:** HDPE is susceptible to environmental stress cracking (ESC) — a form of
slow crack growth that occurs at stresses well below the yield stress of the material, in the
presence of surface-active agents. On landfill caps, surfactants from decomposing organic waste
in the leachate that contacts the underside of the geomembrane can act as ESC agents. Published
failure analyses of HDPE cap geomembranes have identified ESC as a mechanism for premature
failure. EPDM is not susceptible to stress cracking — its failure mechanism under sustained
load is creep, which is predictable and does not lead to brittle sudden failure.

**Installation on irregular terrain:** HDPE geomembrane panels are typically 5-7 m wide and
must be thermally welded in the field. Welding quality is sensitive to temperature, humidity,
surface contamination, and operator skill. On the irregular surface of a landfill (uneven
waste mass, slopes, terraces), achieving consistently high-quality seams is challenging. EPDM
can be supplied in large-format panels (widths to 15.25 m, lengths to several hundred metres),
dramatically reducing the number of field seams required.

### GCL (Geosynthetic Clay Liner)

GCL combines a layer of bentonite clay (naturally low-permeability mineral) encapsulated
between two geotextile layers. GCL is widely used as an alternative to compacted clay in base
liner systems. For cap applications, GCL has a specific limitation: desiccation.

When bentonite dries out, it shrinks and cracks — significantly increasing its permeability
from the design value of approximately 10⁻¹¹ m/s to values of 10⁻⁷ m/s or higher. On a
landfill cap, the cover soil layer can dry out significantly during hot, dry summers. If the
soil layer above the GCL is thin or poorly established, the GCL is susceptible to desiccation
cycles that progressively damage its hydraulic performance. EPDM geomembrane is not affected
by desiccation — it is impermeable regardless of moisture content, and its physical properties
are not affected by dry conditions.

## European and Portuguese Regulatory Requirements for Landfill Caps

### Decreto-Lei n.º 183/2009

The primary Portuguese legislation for landfill engineering is DL 183/2009, which transposes
EU Directive 99/31/EC. The technical requirements for cap systems are defined in Annex I,
Seção 3 (Technical specifications for closure and aftercare). Key requirements:

**For non-hazardous waste landfills (including MSW):**
- Minimum 0.5 m of material with hydraulic conductivity k ≤ 10⁻⁹ m/s (compacted clay or
  equivalent barrier)
- Artificial geomembrane liner above the mineral barrier where required by risk assessment
- Minimum 1.0 m drainage layer above the sealing system
- Recultivation layer (topsoil) suitable for vegetation establishment
- Sufficient slope to promote runoff without causing erosion (typically 3-5% minimum slope)

**For hazardous waste landfills:**
- Artificial geomembrane (minimum 2.0 mm HDPE-equivalent, which EPDM at 1.5-2.0 mm satisfies
  in terms of hydraulic performance given its higher elongation and resistance to stress cracking)
- Mineral barrier k ≤ 10⁻⁹ m/s, minimum 0.5 m
- Gas collection where hazardous gas generation is identified

**APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente) oversight:**
APA is the Portuguese environmental regulatory authority that oversees landfill licensing,
operation, and closure. Post-closure monitoring requirements specified in DL 183/2009 include:
- Groundwater quality monitoring at defined monitoring wells
- Leachate quantity and quality monitoring
- Landfill gas monitoring
- Topographic surveys to track settlement
- Cap integrity monitoring (visual inspection, leakage rate estimation)

The post-closure monitoring period is a minimum of 30 years from the date of closure, with
APA having discretion to extend this period where monitoring data indicates continued
environmental risk.

### EU Landfill Directive (Directive 1999/31/EC) and Revision

The original EU Landfill Directive established the framework that DL 183/2009 transposes.
The revision of this directive (as part of the EU Circular Economy Package, Directive 2018/850)
tightened restrictions on landfilling of municipal waste — requiring reduction to maximum 10%
of MSW landfilled by 2035 — which means that existing landfills are facing closure decisions
sooner than originally planned as recycling and composting rates increase. This accelerates
the pipeline of cap installations at active Portuguese aterros sanitários.

### PERSU Strategy Documents

Portugal's Plano Estratégico para os Resíduos Urbanos (PERSU) has set progressive targets for
waste diversion from landfill. Under PERSU 2030 (published 2021), the target is to reduce
landfilling of MSW to 10% of total municipal waste generated by 2035. The consequence is
accelerated closure of landfill cells — and correspondingly, accelerated demand for compliant
final cap systems.

## Post-Closure Management and Long-Term Performance

The post-closure phase of a landfill — the period after the final cap is installed and before
the site is released from regulatory oversight — is the period during which the cap must
perform its most demanding long-term service. The principal challenges during this phase are:

**Ongoing settlement:** as described above, secondary compression and biological decomposition
of waste continue for decades. The cap must accommodate this settlement without developing
hydraulic breaches.

**Vegetation establishment and root penetration:** the cover soil layer is progressively
colonised by vegetation. Tree roots from volunteer species (those that establish naturally
without planting) can penetrate to depth over decades. The EPDM geomembrane must resist
root penetration throughout this period. EPDM's root resistance, demonstrated in green roof
applications per FLL and EN 13948, provides confidence for this long-term requirement.

**Methane oxidation in cover soil:** naturally occurring methane-oxidising bacteria (methanotrophs)
in the cover soil layer oxidise methane that passes through the EPDM geomembrane via diffusion.
This biological oxidation layer acts as a final safety net for methane emissions.

**Leachate generation from cap infiltration:** if the cap system fails hydraulically, precipitation
percolating through the cap increases leachate generation below the waste. Monitoring of leachate
quantity is therefore an indirect indicator of cap integrity.

---

## Methane Capture and Energy Recovery

The landfill gas generated by MSW landfills is primarily methane — a potent greenhouse gas
(global warming potential 84 times that of CO₂ over 20 years). Portuguese law and EU policy
require active management of landfill gas. Options are:

**Active gas collection and flaring:** gas is extracted through a network of vertical extraction
wells and perforated horizontal collectors in the gas drainage layer below the cap, compressed,
and flared. This converts methane to CO₂ (less potent greenhouse gas) while destroying VOCs
and odorous compounds. This is the minimum acceptable approach under current Portuguese and EU
regulatory standards.

**Energy recovery:** at larger landfills with significant gas generation rates, the collected
methane is used to generate electricity in gas engines (landfill gas-to-energy, LFGE). Several
Portuguese aterros sanitários operate LFGE systems — Valorsul's São João da Talha facility and
LIPOR's Sermonde aterro among them.

The EPDM cap plays a critical role in gas management: it prevents atmospheric oxygen from
entering the waste mass from above (which would inhibit methanogenic bacteria and reduce gas
yield) while preventing methane from escaping to atmosphere at any point other than through
the active collection system. An intact, high-quality EPDM cap maximises gas collection
efficiency and therefore maximises energy recovery.
