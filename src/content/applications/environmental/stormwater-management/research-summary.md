# Stormwater Management — EPDM Research Summary

## The Stormwater Challenge in Portugal

Stormwater management has become one of the most pressing challenges in Portuguese civil and environmental engineering. Portugal's rainfall regime is characterised by extreme seasonality: prolonged dry summers — particularly in the south — followed by intense autumn and winter rainfall events that overwhelm urban drainage infrastructure designed for average flows, not peak events. The Atlantic coast receives 700-1,200 mm of annual precipitation; the interior north exceeds 2,000 mm in some mountain catchments; the south averages 400-600 mm but with high storm intensity coefficients.

The combination of intense rainfall events, increasing urban impermeability (sealed roads, car parks, roofs), and ageing drainage infrastructure creates chronic stormwater flooding, water quality degradation, and loss of groundwater recharge — all of which are worsening under climate change projections for the Iberian Peninsula.

The engineering response to this challenge is increasingly dominated by Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) — a family of design approaches that slow, infiltrate, treat and attenuate stormwater close to where it falls, rather than channelling it rapidly to watercourses. EPDM membrane plays a central and irreplaceable role in multiple components of the SuDS toolkit: lining retention ponds, detention basins, bioswales, constructed wetlands, and storage tanks where a watertight but environmentally inert membrane is required.

## EPDM Chemistry and Stormwater Application

EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) is the material of choice for stormwater containment for reasons that are rooted in its molecular architecture:

**Chemical inertness to natural water chemistry:** Stormwater is a complex chemical mixture that varies significantly depending on catchment land use. Urban stormwater typically contains:
- Suspended solids from road surfaces (0-500 mg/L during events)
- Hydrocarbons (petrol, oil) from traffic surfaces: 0.5-10 mg/L total petroleum hydrocarbons
- Heavy metals (zinc from galvanised roofing, lead from old paintwork, copper from brake dust): 10-500 µg/L
- Chloride from road de-icing salts: 0-2,000 mg/L in treated road catchments
- Nitrates and phosphates from agricultural and urban runoff
- Biologically active compounds including pesticides, detergents, and pathogens

EPDM's saturated carbon-carbon backbone is chemically inert to all of these compounds. Unlike HDPE, which is crystalline and can absorb hydrocarbon compounds over decades causing molecular swell and dimensional change, EPDM's cross-linked elastomeric network resists hydrocarbon absorption (though it is not rated for concentrated hydrocarbon immersion — stormwater concentrations are far below this threshold). Unlike concrete and clay, EPDM does not leach calcium, aluminium or other mineral ions that can affect water chemistry in ecologically sensitive receiving water bodies.

**Key physical properties for stormwater applications:**
- Elongation at break: 400-500% — accommodates differential settlement in earthworks without tearing
- Tensile strength: 9-12 N/mm²
- Puncture resistance: critical for geo-membrane applications where stone or root penetration is possible
- Service temperature: -45°C to +130°C — relevant in Portugal given summer soil temperatures that can exceed 50-60°C in sun-exposed pond beds
- UV resistance: critical in shallow water systems where membrane is periodically exposed during low-water periods

## Stormwater System Types and EPDM Roles

### Retention Ponds (Bacias de Retenção)

Retention ponds are excavated basins that store stormwater runoff and release it slowly to receiving water bodies or allow infiltration. They are the most common large-scale SuDS feature in Portuguese urban developments and infrastructure projects.

EPDM is used when:
- Soils are insufficiently permeable to allow natural infiltration (clay soils common in Beira Litoral)
- Groundwater contamination risk from stormwater requires full containment
- Flood attenuation requires a defined storage volume independent of soil infiltration rate
- Habitat creation is desired but requires a waterproof base to maintain water level independent of rainfall

Standard specification for Portuguese retention ponds: 1.0 mm EPDM (small amenity ponds) to 1.5 mm (standard infrastructure ponds) over a geotextile protection layer. Earthwork slopes typically 1:2 to 1:3 (V:H). EPDM terminated in anchor trench at design top water level plus 300 mm freeboard.

Portuguese infrastructure projects (motorways, urban roads, commercial developments) are routinely required by the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA) to include stormwater retention as part of Environmental Impact Assessment commitments.

### Bioswales (Valas de Biofiltração)

Bioswales are vegetated linear channels that slow, filter and partially treat stormwater runoff as it flows from a source (car park, road surface) toward a receiving watercourse or basin. They combine conveyance with treatment — suspended solids settle, hydrocarbons are adsorbed by the vegetation root zone, and microbial communities in the root zone biodegrade organic compounds.

EPDM is used in the base of bioswales when:
- The soil permeability is too high and water must be retained for treatment contact time
- A defined flow path must be maintained independent of seasonal variations
- The bioswale discharges to a sensitive watercourse where outflow quantity must be controlled

The EPDM base liner of a bioswale is typically 1.0-1.5 mm thick, installed in the excavated channel below the growing medium (typically 300-600 mm of engineered gravel-sand-compost mix). EPDM in this application must accommodate root penetration resistance (EN 13948 test — same standard as green roof root barriers) as vegetation roots can penetrate standard waterproofing membranes over years of growth.

### Detention Basins (Bacias de Detenção)

Detention basins differ from retention ponds in that they are designed primarily to attenuate peak flows — they fill rapidly during storm events and discharge at a controlled rate, but are typically dry between events. This use pattern creates specific demands on the EPDM:

- Wet-dry cycling: repeated wetting and drying causes differential thermal expansion and contraction in the membrane. EPDM's low thermal expansion coefficient (approximately 15-20 x 10⁻⁵ /°C) and high elongation (400%) accommodate this easily.
- UV exposure: during dry periods, the membrane is fully exposed to UV. EPDM's intrinsic UV resistance (carbon black-loaded, saturated backbone) means no degradation during exposure periods.
- Impact loading during fill: rapid fill events can deposit stones, debris and sediment on the membrane — EPDM's puncture resistance (EN 12691) and high elongation protect it from mechanical damage during fill events.

Detention basins in Portugal are increasingly required for commercial and industrial developments under the technical guidance of LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil), which publishes stormwater management design guidelines.

### Constructed Wetlands (Zonas Húmidas Construídas)

Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that use aquatic plants, substrate and microbial communities to treat stormwater or wastewater. In Portugal, they are increasingly used for:
- Secondary treatment of domestic wastewater in rural areas
- Polishing of stormwater from urban and agricultural catchments
- Habitat creation and ecological compensation in development projects

EPDM is the membrane of choice for constructed wetlands for the same reasons it is used in natural swimming pools: no plasticiser migration that would affect the ecological function of the system, root resistance (FLL / EN 13948 tested), UV stability in shallow margins, and chemical inertness that ensures no leaching of compounds that could affect water quality.

Constructed wetlands in Portugal are regulated under Decreto-Lei 152/97 (which transposed EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive) and subsequent amendments, and under the Water Framework Directive (Directiva Quadro da Água), implemented in Portugal via Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005).

## EPDM vs Alternative Lining Materials for Stormwater

### EPDM vs HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)

HDPE is the principal competitor to EPDM in large-scale geomembrane applications. The technical comparison:

**Crystallinity and flexibility:** HDPE is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic. It is stiffer than EPDM (elongation at break typically 200-700% but with high strain hardening) and less able to accommodate differential settlement in earthworks without the formation of wrinkles. EPDM as a cross-linked elastomer distributes strain uniformly through the membrane.

**Seaming:** HDPE seams are welded using fusion welding (extrusion welding or hot wedge welding), requiring specialised equipment and calibration. EPDM seams use cold-applied adhesive tape systems (QuickSeam) that can be applied in a wider range of weather conditions and are more amenable to on-site quality verification.

**Thermal expansion:** HDPE has a coefficient of linear thermal expansion approximately 10x that of EPDM. In large exposed installations (e.g., reservoir covers, large ponds), HDPE wrinkling due to thermal expansion is a significant management challenge. EPDM is essentially wrinkle-free in service.

**Hydrocarbon resistance:** HDPE has better resistance to concentrated hydrocarbons than EPDM. For stormwater applications (dilute hydrocarbon concentrations), both are suitable. For chemical containment with concentrated hydrocarbons, HDPE is preferred.

**Root resistance:** EPDM has been systematically tested and certified for root resistance (EN 13948 / FLL); HDPE is also root resistant but the test protocol and certification are not as well established in European standards.

### EPDM vs Concrete Lining

Concrete-lined channels and ponds have been the traditional stormwater infrastructure material in Portugal for decades. Their limitations:

- Concrete is brittle: ground settlement, root growth and thermal cycling cause cracking that allows stormwater infiltration or groundwater ingress
- Cracked concrete in stormwater ponds is essentially unrepaired in practice — the cost and disruption of concrete repair is prohibitive
- Concrete leaches calcium carbonate and alkalises the water body — relevant for ecologically designed ponds
- Concrete requires significant structural thickness (150-300 mm) adding cost and dead load; EPDM at 1.5 mm achieves equivalent impermeability
- Concrete has zero elongation — any substrate movement is transmitted directly as cracking

EPDM advantage: 400% elongation bridges all anticipated settlement movements in earthwork substrates; no crack propagation mechanism; 50-year service life without maintenance.

### EPDM vs Clay Lining (Compacted Clay or Bentonite)

Compacted clay and bentonite-based geosynthetic liners (GCLs) are used in low-cost retention pond applications. Their limitations:

- Clay liners require consistent moisture content during installation (difficult in summer in Portugal) and can desiccate and crack if the pond dries out completely — a common situation in southern Portugal where detention basins may be dry for months
- GCLs (bentonite blankets) can be damaged by freeze-thaw cycling (not normally relevant in Portugal) and by high-ionic-strength water (relevant where road salt is used — A1, A2, A3 motorway catchments in northern Portugal)
- Clay liners have no tensile strength — any differential settlement causes linear cracking
- Clay and GCL systems require careful quality control of compaction and overlap during installation; defects are difficult to detect non-destructively

EPDM advantage: no moisture requirement during installation; resistant to desiccation cracking; performs in high ionic strength environments; verifiable seam quality.

## Portuguese Regulatory Framework for Stormwater Management

### National Water Law (Lei da Água, Lei 58/2005)

Portugal's Water Law transposes the EU Water Framework Directive. It establishes:
- Classification of surface water bodies by ecological and chemical status
- Requirements for Member States to achieve good ecological status by 2027
- Regulation of discharges to water bodies, including stormwater
- The principle of integrated river basin management

Stormwater management infrastructure must be designed to protect receiving water body status. Infrastructure that prevents degraded stormwater from reaching water bodies of good ecological status is increasingly required by APA in licensing decisions.

### Regime of Water Resource Use (DL 226-A/2007)

This Decreto-Lei establishes the licensing framework for the use of water resources, including:
- Discharges of stormwater to watercourses above defined thresholds
- Licensing of retention and detention structures that intercept runoff
- Requirements for monitoring of discharge quality

### Environmental Impact Assessment (AIA)

Large infrastructure projects in Portugal (roads, commercial developments above 5 ha, industrial facilities) are subject to AIA under the EIA Directive (Diretiva 2011/92/UE), implemented by Decreto-Lei 151-B/2013. AIA conditions routinely require:
- Quantitative stormwater attenuation to limit peak discharge rates to pre-development levels
- First-flush treatment to remove suspended solids, hydrocarbons and metals before discharge
- Long-term monitoring of discharge water quality

EPDM-lined retention and treatment systems are a standard response to AIA stormwater conditions in Portugal.

### Municipal Regulations (RSTU and Local Stormwater Plans)

Portuguese municipalities are increasingly producing Planos Municipais de Gestão de Águas Pluviais (Municipal Stormwater Management Plans) following guidance from APA and ERSAR (Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos). These plans are introducing specific requirements for:
- Stormwater separation from wastewater in urban drainage networks
- Mandatory on-site attenuation for new developments
- Use of SuDS techniques in public space design

## Climate Change Context for Portugal

IPCC projections for the Iberian Peninsula (confirmed by Portuguese national climate adaptation strategy ENAAC 2020 and its successor P-3A — Programa de Ação para a Adaptação às Alterações Climáticas) include:
- Mean temperature increase of 1.5-3°C by 2050 (3-5°C by 2100 under high-emission scenarios)
- Reduction of mean annual precipitation in southern Portugal of 10-20% by 2050
- Increase in precipitation intensity — more rainfall in fewer, more intense events
- Longer dry periods punctuated by more intense storm events

This combination of drier conditions and more intense storms is the worst case for stormwater management: soils are baked dry and hydrophobic during long dry periods, then subjected to intense rainfall that generates extremely rapid runoff. The retention capacity of existing green infrastructure is reduced; the peak attenuation benefit of stormwater structures increases in value.

EPDM-lined stormwater systems are specifically well-suited to this climate scenario: they perform in both the dry storage phase (UV resistant, desiccation resistant) and the rapid fill phase (accommodates impact loading, high elongation for settlement), and they maintain their waterproof integrity without maintenance interventions between rare storm events.

## Sizing Principles for Portuguese Conditions

Design rainfall for stormwater infrastructure in Portugal is typically derived from:
- SNIRH (Sistema Nacional de Informação de Recursos Hídricos) rainfall intensity records
- IDF (Intensity-Duration-Frequency) curves for specific meteorological stations
- LNEC Technical Guide for Urban Stormwater Management

Typical design return periods in Portugal:
- Urban drainage minor system: 2-10 years
- Major flood route / retention basins: 100 years
- Critical infrastructure: 1,000 years or PMF (Probable Maximum Flood)

For a 100-year return period design event, typical rainfall depths in Portugal:
- Lisbon area: 65-90 mm in 1 hour
- Porto area: 55-75 mm in 1 hour
- Faro/Algarve: 50-80 mm in 1 hour (with higher variability)
- Interior mountain catchments: 80-120 mm in 1 hour

Storage volume calculation for a retention pond serving a typical urban catchment:
- Runoff coefficient (impermeability): 0.7-0.9 for urban commercial areas
- Peak attenuation: design to limit outflow to pre-development greenfield rate (typically 2-5 L/s/ha)
- Required storage: typically 200-500 m³/ha of impervious catchment for 100-year event

These storage volumes are routinely accommodated by EPDM-lined excavated retention ponds sized by qualified hydraulic engineers working to APA and LNEC guidelines.

## Environmental Performance of EPDM in Ecological Stormwater Systems

A key differentiator of EPDM over competing geomembrane materials in ecologically designed stormwater systems is its proven compatibility with aquatic ecosystems:

**No plasticiser leaching:** EPDM contains no plasticisers. This is critical in retention ponds and constructed wetlands where the water body hosts or discharges to ecologically sensitive receiving water bodies. Studies of plasticiser migration from PVC geomembranes have shown measurable concentrations of phthalate compounds in standing water after extended PVC exposure — compounds associated with endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms.

**No carbon leaching:** EPDM contains approximately 30-50% carbon black by weight, but this is a solid filler that is physically entrapped in the cross-linked elastomeric matrix. Carbon black does not leach into water. EPDM geomembranes have been used extensively in drinking water reservoirs, fishponds and aquaculture systems with no adverse water quality effects.

**Aquatic life compatibility:** Field studies of wildlife in and around EPDM-lined retention ponds have consistently found normal colonisation by amphibians, invertebrates, waterfowl and vegetation. EPDM-lined ponds are commonly used by conservation organisations in the UK, Netherlands and Germany for habitat creation specifically because of their ecological inertness.

**End-of-life recyclability:** EPDM membrane is recyclable into granulated rubber that is used in sports surfaces, playground tiles and acoustic insulation. This is a relevant consideration for infrastructure with 50-year lifespans where regulatory requirements on end-of-life management may intensify.
