# Stormwater Management — Page Structure

## Strategic Rationale

Stormwater management is a technically specialised application that sits at the intersection of civil engineering, environmental regulation, and ecological design. The audience for this page is correspondingly diverse:

1. **Civil and environmental engineers** specifying geomembrane systems for retention ponds, detention basins and constructed wetlands on infrastructure and development projects
2. **Municipal and regional authorities** seeking solutions for public stormwater infrastructure that must comply with APA licensing conditions
3. **Developers and project managers** responding to Environmental Impact Assessment conditions that require stormwater attenuation and treatment
4. **Landscape architects and SuDS designers** incorporating bioswales, rain gardens and retention features into urban public space projects
5. **Environmental consultants** advising on climate adaptation for water-sensitive urban design

The page must establish Membriko's technical authority in a field where the specifier's primary concern is regulatory compliance, hydrological performance, and long-term reliability. The content must demonstrate understanding of Portuguese stormwater regulation (APA, ERSAR, Lei da Água) and European SuDS design practice, while communicating EPDM's specific advantages over HDPE, concrete, and clay in each system type.

The structure follows the specifier's decision journey: understand the problem (Portuguese stormwater challenge), understand the solution mechanism (why EPDM for stormwater infrastructure), understand the system types available, understand the installation and sizing approach, understand the regulatory context, understand environmental performance. FAQs capture the technical questions that arise in pre-contract specification conversations.

## Section 1: Introduction — The Portuguese Stormwater Challenge

**Purpose:** Establish the problem and its Portuguese-specific context to create immediate relevance for the reader.

**Content:**
- The paradox of Portuguese stormwater: a country of extreme rainfall seasonality — long dry summers followed by intense storm events — where urban drainage infrastructure designed for average flows is increasingly overwhelmed by peak events
- The cost of inadequate stormwater management: urban flooding (Lisbon 2023, Setúbal 2022, Évora 2019 events), water quality degradation in receiving water bodies, loss of groundwater recharge, infrastructure damage from uncontrolled flows
- The regulatory shift: APA increasingly conditioning development licences on stormwater attenuation and treatment; municipal SuDS plans being adopted across major Portuguese cities; the Water Framework Directive requiring good ecological status of water bodies receiving stormwater discharges
- Membriko's role: EPDM membrane is the waterproof lining that makes stormwater retention, detention, and treatment systems work — from small urban bioswales to large motorway retention ponds
- Stat block: 50+ years service life / pH 2-12 chemical resistance / 400% elongation for earthwork settlement / 20-year Membriko warranty
- Primary CTA: "Solicitar Especificação Técnica"

## Section 2: Why EPDM for Stormwater Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Establish the technical case — why EPDM is the correct membrane material for each class of stormwater system.

**Content:**
- The four requirements of any stormwater lining system: impermeability (no leakage between events); durability (UV exposure during dry periods, chemical exposure during storm events); ecological compatibility (no contamination of water body or receiving water); deformability (accommodation of earthwork settlement without membrane failure)
- How EPDM meets all four requirements: chemical inertness through saturated backbone (no reactions with stormwater chemistry); UV stability during dry-period exposure; zero plasticiser migration (critical for ecological water body compatibility); 400% elongation accommodating differential settlement in embankment substrates
- Physical data table:

| Property | Value | Test Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard) | 1.0 mm / 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Puncture resistance | ≥ 200 N | EN 12691 |
| UV resistance | No degradation at 2,000 hours | EN ISO 4892-3 |
| pH resistance | pH 2 to 12 | — |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ |
| Root resistance | Certified | EN 13948 / FLL |

- Why earthwork settlement accommodation matters: Portuguese stormwater retention ponds are typically earthwork structures — excavated and embankked in soil. Settlement of 50-100 mm in embankments over the first 5 years is normal. EPDM's 400% elongation distributes this settlement across the membrane without creating point stresses that cause tearing. Concrete and HDPE do not have this tolerance.

## Section 3: System Types — Retention Ponds, Bioswales, Detention Basins, Constructed Wetlands

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that Membriko's EPDM expertise covers every SuDS system type relevant to Portuguese practice.

**Content:** Four system type cards.

**Retention Ponds (Bacias de Retenção)**
- Function: store stormwater runoff and release slowly to receiving watercourse or infiltrate to groundwater; permanent water body
- Scale: typically 500-50,000 m² for urban and infrastructure applications
- EPDM specification: 1.0-1.5 mm over geotextile protection layer; geotextile weight ≥ 300 g/m² below, ≥ 200 g/m² above; anchor trench at top water level + 300 mm
- Membriko experience: motorway retention ponds (Estradas de Portugal / IP specifications); urban development retention features; ecological pond design for habitat compensation schemes

**Bioswales (Valas de Biofiltração)**
- Function: vegetated linear channels that slow and treat stormwater from roads, car parks, and impervious surfaces
- Scale: typically 0.5-5 m wide, 50-500 m long, 300-600 mm growing medium depth over EPDM
- EPDM specification: 1.0 mm EPDM in base of channel when soil permeability is too high or controlled outflow is required; root-resistant membrane essential (EN 13948)
- Design note: EPDM in bioswales must accommodate root penetration from the vegetation growing medium — root resistance certification is non-negotiable

**Detention Basins (Bacias de Detenção)**
- Function: store stormwater during peak storm events and release at controlled rate; typically dry between events
- Scale: typically 200-5,000 m² for urban applications; large open areas integrated into parks and green spaces
- EPDM specification: 1.0-1.5 mm; UV resistance and desiccation resistance critical (membrane is exposed during dry periods); EPDM excels vs clay (desiccation cracking) and HDPE (wrinkling)
- Design note: outlet control structure penetration through EPDM requires EPDM-flanged pipe sleeve; Membriko supplies and installs certified penetration systems

**Constructed Wetlands (Zonas Húmidas Construídas)**
- Function: engineered treatment systems using aquatic plants, substrate and microbial communities to treat stormwater or wastewater
- Scale: typically 500-5,000 m² for stormwater polishing; up to 50,000 m² for wastewater treatment substitution in rural areas
- EPDM specification: 1.0-1.5 mm; ecological compatibility paramount — zero plasticiser migration; root resistance for planted zones; Membriko uses only membrane grades with established aquatic ecosystem compatibility record
- Regulatory context: constructed wetland discharge is regulated under Decreto-Lei 152/97 and requires APA licensing

---

## Section 4: SuDS Integration — Membriko's Role in Sustainable Urban Drainage Design

**Purpose:** Position Membriko as a specialist contributor to the broader SuDS design team, not merely a materials supplier.

**Content:**
- What is SuDS: the hierarchy of stormwater management from source control (green roofs, permeable paving) to conveyance control (bioswales, filter strips) to storage and treatment (retention ponds, constructed wetlands) to safe discharge
- Where EPDM fits in the SuDS toolkit: as the waterproof lining element in all closed-base SuDS features — wherever water must be contained rather than allowed to infiltrate uncontrolled
- Membriko's design contribution: preliminary sizing advice for retention pond volumes based on catchment area and permeability; specification of EPDM grade and accessories for each SuDS element; interface with civil engineer's earthwork design and hydraulic engineer's outflow control design
- Project team integration: Membriko works with civil engineers (LNEC guidelines, EN 16933 standard), landscape architects (SuDS in public space), environmental consultants (AIA stormwater conditions) and contractors (earthwork specification coordination)
- Reference to Portuguese SuDS frameworks: APA Guia para a Avaliação do Impacte de Empreendimentos sobre os Recursos Hídricos; ERSAR guidance on urban drainage; LNEC publications on stormwater management

## Section 5: Installation Process (8 Steps)

**Purpose:** De-risk the specification decision by making the Membriko installation process predictable and professional.

**Content:** Numbered timeline.

1. **Technical Review and Sizing Consultation** — Membriko reviews project hydraulic design (retention volumes, outflow rates, catchment parameters) and confirms EPDM specification: thickness, grade, geotextile weights, anchor trench design, penetration details
2. **Earthwork and Substrate Coordination** — Membriko coordinates with civil contractor on substrate preparation requirements: geotextile specification, maximum stone size in bedding layer, slope tolerance, anchor trench dimensions
3. **Material Delivery and On-site Organisation** — EPDM rolls and geotextile rolls staged at site; cut plan confirmed against as-built earthwork dimensions; seam positions planned to minimise field seams and locate them on flat surfaces where possible
4. **Geotextile Installation** — Protection geotextile laid over prepared substrate; overlap joints at minimum 500 mm; anchored in trench at top edge; used as cushion to protect EPDM from any residual stone protrusions in substrate
5. **EPDM Membrane Deployment** — EPDM panels unrolled and positioned according to cut plan; minimum disturbance of geotextile below; membrane weight (approximately 1.4 kg/m² for 1.5 mm) means ballasting is required in exposed or windy conditions
6. **Seaming and Penetrations** — All seams bonded with QuickSeam tape and QuickPrime Plus primer system; seam width minimum 100 mm with 75 mm effective bond width; penetrations (inlet/outlet pipes, outflow control structures) installed with EPDM flanged sleeves and compression rings
7. **Anchor Trench and Edge Termination** — EPDM terminated in anchor trench at design top water level plus freeboard; trench backfilled and compacted; perimeter sealing with EPDM lap and sealant
8. **Inspection, Testing and Documentation** — Visual seam inspection; seam probe test (mechanical probe on all seams); photographic as-built record; Electronic Leak Detection (ELD) available for critical applications; 20-year Membriko warranty issued

## Section 6: Sizing for Portuguese Rainfall Conditions

**Purpose:** Demonstrate technical depth in hydrological sizing — differentiating Membriko from generic geomembrane suppliers.

**Content:**
- Portuguese rainfall context: IDF curves from SNIRH; typical 100-year design events by region (Lisboa 65-90 mm/hr; Porto 55-75 mm/hr; Algarve 50-80 mm/hr with high variability)
- Design return periods: minor system (2-10 years); major flood route (100 years); critical infrastructure (1,000 years or PMF)
- Runoff coefficient guidance: urban commercial 0.7-0.9; residential 0.5-0.7; green space 0.1-0.3
- Storage volume indicative sizing: 200-500 m³/ha impervious catchment for 100-year event attenuation to greenfield rates
- Design tool reference: Membriko provides preliminary sizing guidance in consultation with the project's hydraulic engineer; final design to LNEC published guidelines and APA licensing requirements
- Climate change note: APA recommends applying a 20% increase to design rainfall depths for infrastructure with >50-year design life to account for climate change intensification; EPDM-lined systems accommodate increased storage requirements through simple pond enlargement

## Section 7: EPDM vs HDPE vs Concrete vs Clay — Technical Comparison

**Purpose:** Provide the comparative data needed by specifiers evaluating competing geomembrane systems.

**Content:** Comparison table with 8 parameters.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE | Concrete | Compacted Clay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | 400% | 200-700%* | 0% | 0% |
| Settlement accommodation | Excellent | Moderate (wrinkling risk) | None — cracking | None — cracking |
| UV resistance (exposed) | Excellent — no degradation | Good but wrinkling | Good | Poor — desiccation cracking |
| Seaming method | Cold adhesive tape — any weather | Hot wedge / extrusion weld — weather sensitive | Cast-in-place | Compaction overlap |
| Ecological compatibility | Excellent — no plasticisers | Good | Moderate — calcium leaching | Good |
| Root resistance | Certified (EN 13948) | Good but not systematically certified | None | None |
| Service life | 50+ years | 30-50 years | 20-40 years (cracking) | 20-30 years |
| Dry-period performance | Excellent — UV and desiccation resistant | Wrinkling due to thermal expansion | Good | Desiccation cracking risk |

*HDPE elongation is highly strain-rate dependent and accompanied by significant stress whitening; not equivalent to EPDM's uniform elastic elongation.

Honest assessment: HDPE is competitive in large-area applications where automated seaming can be deployed and thermal wrinkling managed; concrete lining is appropriate for channels with abrasive sediment loads where EPDM would require protection; clay is cost-effective in applications with reliable year-round moisture. For the full-service versatility required across Portuguese stormwater applications — from small urban bioswales to large motorway retention ponds, from permanently wet ponds to seasonally dry detention basins — EPDM is the most technically versatile choice.

## Section 8: Environmental Benefits — Water Quality, Habitat, and Groundwater

**Purpose:** Address the ecological performance of EPDM-lined stormwater systems — a growing requirement from APA, environmental consultants and ecologically conscious clients.

**Content:**
- Water quality: EPDM-lined retention ponds support natural attenuation of stormwater pollutants (sedimentation, biological degradation, UV photolysis of organics); EPDM does not contribute chemical contamination to the water body — contrasted with concrete (pH elevation), clay (turbidity), and PVC (plasticiser migration)
- Habitat creation: EPDM-lined ponds colonised by amphibians (especially Discoglossus galganoi, Pelodytes punctatus and Triturus species in Portuguese context), invertebrates, and waterfowl; documented wildlife use of EPDM-lined ponds in UK, Dutch and German conservation projects
- Groundwater recharge: where stormwater cannot be safely discharged to surface water, EPDM-lined ponds can incorporate controlled infiltration structures (infiltration trenches on pond margins) that allow treated stormwater to recharge groundwater safely
- Carbon accounting: stormwater retention ponds that support emergent and aquatic vegetation sequester carbon in plant biomass and root zone organic matter; EPDM-lined ponds with established vegetation can be positive contributors to project carbon budgets

## Section 9: Technical Specifications

**Purpose:** Provide complete data for civil engineers and specifiers.

**Content:** Full technical data table.

| Property | Value | Test Standard |

## Section 10: Maintenance of EPDM-Lined Stormwater Systems

**Purpose:** Demonstrate low whole-life cost and practicality of maintenance for infrastructure owners.

**Content:**
- Annual inspection: visual inspection of EPDM membrane at low-water or dry-period access; check anchor trench perimeter; check penetration seals at inlet/outlet structures; check for mechanical damage from vegetation management equipment
- Sediment management: retention ponds accumulate sediment at rates of 20-100 mm/year depending on catchment; sediment removal by tracked excavator or suction dredge; EPDM protects from excavator bucket contact damage when covered by geotextile — Membriko recommends installing a sacrificial upper geotextile for ponds requiring regular dredging
- Vegetation management: emergent vegetation on EPDM slopes should be cut back annually to prevent root penetration over time; however, EN 13948-certified EPDM has demonstrated root resistance in systematic testing and field experience — the risk is low for well-specified membrane
- Seam repair: if seam damage occurs (from debris impact, animal activity, or maintenance equipment), EPDM repair by cold-applied patch and adhesive is quick and permanent; patch application is possible without dewatering using underwater EPDM adhesive systems for below-waterline repairs
- 25-year inspection: Membriko recommends a formal documented inspection at 25 years including seam probe testing and ELD survey; this provides the basis for warranty extension or membrane replacement planning

## Section 11: Portuguese Municipal Stormwater Regulations

**Purpose:** Provide regulatory confidence to the specifier and eliminate compliance uncertainty.

**Content:**
- Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005): transposition of EU Water Framework Directive; establishes obligation to achieve good ecological status in receiving water bodies; stormwater management systems discharging to water bodies must not degrade ecological or chemical status
- Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007: regime of water resource use; licensing of stormwater discharges and retention structures; APA is the licensing authority
- Environmental Impact Assessment (DL 151-B/2013): stormwater attenuation and treatment conditions routinely attached to AIA decisions for developments above defined thresholds; EPDM-lined systems are standard response to these conditions
- Portaria 175/2012: technical norms for wastewater discharge quality; relevant where constructed wetlands are used for wastewater treatment substitution (rural applications)
- Municipal SuDS plans: increasing number of Portuguese municipalities (Lisboa, Porto, Braga, Aveiro, Coimbra) developing SuDS requirements for new developments; typically 10-20 L/s/ha maximum discharge rates requiring storage; EPDM-lined systems sized to meet these requirements
- ERSAR guidelines: the water and waste regulator provides guidance on urban drainage system management including stormwater; quality-assured EPDM installations with documented testing contribute to demonstrating regulatory compliance

---

## Section 12: Climate Change Adaptation

**Purpose:** Address the growing awareness among Portuguese specifiers of climate change implications for stormwater infrastructure design.

**Content:**
- IPCC projections for Iberian Peninsula: mean temperature +1.5-3°C by 2050; rainfall becoming more intense and more seasonal (less frequent but higher intensity events)
- The design challenge: conventional drainage infrastructure sized for historical rainfall frequencies is increasingly undersized; stormwater retention volumes must be sized for a climate that is becoming more extreme
- APA recommendation: +20% on design rainfall depths for infrastructure with design life exceeding 50 years
- EPDM's climate resilience: EPDM-lined systems are inherently adaptable — pond volume can be increased by deepening or expanding the earthwork, with the EPDM simply cut larger; no change to the fundamental system type is needed to accommodate increased storage
- Longer dry periods: southern Portugal is projected to experience progressively longer dry periods between storm events; EPDM's UV resistance and desiccation resistance means the membrane performs identically whether the pond is wet or dry for months at a time — a specific advantage over clay (desiccation cracking) and HDPE (thermal wrinkling in exposed conditions)
- Membriko's 50-year design life: EPDM-lined stormwater systems installed by Membriko today are designed to serve through the 2075 climate conditions projected for Portugal — fully compatible with climate adaptation investment horizons

---

## Section 13: Urban vs Rural Applications

**Purpose:** Demonstrate the breadth of application contexts — from dense urban SuDS to large rural catchment management.

**Content:**

**Urban Applications:**
- Small urban bioswales and filter strips: serving car parks, road drainage, commercial developments; typically 50-500 m² EPDM area; often integrated with landscaping and public realm design; Membriko works with landscape architects and SuDS engineers
- Urban retention ponds in public parks: serving residential development catchments; typically 500-5,000 m² EPDM area; designed as amenity features with ecological value; requires careful geotextile and anchor specification for public safety
- Underground stormwater tanks: EPDM lining of precast concrete tank systems for car park and road drainage storage; typical applications under urban plazas and car parks where surface space is unavailable
- Roof stormwater harvesting: EPDM flat roof as primary collection surface feeding to storage tank (lined with EPDM or reinforced concrete); Membriko provides integrated roof-to-tank membrane specification

**Rural and Infrastructure Applications:**
- Motorway and road retention ponds: largest single application category in Portugal; typically 2,000-20,000 m² pond area; Estradas de Portugal (currently IP) specification for geomembrane systems; Membriko has installed EPDM systems on major Portuguese road infrastructure projects
- Agricultural stormwater management: irrigation runoff retention; farmyard drainage containment; pesticide and fertiliser runoff capture for controlled disposal or reuse
- Quarry and mining drainage: stormwater separation from process water at quarry sites; EPDM's chemical resistance to variable pH and suspended solids well-suited to quarry drainage catchments
- Rural constructed wetlands: treatment of combined stormwater and household wastewater in dispersed rural settlements not connected to municipal sewer; increasingly required by APA for rural building licences in sensitive catchments

## Section 14: FAQ (8 Questions)

**Purpose:** Capture technical questions from engineers, developers, and municipal authorities that arise in pre-contract specification conversations.

1. **Qual a espessura de EPDM adequada para uma bacia de retenção de pluviais?**
   For standard stormwater retention ponds on earthwork substrates, 1.0 mm EPDM over a 300 g/m² protective geotextile is the standard specification. Where the maximum water depth exceeds 3 m, or where the catchment contributes high levels of suspended solids with abrasive potential, 1.5 mm EPDM with a 400 g/m² geotextile is recommended. Membriko provides site-specific specification advice at no charge as part of the pre-contract technical consultation.

2. **O EPDM aguenta o efeito de secagem e re-enchimento cíclico de bacias de detenção?**
   Yes. Wet-dry cycling is a design condition for which EPDM is specifically well-suited. During dry periods, EPDM's UV resistance (intrinsic through carbon black loading and saturated polymer backbone) means the membrane does not degrade when exposed. Its low thermal expansion coefficient prevents the thermal wrinkling that HDPE experiences in the same conditions. During fill events, 400% elongation accommodates any differential movement in the earthwork substrate without membrane stress concentrations.

3. **Como se fixa a membrana EPDM no bordo superior de uma lagoa escavada?**
   The standard anchoring system for an excavated pond is a perimeter anchor trench located at the design top water level plus a minimum 300 mm freeboard. The trench is typically 300 mm wide by 300 mm deep, the EPDM is folded into the trench, and the trench is backfilled and compacted with selected granular material. The anchor trench provides both physical restraint against hydrostatic uplift and protection of the membrane edge from UV and mechanical damage. Membriko designs anchor trench details for each project based on the specific earthwork geometry.

4. **O EPDM é compatível com vida aquática e zonas húmidas construídas?**
   Yes. EPDM is the material of choice for constructed wetlands and ecologically designed retention ponds. It contains no plasticisers, biocides, or heavy metals that could migrate into the water and affect aquatic organisms or the biological treatment processes of the wetland. EPDM-lined ponds are routinely used by conservation organisations across Europe for ecological habitat creation. Membriko uses only EPDM grades with established records of aquatic ecosystem compatibility.

5. **Quais são as normas portuguesas e europeias que regulam a impermeabilização de bacias pluviais?**
   The primary European standard for synthetic geomembrane materials is EN 13956 (flexible membranes for waterproofing — synthetic polymer sheets), under which EPDM bears CE marking. For the geosynthetic application in earthwork structures, EN 13361 (geosynthetics for use in the construction of reservoirs and dams), EN 13362 (canals) and EN 13491 (geotextile barriers) are the relevant product standards. In Portugal, the regulatory framework is Lei 58/2005 (Water Law), Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007 (water resource use licensing), and APA's technical guidance on stormwater discharge licensing. Membriko provides full documentation for regulatory submissions.

6. **É possível instalar EPDM durante a época chuvosa de inverno em Portugal?**
   EPDM can be installed in wet and cold conditions that would prevent hot-welded HDPE installation. The cold-adhesive QuickSeam tape system used for EPDM seaming is effective at temperatures above 5°C and in light rain (seam surfaces must be clean and dry at the point of adhesive application). For earthwork projects in winter, the primary limitation is the civil contractor's ability to complete earthworks in acceptable soil moisture conditions — not the EPDM installation itself. Membriko coordinates with the civil contractor to sequence membrane installation at the earliest opportunity after earthwork completion.

7. **Como é que as saídas e estruturas de controlo de caudal atravessam a membrana EPDM?**
   All penetrations through EPDM membrane — inlet pipes, outlet pipes, outflow control structures, monitoring equipment — are made using EPDM-flanged pipe sleeves and stainless steel compression ring systems. The EPDM membrane is bonded around the pipe with QuickSeam tape, the flanged sleeve is positioned over the bond, and the stainless steel compression ring is torqued to create a watertight mechanical seal. No silicone or mastic sealants are used as primary seals. Membriko dimensions and supplies penetration accessories for each project specification.

8. **Qual é o custo de ciclo de vida de EPDM em comparação com betão ou HDPE para bacias pluviais?**
   EPDM has a higher initial material cost than compacted clay and is comparable to HDPE per unit area. However, the 50+ year service life without scheduled replacement, the zero maintenance cost of the membrane itself, and the avoidance of settlement-related repair costs produce a favourable whole-life cost position. Concrete-lined channels require repair of settlement cracks at 15-25 year intervals; EPDM-lined channels do not crack. Clay liners in southern Portugal require monitoring and repair of desiccation cracking after dry summers; EPDM does not desiccate. Membriko provides indicative whole-life cost comparisons at project specification stage for client decision-making.
