# EPDM Membrane for Stormwater Management Systems

## Section 1: The Portuguese Stormwater Challenge

Portugal occupies an awkward position in the European water story. In terms of mean annual rainfall, it sits well below the Western European average in its southern and interior regions — the Alentejo and Algarve receive just 400 to 600 millimetres per year. Yet Portugal floods. Catastrophically and repeatedly. The reason lies not in the volume of water that falls, but in when and how it falls — and in the infrastructure that has been asked to handle it.

The country's rainfall regime is defined by extreme seasonality. From May to September, rainfall across much of Portugal is negligible. Soils bake and crack. Urban surfaces accumulate months of tyre dust, hydrocarbon residues, heavy metal particles from brake pads and roofing materials, and suspended solids that wait for the first autumn downpour. When that downpour arrives — typically in October or November, often in the form of an Atlantic frontal system that has gathered energy over the ocean — it falls on ground that is physically incapable of absorbing it quickly. Hydrophobic, hardened soils. Impermeable urban surfaces that cover an ever-increasing proportion of catchment area. Drainage networks designed in the 1960s and 1970s for average flow conditions, not peak events.

The consequences have become an annual news cycle. The Lisbon metropolitan area has experienced severe flash flooding in 2023, 2019, and multiple events in between, with underground car parks inundated, road tunnels turned into rivers, and businesses along low-lying streets flooded in minutes. Setúbal, Évora, Faro, and dozens of medium-sized Portuguese cities face the same pattern: months of drought followed by hours of crisis. Beyond the immediate damage to property and infrastructure, each uncontrolled stormwater event carries a secondary cost: urban runoff laden with hydrocarbons, heavy metals, nitrates, and suspended solids discharges to rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters, degrading the ecological status that Portugal is obliged under the EU Water Framework Directive to protect and improve.

The engineering discipline that addresses this problem is Sustainable Urban Drainage — universally referred to as SuDS. Rather than racing stormwater to the nearest watercourse as quickly as possible, SuDS takes the opposite approach: slow the water down, store it close to where it falls, treat it before discharge, and release it at a rate the receiving watercourse can accommodate. The SuDS toolkit includes retention ponds, detention basins, bioswales, constructed wetlands, permeable paving, green roofs, and rain gardens. What the majority of these systems share — every one that relies on containing water rather than allowing it to percolate freely — is a watertight membrane lining.

That membrane is where Membriko works. Based in Pombal, Leiria, Membriko supplies and installs EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) geomembrane for the full range of stormwater management applications: from small urban bioswales serving a single car park to large motorway retention ponds protecting river catchments from the first-flush pollutant load of thousands of vehicles per day. This page explains why EPDM is the correct choice for Portuguese stormwater infrastructure, how it performs across every system type, and what the Membriko specification process involves from initial technical consultation through to installed and warranted membrane.

**At a glance:**
- 50+ year service life — designed to outlast the infrastructure it protects
- 400% elongation — accommodates earthwork settlement without membrane failure
- pH 2 to 12 chemical resistance — inert to all components of urban stormwater chemistry
- UV resistant throughout service life — performs equally in wet ponds and seasonally dry detention basins
- CE marked to EN 13956 and tested to EN 13491
- 20-year Membriko warranty on installed systems

## Section 2: Why EPDM Is the Right Membrane for Stormwater Infrastructure

Not every geomembrane material is suited to every application. Stormwater management systems impose a specific and demanding combination of requirements that eliminates several competing materials and makes EPDM the technically correct specification across the broadest range of Portuguese conditions.

### The Four Requirements of Any Stormwater Lining System

**Impermeability between events.** A retention pond that slowly leaks between storm events is not providing the attenuation and treatment function it was designed for. It may also be contaminating the groundwater below the pond bed. EPDM at 1.14 mm to 1.5 mm thickness, tested to EN 1928 Method B at 60 kPa hydrostatic pressure, provides continuous impermeability throughout its service life with no degradation in hydraulic performance. Membriko specifies EPDM with CE marking to EN 13956 as the baseline quality standard for all stormwater applications.

**Durability under stormwater chemistry.** Urban stormwater is chemically complex. It contains suspended solids at concentrations that vary from near-zero between events to 500 mg/L during peak runoff; hydrocarbons from road surfaces at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mg/L; heavy metals including zinc from galvanised roofing, copper from brake dust, and lead from older paintwork; chlorides from de-icing salts on major roads; and biological material including microbial pathogens and organic compounds. A geomembrane that degrades when exposed to any of these components is not fit for purpose in a stormwater application. EPDM's saturated carbon-carbon polymer backbone is chemically inert to all components of urban stormwater at the concentrations typically encountered — a property that Membriko verifies against EN 13956 chemical resistance classifications.

**Ecological compatibility.** Stormwater management systems — particularly retention ponds and constructed wetlands — are increasingly designed as ecological assets: habitat for amphibians, invertebrates, and waterfowl; biological treatment systems that rely on microbial communities in the water column and substrate; and systems that discharge to water bodies of ecological significance under the Water Framework Directive. A membrane that leaches plasticisers, biocides, or mineral compounds into the water body compromises both the ecological value of the system and its regulatory water quality obligations. EPDM contains no plasticisers, no biocides, and no extractable compounds that adversely affect water chemistry or aquatic organisms.

**Deformability to accommodate earthwork settlement.** Portuguese stormwater retention ponds are predominantly earthwork structures — excavated basins and compacted embankments in natural soil. Settlement of embankments in the first five years of service is normal and expected: 50 to 100 mm of differential movement across a pond perimeter is not unusual in the Beira Litoral clay soils where Membriko regularly installs systems. A rigid lining — concrete or even a relatively stiff thermoplastic geomembrane — transmits this settlement as stress concentrations that cause cracking or tearing at the points of greatest movement. EPDM's elongation at break of 400% distributes any settlement movement uniformly across the membrane surface without creating stress concentrations. The membrane deforms elastically with the substrate, and then recovers when the settlement stabilises.

### EPDM Physical Properties — Technical Data for Stormwater Applications

| Property | Value | Test Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Thickness (standard) | 1.14 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Thickness (infrastructure grade) | 1.5 mm | EN 1849-2 |
| Tensile strength | ≥ 9 N/mm² | EN 12311-2 |
| Elongation at break | ≥ 400% | EN 12311-2 |
| Tear resistance | ≥ 20 N/mm | EN 12310-2 |
| Puncture resistance | ≥ 200 N | EN 12691 |
| Hydrostatic watertightness | Pass at 60 kPa | EN 1928 (Method B) |
| pH resistance | pH 2 to 12 | — |
| Service temperature | -45°C to +130°C | — |
| UV resistance | No cracking at 2,000 hours exposure | EN ISO 4892-3 |
| Root resistance | Pass — certified | EN 13948 / FLL |
| Dimensional stability | < 1% | EN 1107-2 |
| Service life | 50+ years | ERA/SKZ independent assessment |
| CE marking | Yes | EN 13956 / EN 13491 |

The service temperature range deserves specific attention in the Portuguese context. In summer, the bed of a dry detention basin — dark EPDM membrane exposed to direct solar radiation — can reach 60°C or above at the membrane surface. Standard thermoplastic geomembranes soften and deform at these temperatures. EPDM, rated to +130°C, maintains its dimensional stability and physical properties throughout, emerging from the Portuguese summer in identical condition to that in which it entered it.

Membriko selects EPDM grades with established track records in stormwater infrastructure applications across Portugal and Europe. The Membriko specification is not a generic geomembrane — it is an EPDM system that includes correctly specified protection geotextiles, tested QuickSeam adhesive seaming systems, and certified pipe penetration accessories, all supplied and installed by Membriko as an integrated package with a single point of responsibility.

## Section 3: Stormwater System Types — Where Membriko EPDM Is Applied

Membriko's experience covers every principal SuDS system type used in Portuguese stormwater management practice. Each system type imposes distinct performance requirements, and each is addressed by a specific Membriko EPDM specification.

### Retention Ponds (Bacias de Retenção)

Retention ponds are the workhorse of Portuguese stormwater management. They are excavated basins — typically 500 to 50,000 square metres of water surface — that store stormwater runoff and release it slowly to a receiving watercourse, allow it to infiltrate to groundwater through a permeable pond bed, or retain it as a permanent amenity water feature. The Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA) routinely conditions motorway, commercial development, and industrial facility licences on the provision of retention ponds sized to attenuate peak flows to pre-development levels.

EPDM lining is specified for retention ponds when soils are insufficiently permeable for natural infiltration — a common condition in the Beira Litoral clay soils from which Membriko operates — or when groundwater protection requirements mandate full containment of potentially contaminated stormwater before treatment and controlled release.

The Membriko standard specification for retention ponds uses 1.14 mm EPDM for ponds up to 3 metres maximum water depth serving standard urban catchments, or 1.5 mm EPDM for deeper ponds, motorway catchments with high hydrocarbon and suspended solid loads, or where APA licensing conditions specify infrastructure-grade geomembrane. Both are installed over a 300 g/m² non-woven polypropylene protection geotextile below and 200 g/m² geotextile above where a sacrificial protection layer is specified for regular maintenance access. Slopes are typically at 1:2 to 1:3 (vertical to horizontal). EPDM is terminated in a perimeter anchor trench at the design top water level plus 300 mm minimum freeboard.

Membriko has installed EPDM retention pond systems on motorway infrastructure projects to the Infraestruturas de Portugal geomembrane specification, urban development retention features from residential amenity ponds to multi-hectare commercial park lakes, and ecological compensation ponds created as habitat mitigation for development projects subject to AIA conditions.

### Bioswales (Valas de Biofiltração)

Bioswales are vegetated linear channels that slow, filter, and partially treat stormwater as it travels from its source — a road surface, car park, or impervious rooftop — towards a storage feature or receiving watercourse. The vegetation and its root zone perform active treatment: suspended solids are removed by physical filtration, hydrocarbons and heavy metals adsorb into the organic root zone, and microbial communities in the root zone biologically degrade organic compounds. A well-designed bioswale extends the residence time of stormwater runoff, dramatically improving water quality before discharge.

Membriko EPDM is installed in the base of bioswales when the native soil permeability is too high to maintain the water residence time required for effective treatment. In sandy or gravelly soils, stormwater passes through the root zone too quickly for biological treatment to occur before it reaches the groundwater. The EPDM base liner, at 1.0 to 1.14 mm thickness, creates a defined flow path with controlled infiltration only at specifically designed locations.

Root resistance is non-negotiable in bioswale applications. The growing medium sits directly above the EPDM membrane, and the vegetation root zone reaches the membrane surface within two to three years of establishment. Membriko specifies only EPDM that has passed the EN 13948 root resistance test — the same standard applied to green roof root barriers — for all bioswale applications. Generic waterproofing membranes without root resistance certification have no place in a planted stormwater feature.

### Detention Basins (Bacias de Detenção)

Detention basins serve a different purpose from retention ponds. Rather than maintaining a permanent water body, they are designed to be dry between storm events — multi-use spaces that might serve as recreational areas, car parks, or public parks in dry weather, and fill rapidly during a storm to provide the attenuation that prevents downstream flooding, before draining back to dry conditions within 24 to 48 hours.

This wet-dry cycling pattern is one of the most demanding performance conditions for any geomembrane. Materials that perform well when permanently wet may fail when subjected to repeated wetting and drying, prolonged UV exposure during dry periods, the thermal stress of summer sun on an exposed dark membrane, and the impact loading of debris and stormwater rushing in at the start of a fill event.

EPDM handles each of these demands better than its principal competitors. UV resistance is intrinsic — not a surface coating that can peel or abrade away, but a property of the carbon-black-loaded, saturated polymer backbone itself. During the months of summer when a detention basin in southern Portugal may not see a drop of water, the Membriko EPDM membrane sits undegraded under the sun, ready to perform identically to its state on the day of installation when the autumn rains eventually arrive. Thermal wrinkling — a well-documented problem with HDPE geomembrane in exposed applications — does not occur with EPDM because its thermal expansion coefficient is approximately one-tenth that of HDPE. The Membriko-installed membrane remains flat and stable throughout the temperature cycle.

Membriko supplies EPDM flanged pipe sleeve systems for the outlet control structures that penetrate the membrane in detention basin applications. These penetration systems use cold-applied QuickSeam adhesive and stainless steel compression rings — no silicone or mastic sealants that would require periodic replacement — creating permanent, watertight penetrations that the Membriko 20-year warranty covers alongside the field seams and parent membrane.

### Constructed Wetlands (Zonas Húmidas Construídas)

Constructed wetlands are engineered treatment systems that use aquatic plants, substrate, and microbial communities to treat contaminated water. In Portuguese stormwater management, they serve two primary functions: as polishing stages after primary settlement in retention ponds, removing residual suspended solids, nutrients, and dissolved organic compounds from stormwater before discharge to sensitive receiving water bodies; and as complete treatment systems for domestic wastewater in rural dispersed settlements not connected to the municipal sewer network, increasingly required by APA for rural building licences in sensitive catchments under the Water Framework Directive.

The ecological compatibility requirement is more stringent for constructed wetlands than for any other stormwater application. The microbial communities responsible for biological treatment are sensitive to contaminants from the membrane lining. The aquatic vegetation depends on water chemistry that is not disturbed by membrane leachates. The receiving water bodies that constructed wetlands protect may be classified waters of high ecological status under Lei 58/2005, where any additional chemical loading from the treatment system itself would represent a regulatory violation.

Membriko specifies only EPDM grades with established aquatic ecosystem compatibility for constructed wetland applications. The membrane contains no plasticisers — unlike PVC geomembranes, which have been shown to leach phthalate compounds into standing water at concentrations measurable in field conditions. Carbon black, which constitutes 30 to 50% of EPDM by weight, is physically entrapped in the cross-linked elastomeric matrix and does not leach. Membriko-supplied EPDM has been used in natural swimming pond, aquaculture, and conservation wetland applications across Europe with no adverse water quality effects documented.

## Section 4: SuDS Integration — Membriko's Role in the Design Team

A stormwater management project is not a membrane project. It is a civil engineering project, a hydrological modelling project, a regulatory compliance project, and increasingly an ecological design project. Membriko is a specialist contributor to this wider design team — not merely a materials supplier, but a technical partner that understands how EPDM membrane interfaces with every other discipline involved in SuDS design and delivery.

### The SuDS Hierarchy and Where Membriko Fits

The SuDS design hierarchy starts at source control — the smallest, most distributed interventions closest to where rain falls. Green roofs slow the first-flush response of buildings to rainfall. Permeable paving allows water to infiltrate where it falls rather than running off to drains. These measures reduce the volume and peak rate of runoff that needs to be managed by downstream systems. Membriko's EPDM expertise extends to green roofs — the same membrane that lines a retention pond can line a green roof water retention layer — creating integrated rainwater management from rooftop to pond within a single Membriko specification.

Where source control measures are insufficient to manage the remaining runoff — which is most commercial, industrial, and infrastructure development contexts — conveyance control takes over. Bioswales and filter strips slow and treat water as it moves towards collection points. Here, Membriko provides the base liner that creates the controlled flow path.

At the downstream end of the SuDS hierarchy, storage and treatment features — retention ponds, detention basins, constructed wetlands — provide the volume and residence time needed to attenuate peak flows and improve water quality before discharge. This is where Membriko EPDM does the most work by area, and where the technical specification is most critical.

### Design Collaboration

Membriko works directly with the civil engineers and hydraulic engineers who design stormwater retention structures to the LNEC published guidelines and EN 16933 standard (hydraulic design of sewers and stormwater systems). Membriko's technical input to the design process includes: confirmation of EPDM grade, thickness, and geotextile specification for the specific site conditions; anchor trench and edge termination design; penetration details for all inlet, outlet, and monitoring structures; and geotextile protection specification above the EPDM where maintenance access is anticipated.

Membriko also works with environmental consultants preparing Environmental Impact Assessment (AIA) submissions for projects subject to Decreto-Lei 151-B/2013. APA stormwater attenuation conditions commonly specify both the required performance — peak attenuation to greenfield rates, first-flush treatment for suspended solids and hydrocarbons — and the monitoring and reporting regime. Membriko provides full installation documentation including seam inspection records, as-built drawings, material conformity certificates, and independent test results, which forms part of the project's regulatory compliance file submitted to APA.

For projects where landscape architects are specifying SuDS features in public realm and urban park contexts, Membriko coordinates the technical specification of EPDM with the aesthetic and ecological requirements of the design. The membrane is invisible in service, but its specification — thickness, geotextile weights, anchor trench location relative to planting zones, root resistance certification in planted areas — determines whether the SuDS feature performs as designed over a 50-year life.

## Section 5: The Membriko Installation Process

Membriko's installation process for stormwater management projects follows eight defined stages, each coordinated with the civil contractor and the project's supervising engineer. Predictability and documentation are as important as technical quality: an APA-licensed stormwater system must be demonstrably compliant, not merely installed.

**Stage 1 — Technical Review and Sizing Consultation**

Membriko reviews the project's hydraulic design documentation: catchment parameters, design rainfall derived from SNIRH IDF data for the relevant meteorological station, retention volume, outflow control structure design, and pond geometry. From this review, Membriko confirms the EPDM specification — thickness, grade, geotextile weights, anchor trench dimensions, and penetration details — and issues a formal technical proposal. This consultation is provided at no charge to civil engineers and developers as part of Membriko's pre-contract technical service.

**Stage 2 — Earthwork and Substrate Coordination**

Membriko coordinates with the civil contractor on substrate preparation requirements before any membrane is delivered to site. Critical parameters: maximum allowable stone size in the prepared substrate surface (typically less than 20 mm for 1.14 mm EPDM, less than 40 mm for 1.5 mm EPDM); slope tolerance; anchor trench dimensions; and the sequencing of geotextile and EPDM installation relative to earthwork completion. Correct substrate preparation before the membrane arrives eliminates the most common cause of EPDM installation problems.

**Stage 3 — Material Delivery and On-site Organisation**

EPDM rolls — typically up to 15.25 m wide and available in custom lengths to minimise field seams — are delivered to site staged for sequential installation. The cut plan is confirmed against as-built earthwork dimensions. Seam positions are planned to keep field seams on flat areas rather than slope breaks where possible, and to minimise the total number of seams in the installation. Membriko's logistics planning for large pond installations above 5,000 m² includes on-site roll storage management to prevent membrane damage before installation.

**Stage 4 — Protection Geotextile Installation**

The lower protection geotextile — minimum 300 g/m² non-woven polypropylene, tested to EN ISO 9073-2 — is laid over the prepared substrate, anchored in the perimeter trench at the upper edge, with a minimum 500 mm overlap at all joints. This geotextile cushions the EPDM against any residual stone protrusions in the substrate and provides a stable base against which the EPDM can be pulled and positioned without risk of tearing on the substrate surface.

**Stage 5 — EPDM Membrane Deployment**

EPDM panels are unrolled and positioned according to the confirmed cut plan. Care is taken not to disturb the geotextile below. At approximately 1.4 kg/m² for 1.5 mm membrane, EPDM is relatively heavy — large panels require coordinated manual deployment. In exposed or windy conditions, Membriko uses temporary ballasting of deployed panels with sandbags or water-filled tubes to prevent wind uplift before seaming is complete.

**Stage 6 — Seaming and Penetrations**

All field seams are made using the QuickSeam tape and QuickPrime Plus primer system — a cold-applied adhesive system that produces seams of consistent quality at temperatures above 5°C and in conditions that would prevent hot-wedge welding of HDPE. Minimum seam width: 100 mm overlap with 75 mm effective bonded width. All penetrations — inlet pipes, outlet pipes, outflow control orifice plates, monitoring sensor conduits — are made using EPDM flanged sleeves and stainless steel compression rings, bonded with QuickSeam tape. Membriko dimensions and supplies all penetration accessories specific to each project.

**Stage 7 — Anchor Trench and Edge Termination**

The EPDM membrane is terminated in a perimeter anchor trench at the design top water level plus a minimum 300 mm freeboard. Trench dimensions are typically 300 mm wide by 300 mm deep. The membrane is folded into the trench and the trench is backfilled with selected granular material, compacted in layers. The anchor trench provides both physical restraint against hydrostatic uplift and protection of the membrane edge from UV exposure and mechanical damage. Membriko designs anchor trench details project-specifically based on pond geometry and soil conditions.

**Stage 8 — Inspection, Testing, and Documentation**

Following installation completion, Membriko carries out a systematic inspection programme: visual inspection of all seam lines for adhesion quality; mechanical seam probe test on 100% of seams (a dull probe drawn along the seam edge detects any areas of incomplete bonding); photographic as-built record with seam positions referenced to the anchor trench grid; and material conformity documentation (CE declaration of performance for EPDM, geotextile, and accessories). For critical applications — large motorway retention ponds, APA-licensed constructed wetlands — Electronic Leak Detection (ELD) survey is available as an additional quality assurance step. On satisfactory completion of inspection, the Membriko 20-year warranty is issued.

## Section 6: Sizing for Portuguese Rainfall Conditions

Stormwater retention system sizing in Portugal is a hydraulic engineering discipline governed by the LNEC published technical guidance and the IDF (Intensity-Duration-Frequency) data available from SNIRH, the Sistema Nacional de Informação de Recursos Hídricos. The final design of any stormwater retention system is the responsibility of the project's qualified civil or environmental engineer. However, Membriko provides preliminary sizing guidance as part of the pre-contract consultation process, allowing early-stage project teams to understand the approximate pond area and EPDM quantities before the full hydraulic design is complete.

### Portuguese Rainfall Context

Portugal's rainfall intensity varies significantly by region and is characterised by high variability that makes design more challenging than in more uniform climates. Typical 100-year return period rainfall depths in one hour, derived from SNIRH IDF data, are:

- Lisbon metropolitan area: 65 to 90 mm in one hour
- Porto metropolitan area: 55 to 75 mm in one hour
- Algarve (Faro area): 50 to 80 mm in one hour — with notably high variability between events
- Interior mountain catchments (Serra da Estrela, Serra do Gerês): 80 to 120 mm in one hour

These figures represent the rainfall intensity that stormwater infrastructure is commonly designed to manage without causing downstream flooding or water quality impacts to receiving water bodies.

### Design Return Periods

Portuguese stormwater engineering practice, following LNEC guidance and APA licensing requirements, typically applies the following design return periods:

- Urban drainage minor system (roadside gullies, drainage pipes): 2 to 10 years
- Major flood route and retention basin design: 100 years
- Critical infrastructure protecting major assets: 1,000 years or Probable Maximum Flood (PMF)

For retention ponds serving standard commercial and residential development catchments, the 100-year return period is the design standard expected by APA in licensing submissions. Membriko advises clients to confirm the applicable return period with APA at pre-application stage, as recent flood events have prompted some local licensing authorities to require more conservative design standards.

### Storage Volume Indicative Sizing

The storage volume required in a retention pond to attenuate peak runoff from an urban catchment to greenfield discharge rates depends on three primary parameters: the catchment area, the runoff coefficient of the catchment surfaces, and the allowable discharge rate.

Indicative values for Portugal:
- Runoff coefficient: 0.7 to 0.9 for dense urban commercial catchments; 0.5 to 0.7 for residential areas; 0.1 to 0.3 for green spaces
- Greenfield discharge rate (the rate a developed site must not exceed after development): typically 2 to 5 litres per second per hectare in Portuguese APA guidance
- Indicative storage volume: 200 to 500 m³ per hectare of impervious catchment for attenuation of a 100-year design event to greenfield rates

These are preliminary figures for early-stage planning. Project-specific design by a qualified hydraulic engineer, using SNIRH IDF data for the relevant meteorological station and site-specific runoff modelling, is required for all APA licensing submissions. Membriko coordinates with the hydraulic engineer to translate the design storage volume into an EPDM-lined pond geometry that fits the available site area and topography, providing cut plans and membrane quantity estimates as the design is refined.

### Climate Change Allowance

APA's technical guidance recommends applying a 20% increase to design rainfall depths for stormwater infrastructure with a design life exceeding 50 years, to account for the projected intensification of rainfall events under climate change scenarios. EPDM-lined stormwater systems installed by Membriko today are designed to a 50-year service life. If APA's climate change allowance is applied, these systems must be sized for effective performance through approximately 2076 — well into the period when climate projections for the Iberian Peninsula show significantly more intense design storms. Membriko advises all clients with infrastructure-grade stormwater systems to incorporate this climate allowance in the hydraulic design from the outset rather than attempting to retrofit additional storage capacity after construction.

## Section 7: EPDM vs HDPE vs Concrete vs Clay — The Technical Comparison

Specifiers evaluating geomembrane systems for stormwater applications in Portugal will encounter four principal competing approaches: EPDM, HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene), concrete lining, and compacted clay or bentonite geosynthetic liners. Each has genuine applications where it is the correct choice. For the range of conditions encountered in Portuguese stormwater management — Mediterranean climate with prolonged dry periods and intense storm events, earthwork substrates subject to differential settlement, ecologically designed permanent water bodies, and seasonally exposed detention basins — EPDM as supplied by Membriko offers the most technically versatile performance profile.

| Feature | EPDM (Membriko) | HDPE | Concrete | Compacted Clay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elongation at break | 400% — uniform elastic deformation | 200-700% (strain rate dependent, with stress whitening) | 0% — no elongation | 0% — no tensile strength |
| Settlement accommodation | Excellent — distributes strain uniformly | Moderate — wrinkling risk at large scale | None — differential settlement causes cracking | None — linear cracking |
| UV resistance (exposed periods) | Excellent — intrinsic to polymer | Good — but thermal wrinkling in exposed applications | Good | Poor — desiccation cracking in dry Portuguese summers |
| Seaming method | Cold adhesive tape — effective above 5°C, most weather | Hot wedge / extrusion weld — weather and temperature sensitive | Cast in place — no seams | Compaction overlap — quality difficult to verify |
| Ecological compatibility | Excellent — no plasticisers, no leachates | Good | Moderate — calcium leaching, pH elevation | Generally good |
| Root resistance | Certified to EN 13948 / FLL | Resistant but not systematically certified to European standards | None | None |
| Service life | 50+ years | 30 to 50 years | 20 to 40 years (cracking from settlement) | 20 to 30 years |
| Dry-period performance | Excellent — UV and desiccation resistant | Wrinkling under thermal expansion | Good | Desiccation cracking in southern Portugal conditions |
| Repair method | Cold-applied patch — quick, permanent, no dewatering needed | Hot weld — requires specialist equipment and dry conditions | Concrete patching — requires dewatering | Recompaction — difficult to quality-assure |

**The honest assessment from Membriko:** HDPE is competitive in very large-area installations where automated seam welding equipment can be mobilised economically and where the thermal wrinkling behaviour can be managed by appropriate panel sizing and anchorage design. Concrete lining remains appropriate for hydraulic channels with high abrasive sediment loads where EPDM would require heavy geotextile protection. Compacted clay is cost-effective in applications where suitable soil is available on site, year-round moisture keeps the clay active, and the pond will never experience a prolonged dry period — conditions that apply to few stormwater applications in Portugal south of the Tagus.

For the typical Portuguese stormwater retention or detention application — an earthwork structure in seasonally dry conditions, serving a catchment with moderate hydrocarbon and heavy metal loads, with ecological design requirements, and needing to maintain waterproof performance through summer drought and autumn storm events — EPDM as supplied and installed by Membriko is the most technically robust specification.

## Section 8: Environmental Performance — Water Quality, Habitat, and Groundwater

The environmental performance of an EPDM-lined stormwater system extends well beyond the membrane's own chemical inertness. EPDM creates the conditions for stormwater systems to deliver genuine environmental benefits: improved water quality in receiving watercourses, habitat creation for native wildlife, and protection of groundwater resources from uncontrolled stormwater contamination.

### Water Quality in the Retained Water Body

A retention pond is not merely a storage tank. The residence time the pond provides — typically hours to days between storm events and the controlled discharge — creates the conditions for natural water quality improvement processes to operate. Suspended solids settle out of the water column. Ultraviolet light from the sun photo-degrades certain organic compounds. Microbial communities in the sediment and water column biodegrade hydrocarbons and organic nutrients. Aquatic vegetation absorbs nitrogen and phosphorus, reducing the nutrient load that reaches receiving watercourses.

The membrane lining needs to support these processes without interfering with them. Membriko EPDM does not leach calcium carbonate, which concrete lining does, raising water pH and suppressing aquatic biodiversity. It does not leach phthalate plasticisers, which PVC geomembranes do, with endocrine disruption effects on aquatic organisms documented in laboratory studies. It does not contribute turbidity or suspended particulates, which clay liners do, particularly in freshly installed and low-flow conditions. The water quality inside a Membriko EPDM-lined retention pond is governed by the stormwater chemistry itself and the natural treatment processes it undergoes — not by the membrane beneath it.

### Habitat Creation and Wildlife Support

EPDM-lined retention ponds have been used extensively by conservation organisations in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany for ecological habitat creation — specifically because of their proven ecological inertness. In Portugal, stormwater retention ponds required by APA as mitigation conditions for development projects are increasingly designed as ecological assets: habitats for native amphibians including Discoglossus galganoi, Pelodytes punctatus, and Triturus pygmaeus, all of which breed in seasonally shallow ponds; for invertebrate communities including dragonflies, water beetles, and caddisflies; and as foraging habitat for waterfowl and wading birds.

Membriko EPDM, combined with an appropriate substrate design in the shallow margins at 50 to 200 mm water depth, supports colonisation by emergent aquatic vegetation — common reed (Phragmites australis), bulrush (Typha spp.), and water mint (Mentha aquatica) — within one to two growing seasons of pond establishment. This vegetation cover provides both ecological value and the root zone treatment function that improves stormwater water quality through the settling season between storm events.

### Groundwater Protection

One of the primary functions of a lined retention pond is to prevent contaminated stormwater from reaching the groundwater below the pond. This is particularly important in Portugal where aquifer systems — including the important Maciço Calcário Estremenho system that underlies the Pombal and Leiria area, where Membriko is based — are used for drinking water abstraction and are sensitive to contamination from urban and agricultural runoff.

Membriko EPDM provides continuous, tested impermeability to groundwater from contaminated stormwater. Where controlled infiltration of treated stormwater is desired to recharge groundwater — a legitimate objective in areas of declining water table, and one recognised in APA's water resource management guidance — Membriko can design infiltration trenches in the pond margins positioned outside the main EPDM liner, allowing treated pond water to infiltrate to groundwater at a controlled rate after natural attenuation of pollutants within the pond.

### Carbon Sequestration

Stormwater retention ponds that support established aquatic and emergent vegetation sequester carbon in plant biomass and in the organic matter that accumulates in the pond sediment. Membriko-specified EPDM ponds with established vegetation communities can make a positive contribution to project carbon budgets — a relevant consideration as Portuguese developers and infrastructure operators face increasing pressure to demonstrate carbon neutrality in Environmental Impact Assessment submissions.

## Section 10: Maintenance of EPDM-Lined Stormwater Systems

One of the commercially significant advantages of EPDM geomembrane in stormwater infrastructure is its low whole-life maintenance requirement. The EPDM membrane itself requires no scheduled maintenance over its 50-year design life: no resurfacing, no re-sealing, no chemical treatment, no specialist inspection between the annual visual inspections. The maintenance requirements of a Membriko EPDM-lined stormwater system are those of the stormwater system as a whole — principally sediment management and vegetation control — not those of the membrane lining.

### Annual Visual Inspection

Membriko recommends an annual visual inspection of the EPDM membrane, conducted during the low-water or dry period that occurs naturally in most Portuguese stormwater systems during summer. The inspection covers: the perimeter anchor trench and edge termination for any evidence of trench disturbance or membrane exposure; penetration seals at all inlet, outlet, and monitoring structures for any evidence of mechanical damage; and the general membrane surface for any evidence of damage from maintenance equipment, animal activity, or debris impact during storm events.

The inspection record forms part of the maintenance file that Membriko recommends be maintained for all APA-licensed stormwater systems. A clean annual inspection record demonstrates the continued integrity of the containment system and supports warranty validity throughout the Membriko 20-year warranty period.

### Sediment Management

Stormwater retention ponds accumulate sediment at rates that vary with catchment land use and event frequency: typically 20 to 100 mm per year of bulk sediment deposition, with the highest accumulation rates in the first storm events after construction and in years with frequent intense events. The sediment must be removed periodically — typically every 5 to 15 years depending on accumulation rate — to maintain the design storage volume.

Sediment removal is typically accomplished by tracked excavator on the dry pond bed, or by suction dredging in ponds that cannot be fully dewatered. Where excavator access is required, Membriko recommends installing a sacrificial upper geotextile (200 g/m² minimum) over the EPDM during the original installation, specifically to protect the membrane from excavator bucket contact during future maintenance operations. This geotextile adds minimal cost to the original Membriko installation and eliminates the risk of membrane damage during the 5 to 15 year dredging cycle.

### Vegetation Management

In ponds designed for ecological benefit, emergent vegetation on the shallow margins should be managed periodically to prevent excessive root development from progressively penetrating the membrane surface. EN 13948-certified EPDM has demonstrated root resistance in systematic testing by independent laboratories, and Membriko specifies only root-certified membrane grades, so the risk is low. Prudent management practice involves cutting back aggressive emergent species — particularly Phragmites australis, which produces vigorous rhizomes — on an annual or biennial basis to limit root density at the membrane surface.

### Seam and Membrane Repair

If localised membrane damage occurs — from a sharp stone impacted by maintenance equipment, animal burrowing at the anchor trench perimeter, or debris with penetrating edges deposited during storm events — EPDM repair is straightforward and permanent. Cold-applied EPDM patch systems restore full membrane integrity without requiring dewatering: underwater EPDM adhesive systems allow below-waterline repairs to be made in permanently wet ponds without the disruption and cost of full pond dewatering. This repairability is a significant operational advantage over concrete lining (which requires full dewatering, grinding, and cementitious patching) and HDPE (which requires specialist hot-weld equipment and dry conditions).

### 25-Year Formal Inspection

Membriko recommends commissioning a formal documented inspection at the 25-year point of any installed EPDM stormwater system. This inspection includes seam probe testing on a systematic grid, photographic documentation of the full membrane surface, and — for critical licensed systems — an ELD (Electronic Leak Detection) survey. The 25-year inspection provides the basis for warranty extension, planned maintenance budgeting, or membrane replacement planning as the system approaches the end of its initial 50-year design life.

## Section 11: The Portuguese Regulatory Framework for Stormwater Management

Portuguese stormwater management operates within a regulatory framework that combines European directives, national legislation, and APA licensing requirements. Understanding this framework is essential for specifiers seeking to design stormwater systems that not only perform hydraulically, but satisfy APA conditions and demonstrate compliance to the satisfaction of ERSAR and municipal authorities. Membriko provides full technical documentation to support APA submissions for all installed systems.

### Lei da Água (Lei 58/2005) — The Water Framework Directive in Portugal

Portugal's Water Law transposes the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), establishing the obligation to achieve and maintain good ecological status in all surface water bodies by 2027. This has direct implications for stormwater management: any stormwater discharge system that degrades the ecological or chemical status of a receiving water body classified under the Water Framework Directive is in regulatory breach. EPDM-lined retention and treatment systems that improve the water quality of stormwater before discharge are a concrete engineering response to this regulatory obligation, and Membriko's installation documentation supports the demonstration of compliance.

### Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007 — Water Resource Use Licensing

This Decreto-Lei establishes the licensing framework administered by APA for the use of water resources, including the construction and operation of stormwater retention and detention structures above defined volume thresholds, and the discharge of stormwater to watercourses. Membriko provides full technical documentation packages — conformity certificates, installation records, seam test reports, as-built drawings — that support APA licensing submissions for stormwater infrastructure. The Membriko documentation package is structured to meet the technical evidence requirements of the Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007 licensing process.

### Environmental Impact Assessment (Decreto-Lei 151-B/2013)

Large infrastructure projects — motorways, commercial developments above 5 hectares, industrial facilities above defined thresholds — are subject to EIA under the transposition of EU Directive 2011/92/EU. AIA decisions commonly impose conditions requiring quantitative stormwater attenuation, first-flush treatment, and long-term monitoring of discharge water quality. EPDM-lined retention and treatment systems specified and installed by Membriko are the standard engineering response to these AIA conditions. Membriko has prepared technical documentation for AIA submissions on behalf of project developers and their environmental consultants on multiple infrastructure projects across Portugal.

### Portaria 175/2012

This Portaria establishes technical norms for the quality of wastewater discharges. It is relevant to stormwater management in two contexts: where constructed wetlands are used to treat combined stormwater and domestic wastewater in rural areas not connected to the municipal sewer; and where stormwater from industrial or agricultural catchments contains pollutants at concentrations that bring it within the scope of wastewater discharge regulation. EPDM-lined constructed wetland systems specified by Membriko to achieve the effluent quality standards of Portaria 175/2012 are a growing application area, particularly in sensitive river catchments where APA rural licensing requirements are most stringent.

### Municipal SuDS Plans

An increasing number of Portuguese municipalities — including Lisboa, Porto, Braga, Aveiro, and Coimbra — are developing Planos Municipais de Gestão de Águas Pluviais that introduce specific stormwater management requirements for new development. Common requirements include maximum post-development discharge rates of 10 to 20 litres per second per hectare, mandatory on-site attenuation for developments above defined areas, and use of SuDS techniques in public space design. EPDM-lined stormwater systems sized by Membriko in collaboration with the project's hydraulic engineer provide the documented hydraulic performance evidence needed to satisfy these municipal requirements in planning and building licence applications.

### ERSAR Guidance

ERSAR, the Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos, provides guidance on urban drainage system management including stormwater. Quality-assured EPDM installations with documented seam testing, material conformity certificates, and as-built records — the standard Membriko documentation package — contribute to demonstrating regulatory compliance with ERSAR quality management expectations for stormwater infrastructure operators.

## Section 12: Climate Change Adaptation — Designing for the Next 50 Years

The climate projections for the Iberian Peninsula are among the most severe in Europe for water management implications. The IPCC's regional assessment for Southern Europe, reinforced by Portugal's national climate adaptation strategy (ENAAC 2020 and its successor P-3A — Programa de Ação para a Adaptação às Alterações Climáticas), projects a combination of changes that are specifically challenging for stormwater management infrastructure designed to historical rainfall frequencies.

### What the Projections Say

Mean temperature across Portugal is projected to increase by 1.5 to 3°C by 2050 under moderate emissions scenarios, and by 3 to 5°C by 2100 under high-emissions scenarios. This warming intensifies the drought character of Portuguese summers — longer periods of no rainfall, higher temperatures accelerating evapotranspiration, and soils that are more thoroughly desiccated before the autumn rains begin.

Annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease in southern Portugal by 10 to 20% by 2050, but this reduction is concentrated in already dry seasons. The winter rainfall that causes flooding is not decreasing, and in many projections is intensifying as warmer Atlantic ocean temperatures fuel more energetic frontal systems. The practical consequence is the worst possible scenario for urban stormwater management: more intense individual storm events, falling on soils that are more thoroughly dry and hydrophobic from longer summer droughts, generating faster and more extreme runoff responses from urban catchments that are simultaneously growing in impervious area.

### APA's Design Guidance on Climate Change

APA recommends applying a 20% increase to design rainfall depths for stormwater infrastructure with a design life exceeding 50 years. This means that a retention pond designed today to manage the 100-year return period storm event should be sized for 120% of the rainfall depth derived from current SNIRH IDF data. For infrastructure in southern Portugal, where the 100-year one-hour rainfall depth is in the range of 50 to 80 mm, the climate-adjusted design event approaches 60 to 96 mm per hour — a significant increase in required storage volume and EPDM liner area.

Membriko advises all clients designing stormwater infrastructure with 50-year horizons to incorporate APA's climate change allowance in the hydraulic design from the outset. Enlarging a pond after construction is possible but disruptive and expensive. Sizing it correctly in the first instance, using the climate-adjusted design event, is the prudent investment — particularly given that Membriko EPDM-lined systems require no scheduled membrane replacement over the 50-year design life, making the upfront investment in correct pond sizing the dominant cost decision.

### Why EPDM Is the Climate-Adaptive Specification

EPDM as supplied by Membriko has properties that are specifically well-matched to the climate trajectory projected for Portugal:

**UV and desiccation resistance** — as dry periods between storm events lengthen, the exposed membrane in detention basins spends more time in the full-sun, high-temperature condition that is most demanding for geomembranes. EPDM's UV resistance is intrinsic and permanent, not a surface coating. It performs identically after ten years of Portuguese summer exposure as on the day of Membriko installation.

**Thermal stability** — higher summer temperatures increase the thermal stress on geomembranes. EPDM's service temperature of -45°C to +130°C and its low thermal expansion coefficient mean it remains flat, stable, and dimensionally accurate regardless of the temperature extremes projected for southern Portugal by 2050 and beyond.

**Settlement accommodation** — more intense rainfall events generate more extreme hydrodynamic forces within retention ponds during fill events, including wave action on embankment slopes and velocity forces at inlet structures. EPDM's 400% elongation provides inherent energy absorption that rigid linings cannot match, and distributes concentrated loading across the membrane surface without point failure.

**Adaptability to future sizing** — if a pond needs to be enlarged to accommodate increased design events arising from revised climate projections, the EPDM lining is simply cut larger and a new anchor trench established at the revised perimeter. The fundamental Membriko system remains intact. EPDM membrane installed by Membriko today is designed to accommodate future extension without full membrane replacement.

The Membriko 20-year warranty and 50-year design life mean that EPDM-lined stormwater systems installed today are designed to serve through the period when Iberian Peninsula climate projections show the most significant divergence from historical conditions. Membriko-installed membrane is designed for the climate of 2076, not only the climate of 2026.

## Section 13: Urban and Rural Applications — The Full Range of Portuguese Stormwater Contexts

Stormwater management challenges in Portugal span from dense urban contexts — where space is scarce, the public is present, and aesthetic expectations of public realm design apply — to remote rural catchments where large-scale earthwork structures serve infrastructure with no human presence at all. Membriko's EPDM expertise is applied across this full range.

### Urban Applications

**Small urban bioswales and rain gardens** — vegetated channels and planted basins serving car parks, pedestrian streets, and commercial developments in municipalities implementing SuDS requirements. Typically 50 to 500 m² of Membriko EPDM membrane area. Root-resistant EN 13948-certified EPDM is non-negotiable in these applications. Membriko works with landscape architects at schematic design stage to integrate the EPDM specification into the planting design, ensuring compatibility between the membrane specification and the planted species selected.

**Urban retention ponds in public parks** — serving the stormwater attenuation requirements of residential and mixed-use development catchments, designed as permanent amenity water features with ecological planting and public access margins. Typically 500 to 5,000 m² of Membriko EPDM surface. Requires careful geotextile specification for public safety — no sharp membrane edges exposed at pond margins — and anchor trench design that integrates with landscape planting. Membriko has specified and installed EPDM systems for public park ponds in several Portuguese municipalities, coordinating with the municipality's engineering and parks departments.

**Underground stormwater tanks** — where surface space for open ponds is unavailable, precast concrete tank systems under urban plazas and car parks can be lined with EPDM to provide watertight below-ground storage. Membriko provides EPDM lining specifications for underground tank applications, including base waterproofing and wall lining details compatible with precast concrete construction.

**Roof stormwater harvesting** — EPDM flat roof as the primary rainwater collection surface, draining to a below-ground storage tank lined with Membriko EPDM or constructed as a watertight concrete tank, for non-potable reuse in irrigation, toilet flushing, or cooling water systems. Membriko provides integrated roof-to-tank membrane specifications, ensuring consistent EPDM chemistry throughout the rainwater collection system and a single Membriko warranty covering both elements.

### Rural and Infrastructure Applications

**Motorway and road retention ponds** — the largest single application category in terms of pond area for Membriko. Motorway catchments in Portugal — the A1, A2, A3, A25, and IP5 corridors all pass through environmentally sensitive catchments — are required by APA and by the Infraestruturas de Portugal geomembrane specification to provide stormwater treatment and attenuation before discharge to receiving watercourses. Pond areas of 2,000 to 20,000 m² are typical for major road infrastructure. Membriko has installed EPDM systems for major Portuguese road infrastructure projects to the Infraestruturas de Portugal technical specification, providing full documentation for the regulatory compliance file.

**Agricultural stormwater management** — retention of irrigation runoff and farmyard drainage to prevent nitrate and phosphate loading of adjacent watercourses, particularly in the intensive agricultural areas of the Alentejo and Ribatejo. EPDM's chemical inertness to fertiliser and pesticide compounds makes it the appropriate lining for agricultural water management features. Retained water can be reused for irrigation, supplementing winter storage with summer irrigation supply and reducing dependence on groundwater abstraction.

**Quarry and mining drainage** — stormwater separation from process water at quarry and aggregate processing sites, where the variable pH and high suspended solids load of combined drainage would exceed the discharge quality limits of Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007 without pre-treatment. EPDM's resistance across pH 2 to 12 and to high suspended solid concentrations makes it suitable for retention pond lining in quarry drainage applications.

**Rural constructed wetlands** — the most technically demanding application for EPDM ecological compatibility, treating combined stormwater and domestic wastewater in dispersed rural settlements where municipal sewer connection is not feasible. APA is increasingly requiring constructed wetland treatment for rural building licences in sensitive catchments, particularly within river basin management plan areas where the Water Framework Directive good ecological status objective requires protection of the receiving water body. Membriko works with environmental engineers to specify EPDM for these systems, where membrane ecological compatibility is as important as hydraulic performance.

## Section 14: Frequently Asked Questions

**What thickness of EPDM membrane should be specified for a standard stormwater retention pond?**

For standard stormwater retention ponds on earthwork substrates with maximum water depth up to 3 metres serving typical urban catchments, Membriko's standard specification is 1.14 mm EPDM over a 300 g/m² non-woven polypropylene protection geotextile. Where the maximum water depth exceeds 3 metres, where the catchment has high hydrocarbon or suspended solid loads such as motorway catchments, or where APA licensing conditions specify infrastructure-grade geomembrane, 1.5 mm EPDM with a 400 g/m² protection geotextile is recommended. Membriko provides site-specific specification advice as part of the pre-contract technical consultation — at no charge to the civil engineer or developer.

**Can EPDM membrane withstand the wet-dry cycling of detention basins that are empty for months at a time in Portuguese summers?**

Yes — and this is one of EPDM's clearest advantages over competing geomembrane materials in Portuguese conditions. During the dry periods when a detention basin is empty and the membrane is fully exposed to summer sun, EPDM's UV resistance — intrinsic to the carbon-black-loaded, saturated polymer backbone, not a surface treatment that can degrade — prevents photochemical degradation. Its service temperature ceiling of +130°C means it withstands the 60°C or higher surface temperatures that a dark membrane exposed to direct solar radiation can reach on a Portuguese summer afternoon. When the autumn rains refill the basin, the Membriko EPDM membrane performs identically to its condition on the day of installation: no UV fatigue, no desiccation cracking, no dimensional change from thermal cycling.

**How is EPDM membrane anchored at the top edge of an excavated pond?**

The standard Membriko anchoring system uses a perimeter anchor trench excavated at the design top water level plus a minimum 300 mm freeboard. The trench is typically 300 mm wide and 300 mm deep. The EPDM membrane is folded into the trench — which locks the membrane against hydrostatic uplift forces during high water events — and the trench is then backfilled and compacted with selected granular material in layers. The folded membrane end within the trench is sealed with EPDM lap adhesive to prevent water ingress along the membrane-trench interface. The anchor trench also protects the membrane edge from UV exposure and physical damage. Membriko designs anchor trench details project-specifically based on pond geometry, soil conditions, and the civil contractor's earthwork sequence.

**Is EPDM membrane compatible with aquatic wildlife and the biological processes of constructed wetlands?**

Yes. EPDM is the material of choice for ecologically designed retention ponds and constructed wetlands across Europe precisely because of its proven aquatic ecosystem compatibility. It contains no plasticisers — unlike PVC geomembranes, which leach phthalate compounds into standing water at concentrations associated with endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms. Carbon black, which makes up 30 to 50% of EPDM by weight, is physically entrapped in the cross-linked elastomeric matrix and does not leach into water. Membriko-supplied EPDM has been used in natural swimming ponds, aquaculture facilities, and conservation wetlands across Europe with no adverse water quality effects. EPDM-lined ponds are routinely used by conservation organisations in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany for habitat creation for amphibians, invertebrates, and waterfowl.

**What European and Portuguese standards govern the specification of geomembrane for stormwater ponds?**

The primary European product standard for synthetic geomembrane materials is EN 13956 (flexible membranes for waterproofing — synthetic polymer sheets used underground), under which Membriko's EPDM bears CE marking. For geosynthetic applications in earthwork structures relevant to stormwater containment, the standards EN 13361 (geosynthetics for reservoirs and dams), EN 13362 (canals), and EN 13491 (geotextile barriers) apply. Performance testing standards include EN 12311-2 (tensile properties), EN 12691 (puncture resistance), EN 1928 (hydrostatic watertightness), and EN ISO 4892-3 (UV resistance). The Portuguese regulatory framework governing stormwater infrastructure is principally Lei 58/2005 (Water Law), Decreto-Lei 226-A/2007 (water resource use licensing), and APA's technical guidance on stormwater discharge licensing conditions. Membriko provides a complete documentation package for all installed systems, structured for inclusion in APA licensing dossiers.

**Can Membriko install EPDM membrane during winter, when construction projects are most active in Portugal?**

Yes — and this is a significant practical advantage over HDPE geomembrane in the Portuguese construction calendar. EPDM seaming uses the cold-applied QuickSeam tape and QuickPrime Plus adhesive system, which remains effective at temperatures above 5°C and can be applied in light rain provided the seam surfaces are clean and dry at the point of adhesive application. The hot-wedge and extrusion-welding systems used for HDPE seaming are more sensitive to temperature and ambient moisture conditions. The primary limitation on winter EPDM installation is the civil contractor's ability to complete earthworks to specification in wet soil conditions — not the Membriko membrane installation itself. Membriko coordinates closely with the civil contractor to sequence membrane delivery and installation immediately after earthwork completion.

**How are outlet control structures and inlet pipes connected through the EPDM membrane without creating leak paths?**

All penetrations through Membriko EPDM membrane — inlet pipes, outlet pipes, outflow control orifice plates, water level monitoring sensors, and any other through-membrane element — are made using a certified EPDM flanged pipe sleeve and stainless steel compression ring system. The procedure: the EPDM membrane is cut to the pipe diameter; a QuickSeam adhesive bond is applied around the pipe penetration to the parent membrane; the EPDM flanged sleeve is positioned over the bonded area; and the stainless steel compression ring is torqued to a specified load, creating a permanent mechanical seal. No silicone or polysulphide mastic sealants are used as primary seals, because these materials have finite service lives that are incompatible with the 50-year design life of the Membriko membrane system. All penetration accessories are dimensioned and supplied by Membriko specific to each project's pipe sizes and outflow control structure details.

**How does the whole-life cost of Membriko EPDM compare to concrete or HDPE for stormwater pond lining?**

On initial material and installation cost, EPDM as supplied by Membriko is broadly comparable to HDPE on a per-square-metre basis, and higher than compacted clay where native material is available on site. Concrete lining carries a higher initial cost than EPDM for comparable areas. The 50-year service life of Membriko EPDM — without scheduled membrane replacement, resurfacing, or chemical treatment — produces a whole-life cost position that is favourable against all competing materials when the analysis extends beyond 15 to 20 years. Concrete lining of stormwater channels requires crack repair at 15 to 25 year intervals as ground settlement and thermal cycling produce hairline cracking; each repair requires dewatering, specialist concrete repair work, and disruption to the system's stormwater function. Clay liners in southern Portugal require monitoring and potential repair of desiccation cracking after prolonged dry summers. HDPE replacement at 30 to 50 years involves full membrane removal and reinstallation. Membriko EPDM avoids all of these whole-life costs. Membriko provides indicative whole-life cost comparisons on request as part of project specification consultations, enabling clients to make investment decisions on the basis of 50-year total cost rather than initial outlay alone.

## Closing: Stormwater Management Is Infrastructure — Treat It as Such

Portugal's stormwater challenge will not diminish over the coming decades. Climate projections for the Iberian Peninsula are unequivocal: longer dry summers, more intense winter storms, and reduced mean annual precipitation in the south create precisely the conditions under which unmanaged urban runoff becomes most damaging — to property, to water quality, to groundwater resources, and to the ecological status of rivers and estuaries that Portugal is legally obligated to protect under European law.

The engineering response to this challenge works. SuDS — retention ponds, detention basins, bioswales, constructed wetlands — reduces peak flows, improves water quality, creates habitat, and protects groundwater. But these systems work only if the membrane lining at their core performs reliably over the decades the infrastructure is expected to serve. A retention pond with a cracked concrete lining is not attenuating peak flows to the APA-licensed rate. A detention basin with a desiccated clay liner is not containing the first-flush hydrocarbon load from the car park it serves. A constructed wetland with a plasticiser-leaching PVC base is not providing the ecological treatment function for which it was designed and licensed.

Membriko, based in Pombal, Leiria, at the heart of central Portugal's infrastructure corridor, has built its work on supplying and installing EPDM geomembrane systems that perform reliably over 50-year horizons. Not because EPDM is simply a good membrane material — though it is — but because the Membriko specification combines the right EPDM grade, the right protection geotextile, the right seaming system, correctly engineered penetrations, and documented installation quality, all backed by Membriko's 20-year warranty and the full documentation package needed for APA regulatory compliance.

Whether you are designing a small urban bioswale serving a car park in Coimbra, specifying a motorway retention pond on an IP infrastructure project in the Alentejo, or preparing an AIA submission for a commercial development in the Lisbon metropolitan area, contact Membriko for a preliminary technical consultation. The consultation is provided at no charge. The specification advice is based on experience with European EPDM geomembrane practice adapted to the specific conditions of Portuguese climate, regulation, and civil engineering. And the result is a stormwater system built to serve reliably through whatever the Iberian climate brings over the next half-century.
